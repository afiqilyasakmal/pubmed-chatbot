34450083,Worldwide trends in hypertension prevalence and progress in treatment and control from 1990 to 2019: a pooled analysis of 1201 population-representative studies with 104 million participants.,"BACKGROUND: Hypertension can be detected at the primary health-care level and low-cost treatments can effectively control hypertension. We aimed to measure the prevalence of hypertension and progress in its detection, treatment, and control from 1990 to 2019 for 200 countries and territories. METHODS: We used data from 1990 to 2019 on people aged 30-79 years from population-representative studies with measurement of blood pressure and data on blood pressure treatment. We defined hypertension as having systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or greater, diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg or greater, or taking medication for hypertension. We applied a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the prevalence of hypertension and the proportion of people with hypertension who had a previous diagnosis (detection), who were taking medication for hypertension (treatment), and whose hypertension was controlled to below 140/90 mm Hg (control). The model allowed for trends over time to be non-linear and to vary by age. FINDINGS: The number of people aged 30-79 years with hypertension doubled from 1990 to 2019, from 331 (95% credible interval 306-359) million women and 317 (292-344) million men in 1990 to 626 (584-668) million women and 652 (604-698) million men in 2019, despite stable global age-standardised prevalence. In 2019, age-standardised hypertension prevalence was lowest in Canada and Peru for both men and women; in Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and some countries in western Europe including Switzerland, Spain, and the UK for women; and in several low-income and middle-income countries such as Eritrea, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and Solomon Islands for men. Hypertension prevalence surpassed 50% for women in two countries and men in nine countries, in central and eastern Europe, central Asia, Oceania, and Latin America. Globally, 59% (55-62) of women and 49% (46-52) of men with hypertension reported a previous diagnosis of hypertension in 2019, and 47% (43-51) of women and 38% (35-41) of men were treated. Control rates among people with hypertension in 2019 were 23% (20-27) for women and 18% (16-21) for men. In 2019, treatment and control rates were highest in South Korea, Canada, and Iceland (treatment >70%; control >50%), followed by the USA, Costa Rica, Germany, Portugal, and Taiwan. Treatment rates were less than 25% for women and less than 20% for men in Nepal, Indonesia, and some countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania. Control rates were below 10% for women and men in these countries and for men in some countries in north Africa, central and south Asia, and eastern Europe. Treatment and control rates have improved in most countries since 1990, but we found little change in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania. Improvements were largest in high-income countries, central Europe, and some upper-middle-income and recently high-income countries including Costa Rica, Taiwan, Kazakhstan, South Africa, Brazil, Chile, Turkey, and Iran. INTERPRETATION: Improvements in the detection, treatment, and control of hypertension have varied substantially across countries, with some middle-income countries now outperforming most high-income nations. The dual approach of reducing hypertension prevalence through primary prevention and enhancing its treatment and control is achievable not only in high-income countries but also in low-income and middle-income settings.

28790231,"Inflammation, Immunity, and Hypertension.","The immune system, inflammation and hypertension are related to each other. Innate and adaptive immunity system triggers an inflammatory process, in which blood pressure may increase, stimulating organ damage. Cells in innate immune system produce ROS, such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, which aimed at killing pathogens. Long-term inflammation process increases ROS production, causing oxidative stress which leads to endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial function is to regulate blood vessel tone and structure. When inflammation lasts, NO bioavailability decreases, disrupting its main function as vasodilator, so that blood vessels relaxation and vasodilatation are absent. Effector T cells and regulatory lymphocytes, part of the adaptive immune system, plays role in blood vessels constriction in hypertension. Signals from central nervous system and APC activates effector T lymphocyte differentiation and accelerate through Th-1 and Th-17 phenotypes. Th-1 and Th-17 effectors participate in inflammation which leads to increased blood pressure. One part of CD4+ is the regulatory T cells (Tregs) that suppress immune response activation as they produce immunosuppressive cytokines, such as TGF-beta and IL-10. Adoptive transfer of Tregs cells can reduce oxidative stress in blood vessels, endothelial dysfunction, infiltration of aortic macrophages and T cells as well as proinflammatory cytokine levels in plasma circulation.","Agita A, Alsagaff MT",Acta Med Indones,2017 Apr,Hypertension AND Indonesia
34040936,Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension in Indonesia: Current Status and Local Application of International Guidelines.,"Recent advances in the diagnosis and management of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have led to a significant improvement in the outcomes for patients with PAH. However, prompt and accurate diagnosis of PAH remains an unmet challenge due to lack of awareness and lack of meticulous data to profile the etiology and pathophysiology of this rare progressive disease, especially in low- and middle-income country. In Indonesia, the true prevalence and incidence of different subtypes of PAH in general population is still unknown. The Congenital HeARt Disease in adult and Pulmonary Hypertension (COHARD-PH) registry was the first single-center prospective registry in Indonesia, which indicated that almost 80% of adult patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) had experienced PAH and even Eisenmenger syndrome due to delayed diagnosis. Screening for early detection of asymptomatic CHD in children is yet to be systematically established in Indonesia, leading to undiagnosed and uncorrected CHD in adulthood. There are no specific national guidelines focusing on diagnostic workup and treatment of PAH in Indonesia. Furthermore, the lack of adequate diagnostic facilities, limited treatment availability, and limited drug coverage under the National Health Insurance Scheme are key issues that remain unaddressed. This review focuses on the diagnosis, treatment, and management of PAH associated with CHD in Indonesia as per international guidelines. We have proposed recommendations to effectively control and prevent PAH associated with CHD in Indonesia. The paper should be of interest to readers in the area of medical management and policy makers especially in low- and middle-income countries. KEY HIGHLIGHTS: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare progressive subtype of pulmonary hypertension with poor overall prognosis and outcomes.Prompt and accurate diagnosis of PAH remains an unmet challenge in low- and middle-income countries due to poor knowledge about the etiology and pathophysiology of this syndrome. Also, the symptoms and signs of early-stage PAH are usually nonspecific or undetectable in newborn and infants, thus presenting a challenge for physicians to establish early diagnoses of PAH.The challenging factors in low- and middle-income countries, especially Indonesia archipelago are limitations of healthcare infrastructure, limited expertise, lack of awareness, lack of timely PAH screening strategies, poor antenatal care and unpredictable availability of PAH medications.There are no specific national guidelines focusing on diagnostic workup and treatment of PAH in Indonesia. Under-utilization of treatment guidelines and lack of adequate diagnostic treatment facilities have resulted in sub-optimal management of PAH patients in Indonesia.Adherence to international guidelines is an important aspect of PAH management in Indonesia. Updated disease and functional classifications of PAH as per international guidelines along with new research findings on prognostic factors can help in making better management decisions for PAH patients at different stages of the disease.","Dinarti LK, Anggrahini DW, Lilyasari O, Siswanto BB, Hartopo AB",Glob Heart,2021 Apr 20,Hypertension AND Indonesia
31680397,"Asian management of hypertension: Current status, home blood pressure, and specific concerns in Indonesia.","Over one-third of the population in Indonesia has hypertension, almost two-thirds of treated patients have uncontrolled blood pressure (BP), and the majority of patients with hypertension also have comorbidities. Home BP monitoring (HBPM) is a useful tool for diagnosing and managing hypertension. The use of HBPM is recommended by the latest consensus from the Indonesian Society of Hypertension (2019), and nearly, all doctors recommend HBPM for hypertensive patients. However, the use of HBPM in Indonesia is limited by the cost of devices and a perception that these devices are unreliable. In addition, knowledge about proper procedures is lacking. Withdrawal of mercury sphygmomanometers from the end of 2018 is expected to encourage the use of digital sphygmomanometers and the implementation of HBPM. The most common antihypertensive agent used in Indonesia varies by patient age, being angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in those aged 40-60 years and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) in older patients. Across all age groups, combination therapy with a CCB plus an angiotensin receptor blocker was common (41%-42% of patients). The high prevalence of hypertension in Indonesia has an important economic impact, and approaches to increase awareness of the disease and adherence to therapy are needed, particularly given data showing the benefits of strict BP control.","Turana Y, Tengkawan J, Soenarta AA",J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich),2020 Mar,Hypertension AND Indonesia
28097354,"Global Burden of Hypertension and Systolic Blood Pressure of at Least 110 to 115 mm Hg, 1990-2015.","IMPORTANCE: Elevated systolic blood (SBP) pressure is a leading global health risk. Quantifying the levels of SBP is important to guide prevention policies and interventions. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association between SBP of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg and SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher and the burden of different causes of death and disability by age and sex for 195 countries and territories, 1990-2015. DESIGN: A comparative risk assessment of health loss related to SBP. Estimated distribution of SBP was based on 844 studies from 154 countries (published 1980-2015) of 8.69 million participants. Spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression was used to generate estimates of mean SBP and adjusted variance for each age, sex, country, and year. Diseases with sufficient evidence for a causal relationship with high SBP (eg, ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke) were included in the primary analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mean SBP level, cause-specific deaths, and health burden related to SBP (>/=110-115 mm Hg and also >/=140 mm Hg) by age, sex, country, and year. RESULTS: Between 1990-2015, the rate of SBP of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg increased from 73 119 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 67 949-78 241) to 81 373 (95% UI, 76 814-85 770) per 100 000, and SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher increased from 17 307 (95% UI, 17 117-17 492) to 20 526 (95% UI, 20 283-20 746) per 100 000. The estimated annual death rate per 100 000 associated with SBP of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg increased from 135.6 (95% UI, 122.4-148.1) to 145.2 (95% UI 130.3-159.9) and the rate for SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher increased from 97.9 (95% UI, 87.5-108.1) to 106.3 (95% UI, 94.6-118.1). For loss of DALYs associated with systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher, the loss increased from 95.9 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 87.0-104.9 million) to 143.0 million (95% UI, 130.2-157.0 million) [corrected], and for SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher, the loss increased from 5.2 million (95% UI, 4.6-5.7 million) to 7.8 million (95% UI, 7.0-8.7 million). The largest numbers of SBP-related deaths were caused by ischemic heart disease (4.9 million [95% UI, 4.0-5.7 million]; 54.5%), hemorrhagic stroke (2.0 million [95% UI, 1.6-2.3 million]; 58.3%), and ischemic stroke (1.5 million [95% UI, 1.2-1.8 million]; 50.0%). In 2015, China, India, Russia, Indonesia, and the United States accounted for more than half of the global DALYs related to SBP of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In international surveys, although there is uncertainty in some estimates, the rate of elevated SBP (>/=110-115 and >/=140 mm Hg) increased substantially between 1990 and 2015, and DALYs and deaths associated with elevated SBP also increased. Projections based on this sample suggest that in 2015, an estimated 3.5 billion adults had SBP of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg and 874 million adults had SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher.","Forouzanfar MH, Liu P, Roth GA, Ng M, Biryukov S, Marczak L, Alexander L, Estep K, Hassen Abate K, Akinyemiju TF, Ali R, Alvis-Guzman N, Azzopardi P, Banerjee A, Barnighausen T, Basu A, Bekele T, Bennett DA, Biadgilign S, Catala-Lopez F, Feigin VL, Fernandes JC, Fischer F, Gebru AA, Gona P, Gupta R, Hankey GJ, Jonas JB, Judd SE, Khang YH, Khosravi A, Kim YJ, Kimokoti RW, Kokubo Y, Kolte D, Lopez A, Lotufo PA, Malekzadeh R, Melaku YA, Mensah GA, Misganaw A, Mokdad AH, Moran AE, Nawaz H, Neal B, Ngalesoni FN, Ohkubo T, Pourmalek F, Rafay A, Rai RK, Rojas-Rueda D, Sampson UK, Santos IS, Sawhney M, Schutte AE, Sepanlou SG, Shifa GT, Shiue I, Tedla BA, Thrift AG, Tonelli M, Truelsen T, Tsilimparis N, Ukwaja KN, Uthman OA, Vasankari T, Venketasubramanian N, Vlassov VV, Vos T, Westerman R, Yan LL, Yano Y, Yonemoto N, Zaki ME, Murray CJ",JAMA,2017 Jan 10,Hypertension AND Indonesia
33533536,Applications of artificial intelligence for hypertension management.,"The prevalence of hypertension is increasing along with an aging population, causing millions of premature deaths annually worldwide. Low awareness of blood pressure (BP) elevation and suboptimal hypertension diagnosis serve as the major hurdles in effective hypertension management. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI), however, sheds the light of new strategies for hypertension management, such as remote supports from telemedicine and big data-derived prediction. There is considerable evidence demonstrating the feasibility of AI applications in hypertension management. A foreseeable trend was observed in integrating BP measurements with various wearable sensors and smartphones, so as to permit continuous and convenient monitoring. In the meantime, further investigations are advised to validate the novel prediction and prognostic tools. These revolutionary developments have made a stride toward the future model for digital management of chronic diseases.","Tsoi K, Yiu K, Lee H, Cheng HM, Wang TD, Tay JC, Teo BW, Turana Y, Soenarta AA, Sogunuru GP, Siddique S, Chia YC, Shin J, Chen CH, Wang JG, Kario K",J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich),2021 Mar,Hypertension AND Indonesia
37379565,"Prevalence, Awareness, Treatment, and Control of Hypertension Among Older Adults in the Philippines.","BACKGROUND: Little is known about the current prevalence and management of hypertension among older Filipinos. To address this gap, we examined the prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension, as well as their correlates, among older Filipinos. METHODS: We analyzed a nationally representative survey of Filipinos aged 60 years and older (N = 5 985) in the Philippines. Blood pressure (BP) measurements were taken using a digital BP apparatus. People with hypertension included those with a systolic BP >/= 140 mmHg or a diastolic BP >/= 90 mmHg, or those who reported current use of antihypertensive medication. People with undiagnosed hypertension were those who had measured hypertension but had not been diagnosed by a doctor as having hypertension, while people with untreated hypertension were those who had measured hypertension but not taking medication. Among those who were taking antihypertensive medication, respondents with measured hypertension were considered to have uncontrolled BP. RESULTS: Results showed that 69.1% of older Filipinos had hypertension, but only 61.6% of people with hypertension were aware of their hypertension and 51.5% were untreated. Sociodemographic factors, such as age, sex, education, and living arrangements, were significantly associated with hypertension prevalence, hypertension awareness, lack of treatment for hypertension, and/or suboptimal BP control. CONCLUSION: We observed a high prevalence of hypertension among older Filipinos and a relatively low level of awareness and treatment of hypertension among them. While there are government efforts to address the growing prevalence of hypertension in the country, more efforts should be made to bring these government programs to older Filipinos.","Abalos JB, Saito Y, Ramos MA Jr, Cruz GT",J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci,2024 Feb 1,Hypertension AND Indonesia
35795187,The Gut Microbiota (Microbiome) in Cardiovascular Disease and Its Therapeutic Regulation.,"In the last two decades, considerable interest has been shown in understanding the development of the gut microbiota and its internal and external effects on the intestine, as well as the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) such as metabolic syndrome. The intestinal microbiota plays a pivotal role in human health and disease. Recent studies revealed that the gut microbiota can affect the host body. CVDs are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and patients favor death over chronic kidney disease. For the function of gut microbiota in the host, molecules have to penetrate the intestinal epithelium or the surface cells of the host. Gut microbiota can utilize trimethylamine, N-oxide, short-chain fatty acids, and primary and secondary bile acid pathways. By affecting these living cells, the gut microbiota can cause heart failure, atherosclerosis, hypertension, myocardial fibrosis, myocardial infarction, and coronary artery disease. Previous studies of the gut microbiota and its relation to stroke pathogenesis and its consequences can provide new therapeutic prospects. This review highlights the interplay between the microbiota and its metabolites and addresses related interventions for the treatment of CVDs.","Rahman MM, Islam F, -Or-Rashid MH, Mamun AA, Rahaman MS, Islam MM, Meem AFK, Sutradhar PR, Mitra S, Mimi AA, Emran TB, Fatimawali, Idroes R, Tallei TE, Ahmed M, Cavalu S",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,2022,Hypertension AND Indonesia
39267069,Work hours and the risk of hypertension: the case of Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Individuals working excessive hours is a worldwide phenomenon. In Indonesia, over 32 million people work more than 40 h per week, contributing to around 26% of the workforce. Excessive working may affect health, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension. Hypertension affected around 34% of Indonesian adults, approximately 63.3 million people and led to about 427,000 deaths in 2018, and the prevalence remains high at 29.2% in 2023. This study aims to analyze the relationship between work hours and the risk of hypertension among working individuals in Indonesia. METHODS: This study used a pooled cross-sectional data from the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) wave 4 (2007) and wave 5 (2014) and performed a logit regression analysis to examine the likelihood of a working individual having hypertension based on the individual's work hours. A dummy variable of hypertension is created based on the result of blood pressure measurement. The sample consists of 22,500 working individuals in Indonesia. This study controlled for job characteristics, sociodemographic status and health-behavioral risk factors such as BMI and smoking behavior, and performed additional regression analyses for alternative models to check for robustness. RESULTS: Our findings showed that there is a higher probability of having hypertension for workers who work longer hours by 0.06% points for each additional hour of work (p < 0.01). Other factors such as physical activity and smoking behavior have also been demonstrated to be significantly correlated to the risk of hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a positive relationship between work hours and hypertension. Although this study cannot suggest causality, the strongly significant correlation may provide an idea and an overview regarding the risk of hypertension among working individuals in Indonesia. The Indonesian government could consider conducting further studies to implement and promote flexible working arrangements initiatives and incentive programs to improve workers' health outcomes.","Andini FAD, Siregar AYM",BMC Public Health,2024 Sep 12,Hypertension AND Indonesia

28550808,The Association between Height and Hypertension in Indonesia.,"There is growing interest in the influence of early-life conditions on the development of disease. Among diseases in adulthood, hypertension is particularly important for the developing world because considerably more people there are and will be afflicted with the disease than in the developed world and hypertensives there are often unaware of their disease status. We employed height as a proxy for the influence of early-life conditions and estimated the relation between height and hypertension status in Indonesia. We analysed 9,597 men and 10,143 women, aged 25-70. We employed a linear probability model to relate height to hypertension status by sex and age. When we controlled for an array of covariates, a 10cm increase in height was related to an approximately 7% point reduction in the likelihood of being hypertensive for both men and women. This is about a quarter of the prevalence of hypertension in Indonesia. This relation was linear and stronger among older individuals. In addition, the pre- and post-pubertal environments (measured by leg and trunk lengths, respectively) contributed similarly to hypertension. Further evidence suggests that women are more likely to be hypertensive at older ages because they are on average shorter than men.",Sohn K,Econ Hum Biol,2017 Nov,Hypertension AND Indonesia
36293846,District-Level Inequalities in Hypertension among Adults in Indonesia: A Cross-Sectional Analysis by Sex and Age Group.,"BACKGROUND: An estimated 1.28 billion adults 30-79 years old had hypertension globally in 2021, of which two-thirds lived in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Previous studies on geographic and socioeconomic inequalities in hypertension among adults have limitations: (a) most studies used individual-level data, while evidence from locality-level data is also crucial for policymaking; (b) studies from LMICs are limited. Thus, our study examines geographic and socioeconomic inequalities in hypertension among adults across districts in Indonesia. METHODS: We combined geospatial and quantitative analyses to assess the inequalities in hypertension across 514 districts in Indonesia. Hypertension data were obtained from the Indonesian Basic Health Survey (Riskesdas) 2018. Socioeconomic data were obtained from the World Bank. Six dependent variables included hypertension prevalence among all adults (18+ years), male adults, female adults, young adults (18-24 years), adults (25-59 years), and older adults (60+ years). RESULTS: We also found significant geographic and socioeconomic inequalities in hypertension among adults across 514 districts. All hypertension indicators were higher in the most developed region than in the least developed region. Districts in the Java region had up to 50% higher prevalence of hypertension among all adults, males, females, young adults, adults, and older adults. Notably, districts in the Kalimantan region had the highest prevalence of hypertension, even compared to those in Java. Moreover, income level was positively associated with hypertension; the wealthiest districts had higher hypertension than the poorest districts by up to 30%, but only among males and older adults were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: There were significant inequalities in hypertension among adults across 514 districts in the country. Policies to reduce such inequalities may need to prioritize more affluent urban areas and rural areas with a higher burden.","Oktamianti P, Kusuma D, Amir V, Tjandrarini DH, Paramita A",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2022 Oct 14,Hypertension AND Indonesia
38777393,Effectiveness of community-based diabetes and hypertension prevention and management programmes in Indonesia and Viet Nam: a quasi-experimental study.,"INTRODUCTION: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have surpassed infectious diseases as the leading global cause of death, with the Southeast Asian region experiencing a significant rise in NCD prevalence over the past decades. Despite the escalating burden, screening for NCDs remains at very low levels, resulting in undetected cases, premature mortality and high public healthcare costs. We investigate whether community-based NCD prevention and management programmes are an effective solution. METHODS: In Indonesia, we compare participants in the community-based NCD screening and management programme Pos Pembinaan Terpadu-Penyakit Tidak Menular with matched non-participants with respect to their uptake of screening activities, health-related behaviour and knowledge and metabolic risk factors. We use statistical matching to redress a possible selection bias (n=1669). In Viet Nam, we compare members of Intergenerational Self-Help Clubs, which were offered similar NCD health services, with members of other community groups, where such services were not offered. We can rely on two waves of data and use a double-difference approach to redress a possible selection bias and to measure the impacts of participation (n=1710). We discuss strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches in Indonesia and Viet Nam. RESULTS: In Indonesia, participants have significantly higher uptake of screening for hypertension and diabetes (+13% from a control mean of 88% (95% CI 9% to 17%); +93% from a control mean of 48% (95% CI 79% to 108%)). In both countries, participants show a higher knowledge about risk factors, symptoms and complications of NCDs (Indonesia: +0.29 SD (0.13-0.45), Viet Nam: +0.17 SD (0.03-0.30)). Yet, the improved knowledge is only partly reflected in improved health behaviour (Viet Nam: fruit consumption +0.33 SD (0.15-0.51), vegetable consumption +0.27 SD (0.04-0.50)), body mass index (BMI) (Viet Nam: BMI -0.07 SD (-0.13 to -0.00)) or metabolic risk factors (Indonesia: systolic blood pressure: -0.13 SD (-0.26 to -0.00)). CONCLUSION: Community-based NCD programmes are well suited to increase screening and to transmit health knowledge. Due to their extensive outreach within the community, they can serve as a valuable complement to the screening services provided at the primary healthcare level. Yet, limited coverage, insufficient resources and a high staff turnover remain a problem.

39280268,Enhancing adolescent hypertension prevention in Indonesia through interactive multimedia: Model development and validation.,"Adolescent hypertension is emerging as a significant health challenge. Peer-led interventions utilizing engaging multimedia platforms have demonstrated the potential to enhance prevention behaviors among adolescents. However, there remains a gap in the literature comparing the effectiveness of multimedia intervention with traditional lecture-based approach in adolescent hypertension prevention in Indonesia. The aim of this study was to compare the traditional lecture-based approach and interactive multimedia intervention (e-module, animated videos, and infographics) on adolescents' knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding adolescent hypertension prevention. A quasi-experimental study with pre-test and post-test control group study was conducted from June to December 2023 in two senior high schools in districts of Pedurungan and Kedungmundu, Semarang, Central Java, Indonesia. To prepare the multimedia model, the Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation (ADDIE) framework and mapping intervention approach were employed to ensure effective decision-making at each step. A total of 100 high school students were involved, with 50 assigned to the intervention group and 50 to the control group. The intervention group received a multimedia model from the peer educators, while the control group received a traditional PowerPoint-based presentation from the community healthcare workers. The hypertension prevention knowledge, attitude, and practice were assessed using validated questionnaires with 20, 15, and 15 items, respectively. This study found that, after model implementation, significant improvements were observed in students' knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding hypertension prevention (all had p<0.001). Specifically, knowledge scores increased by 4.78 points, attitude scores by 10.64 points, and practice scores by 2.9 points. This study highlights that multimedia interventions could significantly improve hypertension prevention behaviors among adolescents by enhancing their knowledge, attitudes, and practices through engaging and interactive multimedia materials.","Wijayati S, Sakundarno M, Surjoputro A, Budiyono B",Narra J,2024 Aug,Hypertension AND Indonesia
31465584,Socioeconomic inequalities in the utilisation of hypertension and type 2 diabetes management services in Indonesia.,"OBJECTIVES: To describe socioeconomic inequalities in the utilisation of hypertension and type 2 diabetes (T2D) management services in the Indonesian population and to determine whether education level and geographical location contribute to inequalities. METHODS: Cross-sectional study using data from the 2014 Indonesia Family Life Survey (N = 30 762 for hypertension; N = 6758 for T2D). Socioeconomic status was measured by household consumption. The prevalence of hypertension and T2D was determined using internationally standardised clinical measurement, while disease management was defined by participation in screening and current use of medication. The relative index of inequality (RII) was used to estimate inequalities, adjusted to education level and geographical location. RESULTS: For all household consumption quintiles, we observed low rates of screening participation for T2D and low medication use in both hypertension and T2D. We found socioeconomic inequalities in screening participation for hypertension (RII 2.68, 95% CI 2.42-2.96) and T2D (RII 7.30, 95% CI 5.48-9.72) and also for medication use in hypertension (RII 3.09, 95% CI 2.28-4.18) and T2D (RII 2.81, 95% CI 1.09-7.27). Education level contributed to socioeconomic inequalities in screening utilisation for both hypertension and T2D. Geographical location contributed to inequalities in screening utilisation and medication use for T2D. Socioeconomic inequalities in medication use for hypertension and T2D were larger among men than women. CONCLUSIONS: Large socioeconomic inequalities were found in the utilisation of hypertension and T2D management services in Indonesia. Improving affordability, availability and approachability of services is crucial to reduce such inequalities.","Mulyanto J, Kringos DS, Kunst AE",Trop Med Int Health,2019 Nov,Hypertension AND Indonesia
34602880,Differences Risk Factors for Hypertension Among Elderly Woman in Rural and Urban Indonesia.,"Introduction: Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. A high prevalence of hypertension is found in elderly women. Rural areas have different characteristics from urban areas. Therefore, it is necessary to identify risk factors for hypertension in rural and urban elderly women for optimal therapy management. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in rural (Banyuwangi district) and urban (Surabaya city) areas, East Java, Indonesia. The study was carried out in 2015-2016 in women aged >/=45 years, residing in an area for >/=10 years, and willing to collect urine for 24 hours. Respondents consisted of 54 older adults from rural areas and 51 older adults from urban areas who actively participate in the integrated healthcare center for the elderly. The independent t-test and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze the data. Results: The prevalence of hypertension in the rural area was 27.8% and in the urban area was 37.25%. The risk factors for hypertension in the urban area were urine sodium level (AOR=1.02, 95% CI=1.001-1.04, p-value=0.043), urine potassium level (AOR=0.88, 95% CI=0.78-0.999, p-value=0.022), and Body Mass Index (AOR=1.26, 95% CI=1.06-1.49, p-value=0.008). Meanwhile, the factor associated with hypertension in the rural area was age (AOR=1.08, 95% CI=1.003-1.16, p-value=0.042). Conclusion: The prevalence of hypertension in the urban area was higher than in the rural area. There were differences in risk factors for hypertension that occurred both in rural and urban areas. However, risk factors in both areas are equally important to overcome. Collaboration from multiple stakeholders and sectors is urgently needed, such as the Public Health Center, Integrated Assistance Post for Non-Communicable Diseases, and the local health office.","Astutik E, Farapti F, Tama TD, Puspikawati SI",Yale J Biol Med,2021 Sep,Hypertension AND Indonesia
33256570,The Effect of Educational Program on Hypertension Management Toward Knowledge and Attitude Among Uncontrolled Hypertension Patients in Rural Area of Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a major public health threat affecting adults worldwide. The low hypertension management knowledge causes uncontrolled high blood pressure and it's a complication. It requires patients with uncontrolled hypertension to increase adherence to either pharmacological therapy or nonpharmacological therapy aimed at achieving normal blood pressure. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a short-term educational program on hypertension management related knowledge and attitude among uncontrolled hypertension patients in Malang, Indonesia. METHODS: The research design used a Quasi-Experimental study with the design of one group pre-post-test. The participants were 41 uncontrolled hypertension patients chosen by purposive sampling at the Ciptomulyo Public Health Center. The questionnaires were used to collect the data. The Hypertension Knowledge-Level Scale (HK-LS) questionnaire was used to determine the knowledge of uncontrolled hypertension patients. KAP questionnaire was used to determine the attitude of the participants. The data were analyzed statistically using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. RESULTS: The majority of respondents were aged 55-65 (54%), female (83%), housewife (76%), graduated elementary school (71%), and long suffered from hypertension >1 year (68%). The result showed that the provision of the educational program increases knowledge (p = 0,000) and attitude (p = 0,008) of patients on the management of hypertension. CONCLUSION: Health education could improve hypertension management knowledge and attitude among uncontrolled hypertension in the rural area. Furthermore, Health providers should consider giving the education among uncontrolled hypertension.","Kurnia AD, Melizza N, Ruhyanudin F, Masruroh NL, Prasetyo YB, Setyowati CI, Khoirunnisa O",Community Health Equity Res Policy,2022 Jan,Hypertension AND Indonesia
36051316,Modifiable and Non-modifiable Factors Associated with Low Awareness of Hypertension Treatment in Indonesia: A Cross-Sectional Population-Based National Survey.,"INTRODUCTION: Low awareness about hypertension treatment is recognized as a significant cause of treatment failure. Therefore, identifying its underlying factors is essential for developing effective intervention strategies. This study aims to identify the modifiable and non-modifiable factors associated with low awareness about hypertension treatment. METHOD: This national, cross-sectional, population-based survey used publicly available data from the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS-5) for 2014 among respondents with hypertension aged >/=15 years. Depression and insomnia, as modifiable factors, were assessed using the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) and the Patient-Recorded Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) questionnaire, respectively. Non-modifiable factors, such as sociodemographic information, were obtained from self-reported data. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between these factors and low awareness about hypertension treatment. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. RESULT: The study recruited 7,920 respondents, the majority of whom were female (53.8%) and aged <60 years (71.1%). The prevalence of low awareness of hypertension treatment was 87.1% (51.8% in women and 48.2% in men). Being an elderly (OR: 1.60, 95%CI 1.36-1.88), being irregularly blood pressure control (OR: 4.40, 95% CI 3.78-5.13), having depressive symptoms (OR: 1.35, 95% CI 1.12-1.62), having insomnia (OR: 1.31, 95% CI 1.11-1.53), and having low satisfaction with health care (OR: 1.28, 95% CI 1.08-1.51) were associated with low awareness of hypertension treatment. Surprisingly, respondents with strong religiosity (OR: 1.62; 95% CI 1.25-2.09) were more likely to display low awareness of hypertension treatment. CONCLUSION: The main factors associated with low awareness of hypertension treatment are modifiable. Thus, health care professionals should integrate more patient-specific factors when designing tailored interventions.","Khoiry QA, Alfian SD, Abdulah R",Glob Heart,2022,Hypertension AND Indonesia

There are ethnic differences in diet, culture, and attitudes towards health screening, access to care, and treatment of chronic diseases. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) have rising incidence and prevalence due to increased affliction with non-communicable diseases of diabetes and hypertension. To prevent the expensive complications of ESKD, one of the most important risk factors to control is hypertension in patients with CKD. We performed a narrative review on the prevalence of CKD in patients with hypertension, the prevalence and control of hypertension in patients with CKD, and the dietary sodium intake in CKD populations.","Teo BW, Chan GC, Leo CCH, Tay JC, Chia YC, Siddique S, Turana Y, Chen CH, Cheng HM, Hoshide S, Minh HV, Sogunuru GP, Wang TD, Kario K",J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich),2021 Mar,Hypertension AND Indonesia
31935256,The implementation of community-based diabetes and hypertension management care program in Indonesia.,"Since 2010, Indonesian government has initiated a chronic disease management program, Prolanis (Program Pengendalian Penyakit Kronis) targeted for diabetes and hypertension. The program is continued at the commencement of universal health coverage (UHC) in 2014. ""This study aimed to report the utilization and cost of the implementation of Prolanis in Indonesia from 2014 to 2016, or two years since the commencement of Indonesian universal health coverage."" Secondary data analysis was performed using publicly available data and data obtained from the national health insurance agency (BPJS); while data on disease prevalence were collected from basic national health survey. There was an increase trend of Prolanis participants, from around 11,000 participants in 2014 to more than 250,000 in 2016. More than 70% of participants were adults living in Java, however, the acceptance rate was very low in other area. Across different activities in Prolanis, physical activity was the most participated ones. In comparison to other regions, regions in Java were the most active area. The total expenditure for Prolanis program in 2016 increased almost triple from the annual cost in 2014. However, the cost per person was actually decreased more than 50%. Within two years of UHC implementation, there were increase covered participants and total costs, but cost per individual was decreased and there was significant difference in of cost between Java and outside Java. Further study and routine monitoring-evaluation process by health authority is needed to assess whether the cost difference would affect the service quality.","Khoe LC, Wangge G, Soewondo P, Tahapary DL, Widyahening IS",PLoS One,2020,Hypertension AND Indonesia
34207848,Gender Differences in Prevalence and Risk Factors for Hypertension among Adult Populations: A Cross-Sectional Study in Indonesia.,"Although hypertension is among the main public health concerns in Indonesia, due to the scarcity of data, few studies have investigated the factors associated with hypertension in men and women. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of and factors associated with hypertension among adult men and women in Indonesia. The 2018 Survey of the Sleman Health Demographic and Surveillance System was utilized, consisting of 4328 individuals aged 18+ years. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the sociodemographic and health behavior factors of hypertension. Overall, the prevalence of hypertension was 40% (42% in men and 38% in women). Age, abdominal obesity and chronic non-communicable diseases were the common predictors of hypertension in men and women (p < 0.05). The odds ratio of hypertension among men with low education was lower than among those with high education (OR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.29-0.94). For women, being in the poorest socioeconomic condition increased the risk of hypertension by 1.67 times compared to the richest (95% CI: 1.21-2.32). Gender differences in the prevalence of and factors associated with hypertension were observed among adult populations in Sleman District, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Therefore, a gender-based approach in the health prevention strategy to control hypertension for men and women is needed.","Defianna SR, Santosa A, Probandari A, Dewi FST",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2021 Jun 9,Hypertension AND Indonesia
31131972,Hypertension and Dementia: A comprehensive review from the HOPE Asia Network.,"Approximately 365 million people in Asia were classified as elderly in 2017. This number is rising and expected to reach approximately 520 million by 2030. The risk of hypertension and cognitive impairment/dementia increases with age. Recent data also show that the prevalence of hypertension and age-related dementia are rising in Asian countries. Moreover, not many people in Asian countries are aware of the relationship between hypertension and cognitive impairment/dementia. Furthermore, hypertension control is poorer in Asia than in developed countries. Hypertension is known to be a major risk factor for damage to target organs, including the brain. Decreased cognitive function can indicate the presence of target organ damage in the brain. Twenty-four-hour blood pressure profiles and blood pressure variability have been associated with cognitive impairment and/or silent cerebral diseases, such as silent cerebral infarction or white matter lesions, which are predisposing conditions for cognitive impairment and dementia. Hypertension that occurs in midlife also affects the incidence of cognitive impairments in later life. Managing and controlling blood pressure could preserve cognitive functions, such as by reducing the risk of vascular dementia and by reducing the global burden of stroke, which also affects cognitive function.","Turana Y, Tengkawan J, Chia YC, Hoshide S, Shin J, Chen CH, Buranakitjaroen P, Nailes J, Park S, Siddique S, Sison J, Ann Soenarta A, Chin Tay J, Sogunuru GP, Zhang Y, Wang JG, Kario K",J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich),2019 Aug,Hypertension AND Indonesia
33370385,"Participation in community-based health care interventions (CBHIs) and its association with hypertension awareness, control and treatment in Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: Little attention has been paid to whether CBHIs improve awareness, treatment and control of hypertension in the contexts of low- and middle- income countries (LMICs). This study therefore aims to examine participation in CBHIs for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and its association with awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension among Indonesians. METHODS: This study used data from the 2014 Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS), drawn from 30,351 respondents aged 18 years and older. Participation in CBHIs was measured by respondents' participation in CBHIs for NCDs (Posbindu PTM and Posbindu Lansia) during the 12 months prior to the survey. Logistic regressions were used to identify the relationships between participation in CBHIs for NCDs and awareness, treatment, and control of blood pressure among respondents with hypertension. RESULTS: The age-adjusted prevalence of hypertension was 31.2% and 29.2% in urban and rural areas, respectively. The overall age-adjusted prevalence was 30.2%. Approximately 41.8% of respondents with hypertension were aware of their condition, and only 6.6% of respondents were receiving treatment. Participation in CBHIs for NCDs was associated with 50% higher odds of being aware and 118% higher odds of receiving treatment among adults with hypertension. There was no significant association between participation in CBHIs for NCDs and controlled hypertension. CONCLUSION: Our data emphasise the importance of CBHIs for NCDs to improve the awareness and treatment of hypertension in the Indonesian population.","Sujarwoto S, Maharani A",PLoS One,2020,Hypertension AND Indonesia
33527663,Disaster hypertension and cardiovascular events in disaster and COVID-19 pandemic.,"The incidence of large disasters has been increasing worldwide. This has led to a growing interest in disaster medicine. In this review, we report current evidence related to disasters and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, such as cardiovascular diseases during disasters, management of disaster hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases associated with COVID-19. This review summarizes the time course and mechanisms of disaster-related diseases. It also discusses the use of information and communication technology (ICT) as a cardiovascular risk management strategy to prevent cardiovascular events. During the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, we used the ""Disaster Cardiovascular Prevention"" system that was employed for blood pressure (BP) monitoring and risk management using ICT. We introduced an ICT-based BP monitoring device at evacuation centers and shared patients' BP values in the database to support BP management by remote monitoring, which led to improved BP control. Effective use of telemedicine using ICT is important for risk management of cardiovascular diseases during disasters and pandemics in the future.","Narita K, Hoshide S, Tsoi K, Siddique S, Shin J, Chia YC, Tay JC, Teo BW, Turana Y, Chen CH, Cheng HM, Sogunuru GP, Wang TD, Wang JG, Kario K",J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich),2021 Mar,Hypertension AND Indonesia
32264836,The COngenital HeARt Disease in adult and Pulmonary Hypertension (COHARD-PH) registry: a descriptive study from single-center hospital registry of adult congenital heart disease and pulmonary hypertension in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUNDS: The COngenital HeARt Disease in adult and Pulmonary Hypertension (COHARD-PH) registry is the first registry for congenital heart disease (CHD) and CHD-related pulmonary hypertension (PH) in adults in Indonesia. The study aims to describe the demographics, clinical presentation, and hemodynamics data of adult CHD and CHD-related PH in Indonesia. METHODS: The COHARD-PH registry is a hospital-based, single-center, and prospective registry which includes adult patients with CHD and CHD-related PH. The patients were enrolled consecutively. For this study, we evaluated the registry patients from July 2012 until July 2019. The enrolled patients underwent clinical examination, electrocardiography, chest x-ray, 6-min walking test, laboratory measurement, and transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography. Right heart catheterization was performed to measure hemodynamics and confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH). RESULTS: We registered 1012 patients during the study. The majority were young, adult females. The majority of CHD was secundum ASD (73.4%). The main symptom was dyspnea on effort. The majority of patients (77.1%) had already developed signs of PH assessed by echocardiography. The Eisenmenger syndrome was encountered in 18.7% of the patients. Based on the right heart catheterization, 66.9% of patients had developed PAH. Patients with PAH were significantly older, had lower peripheral oxygen saturation, had lower 6-min walking distance, and higher NTproBNP. The NTproBNP level independently predicted the development of PAH among CHD. CONCLUSIONS: The COHARD-PH registry is the first Indonesian adult-CHD and CHD-related PH registry. The demographics, clinical presentation, and hemodynamics dataof this registry reflect the situation in developing countries which needs to be compared with similar registries from developed countries.","Dinarti LK, Hartopo AB, Kusuma AD, Satwiko MG, Hadwiono MR, Pradana AD, Anggrahini DW",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,2020 Apr 7,Hypertension AND Indonesia
31773883,Diversity of and initiatives for hypertension management in Asia-Why we need the HOPE Asia Network.,"The Hypertension Cardiovascular Outcome Prevention and Evidence in Asia (HOPE Asia) Network was set up to improve the management of hypertension in Asia with the ultimate goal of achieving ""zero"" cardiovascular events. Asia is a diverse continent, and the prevalence of hypertension has increased over the last 30 years. There are a number of Asia-specific features of hypertension and hypertension-related cardiovascular complications, which means that a region-specific approach is needed. White-coat hypertension will become more of an issue over time as Asian populations age, and masked hypertension is more prevalent in Asian than in Western countries. Identifying and treating masked hypertension is important to reduce cardiovascular risk. Abnormal patterns of blood pressure (BP) variability common in Asia include exaggerated early morning BP surge and nocturnal hypertension. These are also important cardiovascular risk factors that need to be managed. Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) is an important tool for detecting white-coat and masked hypertension, and monitoring BP variability, and practices in Asia are variable. Use of HBPM is important given the Asia-specific features of hypertension, and strategies are needed to improve and standardize HBPM usage. Development of HBPM devices capable of measuring nocturnal BP along with other information and communication technology-based strategies are key developments in the widespread implementation of anticipation medicine strategies to detect and prevent cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension. Region-wide differences in hypertension prevalence, control, and management practices in Asia highlight the importance of information sharing to facilitate best practices.","Kario K, Chia YC, Sukonthasarn A, Turana Y, Shin J, Chen CH, Buranakitjaroen P, Nailes J, Hoshide S, Siddique S, Sison J, Soenarta AA, Sogunuru GP, Tay JC, Teo BW, Zhang YQ, Park S, Minh HV, Tomitani N, Kabutoya T, Verma N, Wang TD, Wang JG",J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich),2020 Mar,Hypertension AND Indonesia
39602401,Identifying relevant diabetes and hypertension control management guidelines in primary healthcare and community settings in Indonesia: A Delphi survey.,"The burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Indonesia is increasing, as evidenced by the latest Indonesian National Health Research, which shows an increase in diabetes prevalence, from 6.9% in 2013 to 10.9% in 2018, and hypertension, from 25.8% in 2013 to 34.1% in 2018. Hence, effective actions in community and primary health care (PHC) facility settings are necessary to tackle the burden of diabetes and hypertension, especially in low- and middle-income countries. The Indonesian government has issued numerous guidelines regarding NCDs. However, not all these guidelines can be applied to communities or PHCs. This study aimed to identify priority guidelines to support the community and PHC for NCD management using the Delphi survey method. These prioritized guidelines will serve as valuable resources for developing relevant, operational and comprehensive modules for community cadres and PHC staff involved in NCD management. The Delphi survey involved 25 experts and comprised three rounds using a questionnaire: 1) identification and assessment of guidelines, 2) assessment of the importance of guidelines, and 3) nomination of the three main priority guidelines. The results revealed three priority guidelines: NCD management guidelines, technical guidelines for Pos Pembinaan Terpadu (POSBINDU) NCDs, and integrated services for NCDs in PHC facilities. Additionally, priority guidelines were used to develop operational modules for community cadres and PHC staff in NCDs management. In conclusion, utilizing the Delphi method serves as a scientific approach to identify priority guidelines crucial for supporting the community and PHC in managing NCDs, particularly in countries with contexts similar to Indonesia.","Pamungkasari EP, Balgis B, Koot J, Landsman J, Pardoel Z, Rusnak M, Plancikova D, Sari V, Putra SE, Hafizhan M, Ahmad KF, Pangesti L, Wibowo IS, Probandari A",PLoS One,2024,Hypertension AND Indonesia

The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the dose-response association between the TyG index and the incidence of hypertension. An extensive search was conducted through several databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, and Scopus, until June 1, 2024. The TyG index was used as the exposure, and the incidence of hypertension was measured throughout the TyG index intervals. The effect estimates were presented as odds ratios (OR) in both the unadjusted and adjusted models. Adjusted OR were carried out from all included studies to eliminate the possibility of confounding factors being involved in the incidence of hypertension. A total of 108.936 participants (mean age: 48.2 years old, male: 47%, mean body mass index: 23.9 kg/m2) from 14 observational studies were included. The TyG index in the most eminent category was related to a higher risk of hypertension in both unadjusted (OR: 2.59, 95%CI: 2.03-3.31, p<0.001; I2: 97.1%, p<0.001) and adjusted model (OR: 1.74, 95%CI: 1.39-2.19, p<0.001; I2: 92.2%, p<0.001). The dose-response meta-analysis for the adjusted OR showed that the linear association analysis was not significant per 0.1 increase in the TyG index. The dose-response curve became increasingly steeper at the TyG index above 8.5. In conclusion, the TyG index was shown to be strongly linked with hypertension in a non-linear dose-response manner.","Lukito AA, Kamarullah W, Huang I, Pranata R",Narra J,2024 Aug,Hypertension AND Indonesia

STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: A review of English articles was performed between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2021, using the following databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. Studies that measure the prevalence and risk factors of hypertension among adult cotton textile workers in LMICs were included. Extraction of articles and quality assessment of included studies were performed independently by two authors using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool checklist. RESULTS: Of 2476 titles screened after duplication, 50 studies were shortlisted for full-text review, and a total of 10 studies were included. Of those 10 studies, seven were carried out in India, one in Indonesia, Iraq, and Iran. Using Stata version 6, the pooled prevalence of hypertension among the cotton textile workers was 18.0% (95% confidence interval: 11.0-25.0, random effect model: I(2) = 97.12%). Classic risk factors, including age, family history of hypertension, alcohol consumption, body mass index, and high waist-to-hip ratio, were recounted, whereas peculiar to the settings, noise level, improper use of earplugs, duration of noise exposure, working duration, and working in weaving section were reported. CONCLUSION: The limited available evidence indicates a significant prevalence of hypertension among cotton workers in LMICs.

However, hypertension awareness, treatment, and control are relativity poor. A community-based program to screen and educate people on non-communicable disease prevention (POSBINDU) was launched by the Indonesian government. However, the association between participation in the POSBINDU program with increasing knowledge, attitude, and practice of hypertension has not been widely assessed. In this study, we compared the knowledge, attitudes, and practices among people who accessed the POSBINDU and those who did not access the POSBINDU program. Subsequently, factors associated with the knowledge, attitudes, and practices among people who accessed the POSBINDU and those who did not access the POSBINDU were explored. METHODS: This was an observational study with a cross-sectional design measuring the knowledge, attitudes, and practices for hypertension control in four districts in Indonesia from October 2019 to January 2020. A total of 1,988 respondents were included in this study. A questionnaire was used to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of hypertension. Simple logistic regression was used to investigate the correlation between the characteristics of respondents and knowledge, attitudes, and practice status. Multiple logistic regression tests were conducted to investigate factors associated with knowledge, attitudes, and practice status. RESULTS: We found that people who accessed POSBINDU had higher odds of having better knowledge (aOR:1.4; 95%CI:1.2-1.8), however, accessed to POSBINDU was associated with lower attitudes (aOR:0.6; 85%CI: 0.5-0.7) and had no association with hypertension-related practice. CONCLUSION: People who accessed POSBINDU have an association with good knowledge, but the association with good attitude and practice was less clear. Therefore, an improvement in the POSBINDU program is needed to increase the attitudes and practices of hypertension.","Mashuri YA, Widyaningsih V, Premanawasti A, Koot J, Pardoel Z, Landsman-Dijkstra J, Postma M, Probandari A",PLoS One,2024,Hypertension AND Indonesia
28143994,Intra-uterine Growth Retardation and Development of Hypertension.,"Low birth weight (LBW) is defined as a birth weight of a liveborn infant of <2,500 gram. In developed countries, LBW is commonly caused by preterm birth; while in developing countries, it is mostly due to intrauterine growth retardation. The concept of developmental origins of adult diseases, particularly on late-onset diseases such as hypertension and kidney disease, implies that there is a correlation between intrauterine milieu, intrauterine growth retardation, premature birth and infant feeding. The 'fetal origin hypothesis' suggests that metabolic diseases are directly related to poor nutritional status in early life.There is an inverse association between LBW and later risk of hypertension. The pathomechanism that links LBW and hypertension is multifactorial including delayed nephrogenesis, genetic factors, sympathetic hyperactivity, endothel dysfunction, elastin deficiencies, insulin resistance and activation of renin-angiotension system.","Rasyid H, Bakri S",Acta Med Indones,2016 Oct,Hypertension AND Indonesia

37928804,Prevalence and determinants of obesity among individuals with diabetes in Indonesia.,"Background: Obesity and diabetes mellitus (DM), both individually or simultaneously, increase the risk of morbidity and mortality. The present study aimed to determine the prevalence and determinants of obesity among diabetic individuals in Indonesia. Methods: Data were extracted based on 2018 Indonesian Basic Health Survey (Riset Kesehatan Dasar=RISKESDAS). This study involved all individuals with DM and categorized obesity based on body mass index. After data clearing, this study analyzed 3911 DM subjects of the 33.905 subjects acquired from the 2018 RISKESDAS. The study also observed demographic data, diabetes control parameters, history of hypertension, lipid profiles, and food consumption patterns. These variables were involved in a Chi-square test, and related variables were then involved in the Binary logistic regression to define the independent determinants of obesity among DM subjects. Results: Of the 3911 DM subjects included, the study found an obesity prevalence of 32.9%. This study found that female (prevalence odds ratio [POR]=2.15; 95% CI: 1.76-2.62), age 15-44 years (POR=2.46; 95% CI: 1.83-3.33), urban residence (POR=1.49; 95% CI: 1.25-1.77), history of hypertension (POR=1.25; 95% CI: 1.04-1.51), high diastolic blood pressure (POR=1.90; 95% CI: 1.58-2.29), high LDL (POR=1.44; 95% CI: 1.13-1.84), high HDL (POR=0.60; 95% CI: 0.46-0.78, and high triglycerides (POR=1.27; 95% CI: 1.07-1.50) were the risk factor of obesity  among DM subjects; while higher education (POR=0.64; 95% CI: 0.53-0.78) and married (POR=0.73; 95% CI: 0.59-0.90) were protective factors of obesity among DM subjects. Conclusions: The study concluded that almost one-third of DM subjects in Indonesia were obese. Female, age, urban residence, education level, history of hypertension, diastolic blood pressure, and lipid profiles were all associated with obesity among DM subjects in Indonesia. These findings suggest that monitoring and controlling of related determinants is needed to prevent complications caused by the doubled burden of diabetes and obesity.","Azam M, Sakinah LF, Kartasurya MI, Fibriana AI, Minuljo TT, Aljunid SM",F1000Res,2022,Hypertension AND Indonesia
35818657,National Consensus on Portal Hypertension Management in Indonesia.,"Portal hypertension is a clinical syndrome that consists of hypersplenism, ascites, gastroesophageal varices, and encephalopathy. This condition is marked by increased portal pressure gradient and may occur with or without liver cirrhosis. To date, portal hypertension remains as the leading cause of severe complications and death of a patient with chronic liver disease, especially liver cirrhosis. Therefore, thorough understanding about management of portal hypertension is strongly required, especially considering that many complications of portal hypertension require early diagnosis and treatment to improve the prognosis of the patients. Additionally, although hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement has become a gold standard procedure for measuring portal pressure in the last twenty years, utilization of this method in Indonesia has been hindered by reluctance of the patients due to its invasiveness, high cost, and limited availability. This consensus is developed with evidence-based medicine principles to provide a guideline for portal hypertension management for general practitioners, specialists, and consultants, to achieve better clinical outcomes of portal hypertension in Indonesia.

39472546,Role of dietary potassium and salt substitution in the prevention and management of hypertension.,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) continue to be the leading cause of deaths and disability worldwide and the major contributor is hypertension. Despite all the improvements in detecting hypertension together with technological advances and affordable, efficacious and relatively free of adverse effects anti-hypertensive agents, we continue to struggle to prevent the onset of hypertension and to control blood pressure (BP) to acceptable targets. The poor control of hypertension is commonly due to non-adherence to medications. Another reason is the failure to adopt diet and lifestyle changes. Reduction of dietary salt intake is important for lowering BP but the role of potassium intake is also important. Globally the intake of sodium is double that of the recommended 2 gm per day (equivalent to 5 gm of sodium chloride/salt) and half that of the daily recommended intake of potassium of 3500 mg/day, giving a sodium-to-potassium ratio of >1, when ideally it should be <1. Many studies have shown that a higher potassium intake is associated with lower BPs, particularly when coupled concurrently with a lower sodium intake giving a lower sodium to potassium ratio. Most hypertension guidelines, while recommending reduction of salt intake to a set target, do not specifically recommend a target for potassium intake nor potassium supplementation. Here we review the role of potassium and salt substitution with potassium in the management of hypertension. Hence, the focus of dietary changes to lower BP and improve BP control should not be on reduction of salt intake alone but more importantly should include an increase in potassium intake.","Chia YC, He FJ, Cheng MH, Shin J, Cheng HM, Sukonthasarn A, Wang TD, Van Huynh M, Buranakitjaroen P, Sison J, Siddique S, Turana Y, Verma N, Tay JC, Schlaich MP, Wang JG, Kario K",Hypertens Res,2025 Jan,Hypertension AND Indonesia
38352217,"Associations between food consumption/dietary habits and the risks of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension: a cross-sectional study in Jakarta, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the current mean daily intake of 10 food groups, analyze the sociodemographic factors associated with food consumption, and determine the associations between food consumption/dietary intake and the prevalence rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and hypertension (HTN) in Jakarta, Indonesia. SUBJECTS/METHODS: A total of 600 participants aged 20-85 yrs were included in this cross-sectional study. Food consumption and dietary habits were assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. To determine the association between food consumption/dietary habits and the abovementioned diseases, logistic regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: The average vegetable and fruit intake was lower, while sugar and salt consumption were higher than that recommended by Indonesia's national dietary guidelines. A high intake of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) was associated with young age, men, ""single"" status, a high education level, and employment with a high monthly income. Obesity and T2D were positively correlated with high intakes of cereals and tubers, UPFs, sugars, fats, and oils. Conversely, an inverse association was found between legume, vegetable, and fruit consumption and obesity risk. An inverse correlation was also observed between vegetable consumption and T2D risk. Moreover, a high salt intake was inversely correlated with fruit consumption in terms of HTN risk. Non-indulgence in habitual late-night snacking and refrainment from consuming more than one dish at each meal were also negatively related to the prevalence of obesity, T2D, and HTN. Inverse correlations were also observed between the prevalence rates of T2D and HTN and abstaining from adding sugar to beverages. CONCLUSION: Foods high in fat, sugar, and sodium were strongly associated with the risks of obesity, T2D, and HTN. Additionally, poor eating habits were also associated with disease development.","Sakir NAI, Hwang SB, Park HJ, Lee BH",Nutr Res Pract,2024 Feb,Hypertension AND Indonesia
36958771,Prevalence and associated factors for prehypertension and hypertension among Indonesian adolescents: a cross-sectional community survey.,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence and determine the associated factors for developing prehypertension and hypertension among Indonesian adolescents. DESIGN: National cross-sectional study. SETTING: This study was conducted in all the provinces in Indonesia. PARTICIPANTS: The population in this study were all household members in Basic Health Research 2013 aged 15-19 years. The sample was all members of the 2013 Riskesdas household aged 15-19 years with the criteria of not having physical and mental disabilities, and having complete data. The number of samples analysed was 2735, comprising men (n=1319) and women (n=1416). MAIN OUTCOME: Dependent variables were prehypertension and hypertension in adolescents based on blood pressure measurements. RESULTS: The results of the analysis showed that the prevalence of prehypertension in adolescents was 16.8% and hypertension was 2.6%. In all adolescents, the risk factors for prehypertension were boys (adjusted OR, aOR 1.48; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.97), 18 years old (aOR 14.64; 95% CI 9.39 to 22.80), and 19 years old (aOR 19.89; 95% CI 12.41 to 31.88), and obese (aOR 2.16; 95% CI 1.02 to 4.58). Risk factors for hypertension in all adolescents included the age of 18 years old (aOR 3.06; 95% CI 1.28 to 7.34) and 19 years (aOR 3.25; 95% CI 1.25 to 8.41) and obesity (aOR 5.69; 95% CI 2.20 to 14.8). In adolescent girls, the chance of developing prehypertension increased with increasing age and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Several risk factors for hypertension in adolescent boys were age, central obesity and LDL cholesterol levels. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the trend of prehypertension in adolescents has appeared, besides hypertension. There are distinct patterns of factors that influence it in adolescent girls and boys, which can be useful to sharpen of planning and implementing health programmes.","Sudikno S, Mubasyiroh R, Rachmalina R, Arfines PP, Puspita T",BMJ Open,2023 Mar 23,Hypertension AND Indonesia

Hypertension guidelines across the world have recently been updated following the new and controversial lower blood pressure threshold of >/=130/80 mmHg for the diagnosis of hypertension adopted by the Americans. While there are differences between the major as well as between the Asian national guidelines, there were also many similarities.

35162176,"Determinants of Hypertension amongst Rice Farmers in West Java, Indonesia.","The hypertension rate in Indonesia has increased significantly in the past five years, but there is limited information about the hypertension risk of farmers. Our study assesses the prevalence of hypertension in this population and examines the proportional risk of various work environment and lifestyle factors among farmers. A cross-sectional study was conducted in high and low heat stress agriculture areas of West Java, Indonesia. There were 354 male farmers aged 25 to 73 years old who participated in the study. We measured blood pressure and used a questionnaire on self-reported use of anti-hypertension drugs or diagnosis by a medical professional to define hypertension. We assessed occupational factors including farming methods, heat stress and pesticide use, and personal factors including obesity, food intake, smoking status, alcohol consumption. Multivariate analysis was used to evaluate factors potentially associated with prevalence of hypertension. Forty-six percent of farmers experience hypertension. Farming in a location with higher heat stress (WBGT) was significantly associated with increased risk of hypertension (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01, 1.95). Farmers who used pesticide sprayers had an increased risk of hypertension (aPR 1.90, 95% CI 0.93, 3.87). No personal/lifestyle characteristics were significantly associated with hypertension, although ever smoking and ever consuming alcohol had an increased prevalence of hypertension. This study shows the importance of work environmental factors in the prevalence of hypertension and the necessity of public health education, identification and treatment of this ""silent killer"" among Indonesian farmers.","Prihartono NA, Fitria L, Ramdhan DH, Fitriyani F, Fauzia S, Woskie S",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2022 Jan 20,Hypertension AND Indonesia

33314715,Hypertension and erectile dysfunction: The role of endovascular therapy in Asia.,"The prevalence of erectile dysfunction (ED) is above 40% in both Asian and non-Asian male populations after the age of 40 years. The prevalence of ED among hypertensive patients is approximately double than that in normotensive population. Pelvic arterial insufficiency is the predominant cause of ED in men aged over 50 years. Stenosis in any segment of the iliac-pudendal-penile arterial system, which is considered an erectile-related arterial axis, could lead to ED. Pharmacotherapy with lifestyle modification is effective in alleviating sexual dysfunction, yet a substantial number of patients still develop ED. Given the established applicability of angioplasty for the entire iliac-pudendal-penile arterial system, penile duplex ultrasound, and pelvic computed tomography angiography could be considered as the routine screening tools in ED patients with poor response to phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. Endovascular therapy for pelvic arterial insufficiency-related ED has been shown to be a safe and effective treatment option in patients who have anatomically suitable vessels and functionally significant stenoses. Clinical improvement was achieved in over 60% of patients at one year following pelvic angioplasty in the PERFECT registry from Taiwan. A 30%-40% restenosis rate in distal internal pudendal and penile arteries remains a hurdle. Angioplasty for pelvic arterial occlusive disease could be considered as a viable approach to arteriogenic ED.","Wang TD, Lee CK, Chia YC, Tsoi K, Buranakitjaroen P, Chen CH, Cheng HM, Tay JC, Teo BW, Turana Y, Sogunuru GP, Wang JG, Kario K",J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich),2021 Mar,Hypertension AND Indonesia

Methods Data were acquired from 384 people living in eight rural villages via a researcher-administered questionnaire, a validated adherence scale, and a standardized hypertension knowledge survey. Multivariate analysis was used to identify the predictors of adherence and knowledge. Results Fifty-nine (15%) participants had good hypertension knowledge (score >/= 8 out of 10). Compared to participants with poor knowledge, these participants had higher formal education (odds ratio = 2.7, 95% confidence interval = 1.5-4.7), and lived closer to a community health center (odds ratio = 1.8, 95% confidence interval = 1.0-3.3). Knowledge gaps about the need for long-term medication, hypertension complications, and the target blood pressure were identified. Good hypertension knowledge predicted good adherence to medication (odds ratio = 7.1, 95% confidence interval = 3.3-15.2). Only 42 (11%) participants were considered to have good adherence. Reasons for intentional nonadherence were beliefs that medicines should be taken only when symptoms are evident, limited access to healthcare services, and a preference using traditional medicines. Conclusion Strategies for addressing knowledge gaps and misconceptions about hypertension medication are needed, particularly for people with a low educational level and those living some distances from healthcare facilities.","Rahmawati R, Bajorek B",Chronic Illn,2018 Sep,Hypertension AND Indonesia
30739534,"Impact of Coming Demographic Changes on the Number of Adults in Need of Care for Hypertension in Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and South Africa.","Over the coming decades, middle-income countries are expected to undergo substantial demographic changes. We estimated the consequences of these changes on the number of adults in need of hypertension care between 2015 and 2050 using nationally representative household-survey data collected in Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and South Africa (N=770 121). To reflect unmet need for healthcare, we defined hypertension as systolic blood pressure >/=140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure >/=90 mm Hg regardless of treatment status. Using a mathematical disease projection equation, we calculated the change in the number of individuals in need of hypertension care in each country that was due to changes in population size, age composition, and age-specific prevalence under various epidemiological scenarios. If the current age-specific prevalence schedule of hypertension remains unchanged until 2050, demographic changes alone will increase the number of adults in need of hypertension care by 319.7 million individuals, ranging from a relative growth of 55% in China to 151% in Mexico. Even if the age-specific prevalence of hypertension is reduced by 25% by 2050 among adults aged >/=40 years, the number of individuals in need of hypertension care will still increase by 145.9 million individuals, with relative increases ranging from 16% in China to 88% in Mexico. Overall, our results suggest that coming demographic changes in middle-income countries will overpower even ideal prevention efforts. Middle-income countries will need to massively expand healthcare services for aging-related diseases, such as hypertension, if they are to meet the virtually inevitable future increase in care needs for these conditions.","Sudharsanan N, Geldsetzer P",Hypertension,2019 Apr,Hypertension AND Indonesia
31851429,The influence of the ambient temperature on blood pressure and how it will affect the epidemiology of hypertension in Asia.,"Epidemiologic studies have consistently demonstrated an increased risk of cardiovascular disease during colder temperatures. Hemodynamic changes associated with cold temperature and an increase in thrombogenicity may both account for the increase in cardiovascular risk and mortality. Studies using both in-office and out-of-office BP measurements have consistently shown an elevation in BP during the colder seasons. The large difference in BP between cold and warm months may increase the incidence of hypertension and reduce the hypertension control rate, potentially resulting in increased cardiovascular risk, especially among those at risk of cardiovascular disease. The current trends in global warming and climate change may have a profound impact on the epidemiology of hypertension and cardiovascular disease, as changes in the climate may significantly affect both BP variability and cardiovascular disease, especially in those with high cardiovascular risk and the elderly. Furthermore, climate change could have a significant influence on hypertension in Asia, considering the unique characteristics of hypertensive patients in Asia. As an increase in ambient temperature decreases the mean daytime average and morning surge in BP, but increases the nocturnal BP, it is difficult to predict how environmental changes will affect the epidemiology and prognosis of hypertension in the Asian-Pacific region. However, these seasonal variations in BP could be minimized by adjusting the housing conditions and using anticipation medicine. In this review, we discuss the impact of seasonal variation in the ambient temperature on hypertension and cardiovascular disease and discuss how this may impact the epidemiology of hypertension and cardiovascular disease.","Park S, Kario K, Chia YC, Turana Y, Chen CH, Buranakitjaroen P, Nailes J, Hoshide S, Siddique S, Sison J, Soenarta AA, Sogunuru GP, Tay JC, Teo BW, Zhang YQ, Shin J, Van Minh H, Tomitani N, Kabutoya T, Sukonthasarn A, Verma N, Wang TD, Wang JG",J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich),2020 Mar,Hypertension AND Indonesia
27556532,"Prevalence, Awareness, Treatment and Control of Hypertension in Indonesian Adults Aged >/=40 Years: Findings from the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS).","OBJECTIVE: Hypertension is the major driver of the cardiovascular epidemic facing Indonesia in the 21st century. Understanding the socioeconomic inequalities associated with hypertension is essential for designing effective intervention strategies. The aim of the current study was to use sub-nationally representative survey data to examine socio-demographic inequalities in the prevalence, diagnosis and management of hypertension in Indonesian adults. METHODS: We investigated factors associated with hypertension prevalence, diagnosis, treatment and control using data on self-reported diagnosis and treatment, and blood pressure measurements, collected from 9755 respondents aged 40 years and up in the 2007 Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS 4). RESULTS: Age-standardized prevalence of hypertension among the study participants was 47.8% (95% CI: 46.8, 48.9), of which almost 70% were undiagnosed. Hypertension was significantly higher in women than men (52.3% versus 43.1%, p-value<0.001). Prevalence of hypertension increased significantly with ageing (Pfor trend <0.001). Over 91% (men: 92.1%, women: 90.0%) of hypertension cases were uncontrolled. Gender, education and socioeconomic status had differential impact on the diagnosis of hypertension and in receiving treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, less than a third were aware of their hypertension and a quarter of those on medication had their blood pressure effectively controlled. Men and those of younger age were more vulnerable to have undiagnosed and untreated hypertension. Substantial effort should be given to improve awareness about the condition and making provision for early diagnosis and treatment.","Hussain MA, Mamun AA, Reid C, Huxley RR",PLoS One,2016,Hypertension AND Indonesia

We aim to describe trends in the MMR and causes of maternal deaths in Indonesia over the past decades, regionally and nationally. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and conducted a search using PubMed, Embase, Global Health, CINAHL, Cochrane, Portal Garuda, and Google Scholar from the inception of the database to April 2023. We included all studies on the incidence and/or the causes of maternal deaths in Indonesia. The MMR was defined as the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. Maternal death causes were assessed and reclassified according to the WHO International Classification of Disease Maternal Mortality (ICD-MM). RESULTS: We included 63 studies that reported the MMR (54 studies) and/or the causes of maternal deaths (44 studies) in Indonesia from 1970 to 2022, with a total of 254,796 maternal deaths. The national MMR declined from 450 to 249 (45%) between 1990 and 2020. Great differences in MMR exist across the country, with the lowest in Java-Bali and the highest (more than twice the national MMR) in Sulawesi and Eastern Indonesia. Between 1990 and 2022, the proportion of deaths due to hemorrhage and sepsis decreased, respectively from 48 to 18% and 15-5%, while the share of deaths due to hypertensive disorders and non-obstetric causes increased, respectively from 8 to 19% and 10-49%. CONCLUSION: Despite the steady decline of maternal deaths in Indonesia, it remains one of the highest in Southeast Asia, with enormous disparities within the country. Hypertensive disorders and non-communicable diseases make up a growing share of maternal deaths, making maternal death reduction strategies increasingly challenging. National Maternal Death Surveillance and Response needs to be prioritized to eliminate preventable maternal deaths in Indonesia.

34686171,"Core health-components, contextual factors and program elements of community-based interventions in Southeast Asia - a realist synthesis regarding hypertension and diabetes.","BACKGROUND: In Southeast Asia, diabetes and hypertension are on the rise and have become major causes of death. Community-based interventions can achieve the required behavioural change for better prevention. The aims of this review are 1) to assess the core health-components of community-based interventions and 2) to assess which contextual factors and program elements affect their impact in Southeast Asia. METHODS: A realist review was conducted, combining empirical evidence with theoretical understanding. Documents published between 2009 and 2019 were systematically searched in PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar and PsycINFO and local databases. Documents were included if they reported on community-based interventions aimed at hypertension and/or diabetes in Southeast Asian context; and had a health-related outcome; and/or described contextual factors and/or program elements. RESULTS: We retrieved 67 scientific documents and 12 grey literature documents. We identified twelve core health-components: community health workers, family support, educational activities, comprehensive programs, physical exercise, telehealth, peer support, empowerment, activities to achieve self-efficacy, lifestyle advice, activities aimed at establishing trust, and storytelling. In addition, we found ten contextual factors and program elements that may affect the impact: implementation problems, organized in groups, cultural sensitivity, synergy, access, family health/worker support, gender, involvement of stakeholders, and referral and education services when giving lifestyle advice. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a considerable number of core health-components, contextual influences and program elements of community-based interventions to improve diabetes and hypertension prevention. The main innovative outcomes were, that telehealth can substitute primary healthcare in rural areas, storytelling is a useful context-adaptable component, and comprehensive interventions can improve health-related outcomes.

These factors were applied to predict the reality of systolic and diastolic decrease using the machine learning algorithm Naive Bayes, artificial neural network, logistic regression, and decision tree. RECENT FINDINGS: The increase in blood pressure, both systolic and diastolic, is very harmful to the health because uncontrolled high systolic and diastolic blood pressure can cause various diseases such as congestive heart failure, kidney failure, and cardiovascular disease. There have been many studies examining the factors that influence the occurrence of hypertension, but few studies have used machine learning to predict hypertension. The machine learning models performed well and can be used for predicting whether a person with hypertension with certain characteristics will experience a decrease in their systolic or diastolic blood pressure after treatment with antihypertensive drugs.","Nuryunarsih D, Herawati L, Badi'ah A, Donsu JDT, Okatiranti",Curr Hypertens Rep,2023 Nov,Hypertension AND Indonesia
31955506,An overview of hypertension and cardiac involvement in Asia: Focus on heart failure.,"Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is the leading cause of deaths worldwide, contributing to about 30% of all deaths. Half of the cases of CVD are estimated in Asia, the world's most populous continent. Hypertension, a major modifiable risk factor for CVD, results in more deaths than any other CV risk factors in the Asian regions. The total number of patients with hypertension is likely to grow as the population ages. The proportion of the elderly population aged 65 years or more in Asia is expected to increase from 7.4% in 2015 to 10.9% in 2030. It is important to note that more than half (54%) of the world's population live in Asia. Aside of being the biggest single risk factor for global deaths, hypertension is also an important precursor and most common risk factor of heart failure (HF). An increase in HF prevalence is clearly related to the rapid epidemiological transition caused by changes in lifestyle in Asian countries. However, the availability of data on HF burden and health care delivery is limited in Asia compared with Europe and North America. This reality has driven the working group of Asian experts for example the HOPE Asia Network to concentrate on hypertension as risk factors for CVD, with the mission to improve the management of hypertension resulting in organ protection toward a goal of achieving ""ZERO"" CV event in Asia. This paper aims to give an overview regarding the heart problems caused by hypertension in Asia, focus on HF.","Soenarta AA, Buranakitjaroen P, Chia YC, Chen CH, Nailes J, Hoshide S, Minh HV, Park S, Shin J, Siddique S, Sison J, Sogunuru GP, Sukonthasarn A, Tay JC, Teo BW, Turana Y, Verma N, Wang TD, Zhang YQ, Wang JG, Kario K",J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich),2020 Mar,Hypertension AND Indonesia

36999266,Chronic Kidney Disease Care in Indonesia: Challenges and Opportunities.,"The burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant global health concern. Previous study reported that the CKD incidence reached 200 cases per million per year in many countries with the prevalence 11.5% (4.8% in stages 1-2 and 6.7% in stages 3-5). Other study further reported that the estimate prevalence of CKD was 15% higher in low- and middle-income countries compared to the high-income countries. However, there are limited statistics available on the epidemiology of CKD in Indonesia. According to the Basic Health Research (Riset Kesehatan Dasar [Riskesdas], 2018], the prevalence of CKD in Indonesia increased from 0.2% in 2013 to 0.3% in 2018. These results may understate the true prevalence of CKD in our population. Despite the limited data on the CKD prevalence, the number of patients receiving kidney replacement treatment (KRT), primarily in the form of hemodialysis, is rapidly rising (i.e., more than 132.000 in 2018).A comprehensive nephrology referral system is also a challenge. We can argue this statement with evidence from the tertiary care, where it was reported that most kidney failure patients (83%) commenced dialysis with an urgent start, along with late referral to nephrologist (90%), started dialysis with temporary catheter (95.2%), and the median eGFR to start dialysis was 5.3 (range: 0.6 - 14.6) ml/minute/1.73 m2. However, individual awareness, as well as an effective screening and prevention program for high-risk group are also a significant hurdles. Since 2022, the Ministry of Health has initiated a health transformation program to improve the health system, to address health disparities, both within the country and between countries. One of the health transformation programs which specify in nephrology care is the implementation of the Uro-Nephrology Support Program (Program Pengampuan Uro-Nefrologi), with the aim to strengthen services, provide equal distribution of services and increase the latest technology for the diagnosis and treatment of urology/nephrology diseases in Indonesia. This program included secondary and tertiary care to improve the extent and quality of care to slowing the CKD progression, improving kidney replacement therapy (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplant) access and treatment, as well as to provide dialysis training program for health care workers. Providing high-quality nephrology care that all Indonesians can access is challenging. Yet, steps have already been taken in the direction of service enhancement. Thus, there is hope for better kidney health in Indonesia. Governments, academic medical centres, nephrology societies, as well as the citizen will all need to work together and take consistent effort to make a sustainable and comprehensive kidney care.",Hustrini NM,Acta Med Indones,2023 Jan,Hypertension AND Indonesia
30630990,The Emergence of Non-communicable Disease in Indonesia.,"Based on data from the Indonesian Ministry of Health Information Center, the estimated population of Indonesia in 2016 was approximately 258,704,986 people, consisted of 129,988,690 men and 128,716,296 women. This number of Indonesian population represents young population since the proportion of population aged 0-14 years is more than that aged >14 years. Meanwhile, the proportion of population aged 50 years and above is significantly reduced, which is thought to be due to high mortality rate in the middle-aged population. The mortality rate in  Indonesia is dominated by non-communicable diseases (NCD). Alteration in environment, technology and lifestyle have changed the pattern of disease in Indonesia to be dominated by NCD such as DM, heart disease, dyslipidemia, obesity, kidney disease, lung disease, and malignancy.According to the 2014 Indonesian Sample Registration System, the 10 most common diseases were stroke (21.1%), heart disease (12.9%), diabetes mellitus (6.7%), tuberculosis (5.7%), complications of high blood pressure (5.3%), chronic lung disease (4.9%), liver disease (2.7%), traffic accidents (2.6%), pneumonia (2.1%), and combined diarrhea and gastroenteritis due to infection (1.9%). Furthermore, according to Indonesia Basic Health Research 2018, most of NCD such as cancer, stroke, kidney disease, joint disease, DM, heart disease, hypertension, and overweight/ obesity, showed an increasing trend compared to the previous report in 2013.Non-communicable diseases are chronic, often asymptomatic and progressive, thus patients usually did not realize having the disease until the sign and symptoms of its complications occur. This problem drives the need of early screening for high-risk population, early treatment and periodic monitoring. Furthermore, ongoing epidemiological studies are also done to evaluate both established and unknown risk factors, pattern of non-communicable disease development in certain area and the treatment response.",Purnamasari D,Acta Med Indones,2018 Oct,Hypertension AND Indonesia
35819954,"Potential and challenges for an integrated management of tuberculosis, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension: A scoping review protocol.","In many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), the epidemiological transition is characterized by an increased burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and the persistent challenge of infectious diseases. The transmission of tuberculosis, one of the leading infectious diseases, can be halted through active screening of risk groups and early case findings. Studies have reported comorbidities between tuberculosis (TB) and NCDs, which necessitates the development of an integrated disease management model. This scoping review discusses the possibilities and problems of integration in managing TB and NCDs, with a particular emphasis on diabetic mellitus (DM) and hypertension screening and control. We will conduct this review following Arksey and O'Malley's framework for scoping review. We will use key terms related to integrated management, i.e., screening, diagnosis, treatment, and care, of TB, DM, and hypertension in PubMed, Scopus Database, and ScienceDirect for research published from January 2005 to July 2021. This review will also consider grey literature, including unpublished literature and international disease management guidelines on TB, DM, and hypertension from WHO or other health professional organization. We will export the search results to citation manager software (EndNote). We will remove duplicates and apply the inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify the set of papers for the review. After screening the titles and abstract, two authors will independently review the full text of selected studies and extract the data. We will synthesize all selected studies qualitatively and the results will be discussed with the experts.

40275242,The use of oral contraceptives and the risks of developing prehypertension and hypertension in women of reproductive age: findings from a population-based survey in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Although the underlying mechanism of the effect of oral contraceptives (OCs) on blood pressure (BP) remains unclear, previous research showed that OCs are associated with an increased risk of elevated BP. This study aims to analyze the association between OCs and the risk of prehypertension and hypertension in women of reproductive age in Indonesia, using longitudinal data from the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) 5 (2014-2015). METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 10,279 subjects using data from IFLS-5. The study included all women of reproductive age (15-49 years) with complete data on contraceptive use and BP. Sociodemographic factors, physical activity, dietary habits, depressive symptoms, history of tobacco use, and comorbidities were covariates. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to estimate odds ratios (OR), along with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and p-values, comparing women using OCs to those not using contraceptives and those using other modern contraceptive methods. Sub-analyses were conducted for the duration of OC use. RESULTS: The results indicated that OC use was associated with a significantly increased risk of both prehypertension and hypertension. The adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for prehypertension and hypertension were 1.42 (95% CI: 1.16-1.73, p = 0.001) and 1.72 (95% CI: 1.45-2.05, p < 0.001), respectively, compared to non-users. When compared to users of other modern contraceptive methods, the aORs for prehypertension and hypertension were 1.74 (95% CI: 1.21-2.51, p = 0.003) and 1.80 (95% CI: 1.31-2.48, p < 0.001). Sub-analyses showed that the odds of hypertension increased with longer durations of OC use, but no significant association was found for prehypertension. CONCLUSION: There is a statistically significant moderate increase in the risk of prehypertension and hypertension among women of reproductive age in Indonesia who use OCs, with the risk of hypertension increasing with longer durations of OC use. This finding highlights the need for healthcare providers to carefully assess risks when prescribing contraceptives, particularly for women with cardiovascular risk factors.","Zakiyah N, Suciati A, Afina CA, Alfian SD",BMC Public Health,2025 Apr 24,Hypertension AND Indonesia
35660034,Hypertension is associated with antibody response and breakthrough infection in health care workers following vaccination with inactivated SARS-CoV-2.,"Several types of vaccines have been developed to prevent the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is important to understand whether demographic and clinical variables affect the effectiveness of various types of vaccines. This study analysed the association between demographic/clinical factors, antibody response and vaccine effectiveness in healthcare workers vaccinated with inactivated virus. We enrolled 101 healthcare workers who received two doses of inactivated viral vaccine (CoronaVac). Blood samples were analysed at 1, 3, and 5 months after the second dose of vaccination. Data regarding demographic characteristics, medical histories, and clinical parameters were collected by interview and medical examination. In a separate retrospective study, we analysed the incidence of vaccine breakthrough infection on 2714 healthcare workers who received two doses of inactivated viral vaccine. Medical histories and demographic data were collected using a structured self-reported questionnaire. We found that antibody titres markedly increased at 1 month after vaccination but gradually decreased at 3-5 months post-vaccination. We observed a significant association between age (>/=40 years) and antibody level, whereas sex and body mass index (BMI) exhibited no effect on antibody titres. Amongst clinical variables analysed, high blood pressure and history of hypertension were significantly correlated with lower antibody titres. Consistently, we found a significant association in the retrospective study between hypertension and the incidence of breakthrough infection. In conclusion, our results showed that hypertension is associated with lower antibody titres and breakthrough infection following COVID-19 vaccination. Thus, blood pressure control might be important to improve the efficacy of inactivated virus vaccine.","Soegiarto G, Wulandari L, Purnomosari D, Dhia Fahmita K, Ikhwan Gautama H, Tri Hadmoko S, Edwin Prasetyo M, Aulia Mahdi B, Arafah N, Prasetyaningtyas D, Prawiro Negoro P, Rosita Sigit Prakoeswa C, Endaryanto A, Gede Agung Suprabawati D, Tinduh D, Basuki Rachmad E, Astha Triyono E, Wahyuhadi J, Budi Keswardiono C, Elyana Wardani F, Mayorita F, Kristiani N, Baskoro A, Fetarayani D, Kartika Nurani W, Oceandy D",Vaccine,2022 Jun 26,Hypertension AND Indonesia
38424373,Beta-blocker efficacy for intra- and interdialytic hypertension patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"PURPOSE: Intradialytic hypertension affects 5-15% of hemodialysis patients, yet relevant studies are relatively scarce. It is also associated with higher interdialytic blood pressure. Beta-blockers can be preferred as antihypertensive drugs due to their superior blood pressure control, decreased risk of cardiovascular events, improved endothelial cell function, and decreased noradrenaline levels. Through this study, beta-blocker antihypertensive effects in intra- and interdialytic hypertension were analyzed. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis were performed following PRISMA guidelines. We registered our PROSPERO protocol (Registration ID: CRD42023446184) and included relevant full-text clinical trials or RCTs from 2008 to 2023 with predetermined keywords and criteria from multiple databases including PUBMED, COCHRANE, SCOPUS, and citation searching. Seven eligible articles were included in this review study. RESULTS: Four studies with 82 participants for intradialytic hypertension evaluation were included. Meta-analysis showed a decrease in SBP in intradialytic hypertensive patients after beta-blocker intervention, with a significant estimated mean difference of - 15.19 mmHg (P < 0.00001; 95% CI - 19.47 to - 10.91). Supporting previous data, SBP remains constant between pre- and post-dialysis with beta-blocker therapy, with an insignificant estimated mean difference of - 2.72 mmHg (P = 0.29; 95% CI - 7.80 to 2.36). Whereas five studies with 142 participants were included for interdialytic hypertension evaluation. Meta-analysis shows a significant decrease in SBP before to after therapy, with an estimated mean difference of - 10.92 (P < 0.0001; 95% CI - 16.33 to - 5.51).

This study intended to characterize the clinical manifestation of COVID-19 in patients with asthma, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus (DM). We analyzed data from 540 medical records of patients with comorbidities like asthma, hypertension, and DM diagnosed with COVID-19, looking at vital signs upon admission, chest X-ray, and laboratory results. Most patients were male (57.0%). The most prevalent comorbidity was hypertension (46.3%) and DM (46.3%), followed by asthma (7.4%). 273 patients had improved condition (50.6%). Patients with hypertension had the most extended length of stay compared to other comorbidities groups (13.0+/-8.5 days). There were significant differences in the oxygen saturation and respiration rate between the three groups (p=0.002, p<0.0001, respectively). The mean lymphocyte (p=0.028) and hematocrit count (p=0.001) were significantly different between the three comorbid groups, with the hypertension group having the highest mean lymphocyte (15.1+/-8.9) and hematocrit (38.7+/-6.9) count. COVID-19 had a significant impact on patients with asthma, hypertension, and diabetes comorbidities concerning the final condition, length of stay, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate, and also on the hematology level, mainly lymphocyte and hematocrit.

33591641,Clinical significance of nocturnal home blood pressure monitoring and nocturnal hypertension in Asia.,"Nocturnal home blood pressure (BP) monitoring has been used in clinical practice for ~20 years. The authors recently showed that nocturnal systolic BP (SBP) measured by a home BP monitoring (HBPM) device in a Japanese general practice population was a significant predictor of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, independent of office and morning home SBP levels, and that masked nocturnal hypertension obtained by HBPM (defined as nocturnal home BP >/= 120/70 mmHg and average morning and evening BP < 135/85 mmHg) was associated with an increased risk of CVD events compared with controlled BP (nocturnal home BP < 120/70 mmHg and average morning and evening BP < 135/85 mmHg). This evidence revealed that (a) it is feasible to use a nocturnal HBPM device for monitoring nocturnal BP levels, and (b) such a device may offer an alternative to ambulatory BP monitoring, which has been the gold standard for the measurement of nocturnal BP. However, many unresolved clinical problems remain, such as the measurement schedule and conditions for the use of nocturnal HBPM. Further investigation of the measurement of nocturnal BP using an HBPM device and assessments of the prognostic value are thus warranted. Asians are at high risk of developing nocturnal hypertension due to high salt sensitivity and salt intake, and the precise management of their nocturnal BP levels is important. Information and communication technology-based monitoring devices are expected to facilitate the management of nocturnal hypertension in Asian populations.","Fujiwara T, Hoshide S, Tomitani N, Cheng HM, Soenarta AA, Turana Y, Chen CH, Minh HV, Sogunuru GP, Tay JC, Wang TD, Chia YC, Verma N, Li Y, Wang JG, Kario K",J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich),2021 Mar,Hypertension AND Indonesia
33708303,"Carotid intima-media thickness, hypertension, and dyslipidemia in obese adolescents.","INTRODUCTION: Obesity is a global health problem with growing prevalence in developing countries. Obesity causes chronic inflammation due to imbalances between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. This causes metabolic complications such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, and cardiovascular disorder. Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) is a predictor of atherosclerosis which could be measured easily and non-invasively. Early detection of cardiovascular diseases in obese adolescents at risk is hoped to improve outcomes. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study on obese adolescents aged 13-16 year old at Pediatric Clinic of Dr. Soetomo General Hospital. Obesity is defined as Body mass index higher than 95(th) percentiles according to CDC (2000). Dyslipidemia is diagnosed when either an increase in cholesterol, LDL, triglyceride or a decrease in HDL level is found, as recommended by NCPE and American Academy of Pediatrics. Hypertension is defined as an increase of blood pressure > P95 according to age and gender. The differences of CIMT based on dyslipidemia, hypertension, and gender were analyzed with Wilcoxon Mann Whitney with significant p value (p < 0,005). RESULTS: This study included 59 obese adolescents, consisting of 32 (54.2%) male adolescents and 35 (59.3%) female adolescents. Dyslipidemia was found on 38 (64.4%) adolescents and hypertension was found on 35 (59.3%) adolescents. No difference of CIMT was found between obese adolescents with and without dyslipidemia and with and without hypertension based on gender (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: No difference of CIMT based on gender between adolescents aged below 18. The high number of dyslipidemia and hypertension in obese adolescents need an early detection of cardiovascular complication.","Widjaja NA, Irawan R, Prihaningtyas RA, Ardiana M, Hanindita MH",Pan Afr Med J,2019,Hypertension AND Indonesia
34718034,Effect of Different Types of Aerobic Exercise on Individuals With and Without Hypertension: An Updated Systematic Review.,"High blood pressure (BP) is one of the main modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and preventing it greatly reduces the vascular consequences of aging and, along with intensive treatment of hypertension, eliminates a large portion of the burden of CVD-related mortality. Many meta-analyses and studies proved that regular aerobic exercise (AE) reduces BP but most of these studies consider only hypertensive populations or only AE but not resistant exercise or their combination. In this review, we aimed to study the effect of different types of physical activity (PA)/AE on various populations including normotensive, prehypertensive, primary hypertensive, and resistant hypertensive with different comorbidities. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar for English articles with keywords for physical activity, aerobic exercise, and blood pressure from January 2010 until September 2021. Finally, 24 studies were included. Results showed that chronic or acute AE (long-term or short-term), either alone or as combined with different sessions and programs can reduce systolic and diastolic BP in every group including normotensive, prehypertensive, primary hypertensive, resistant hypertensive individuals and diabetic patients and those with kidney problems but not in people with chronic heart failure. Isometric exercise training showed to be useful in reducing BP in all groups either as low intensity or as high intensity but the rate of reduction was different in terms of gender. AE showed to be effective in terms of BP reduction in a different age range. It can be seen that different types and duration of AE independent of the modality and programs and independent of the BP medical situation of individuals have been successful in terms of BP reduction. For those with chronic heart failure, more concern and help might be needed to decrease BP via exercise.","Esmailiyan M, Amerizadeh A, Vahdat S, Ghodsi M, Doewes RI, Sundram Y",Curr Probl Cardiol,2023 Mar,Hypertension AND Indonesia

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of edentulism and associated factors among older adults in Indonesia. METHOD: This study examines the self-reported prevalence of edentulism and associated factors among older adults (50 years and older) in a cross-sectional national study using the Indonesia Family Life Survey IFLS-5, 2014/15. The community-based study uses a multi-stage stratified sampling design to interview and assess household members, with a household response rate of over 90%. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of edentulism was 7.2, 29.8% in 80 years and older and 11.8% in those with no formal education. In adjusted Poisson regression analysis, older age, living in five major island groups and having functional disability were associated with edentulism. In addition, among men, having quit and current tobacco use and among women, having low social capital were associated with edentulism. Further, in adjusted analysis, among men, edentulism was positively associated with hypertension and negatively associated with diabetes, and among women, edentulism was associated with functional disability. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that overall and/or among men or women that older age, living in five major island groups, having functional disability, tobacco quitters and users and those with low social capital was associated with edentulism. The identified associated factors of edentulism may be utilized in oral health programmes targeting older adults in Indonesia.","Pengpid S, Peltzer K",BMC Oral Health,2018 Jul 3,Hypertension AND Indonesia

The family has an important role in maintaining blood pressure (BP) at home, and sodium diet compliance in people with HTN needs to be developed. Therefore, this research aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a family self-management program (FSMP) in HTN management and compliance with sodium consumption in rural areas of Indonesia. Study Design: A parallel-group, single-blind randomized controlled trial. METHODS: One hundred twenty-six eligible participants were randomly allocated to an intervention (n=63) and a control group (n=63). Participants in the intervention group received a 24-week (6-month) FSMP intervention. The primary outcome measures included the systolic and diastolic BP, the Score Sodium Questionnaire (SSQ), and the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale 8 (MMAS-8). The Knowledge of Health Care for HTN questionnaire and the Efficacy and Behavior Toward Health Care for Patients with HTN questionnaire were used to assess the secondary outcome. RESULTS: The final results were analyzed from 121 participants (n=61 intervention and n=60 control group). The repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA) test results demonstrated significant effects on the management of HTN and adherence to sodium consumption as indicated by systolic (P=0.004) and diastolic BP (P=0.006), SSQ (P<0.001), MMAS 8 (P<0.001), caregivers' knowledge (P<0.001), caregivers' self-efficacy (P<0.001), and caregivers' behaviors (P=0.005). CONCLUSION: The FMSP emerges as a promising strategy for managing BP and adherence to sodium consumption in people with HTN through the support of family caregivers and selfmanagement activities.","Susanto T, Hernawati S, Yunanto RA, Rahmawati I, Laras Ati NA, Fauziah W",J Res Health Sci,2024 Sep 30,Hypertension AND Indonesia

38616386,Current insights and future perspectives of flavonoids: A promising antihypertensive approach.,"Hypertension, or high blood pressure (BP), is a complex disease influenced by various risk factors. It is characterized by persistent elevation of BP levels, typically exceeding 140/90 mmHg. Endothelial dysfunction and reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability play crucial roles in hypertension development. L-NG-nitro arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an analog of L-arginine, inhibits endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) enzymes, leading to decreased NO production and increased BP. Animal models exposed to L-NAME manifest hypertension, making it a useful design for studying the hypertension condition. Natural products have gained interest as alternative approaches for managing hypertension. Flavonoids, abundant in fruits, vegetables, and other plant sources, have potential cardiovascular benefits, including antihypertensive effects. Flavonoids have been extensively studied in cell cultures, animal models, and, to lesser extent, in human trials to evaluate their effectiveness against L-NAME-induced hypertension. This comprehensive review summarizes the antihypertensive activity of specific flavonoids, including quercetin, luteolin, rutin, troxerutin, apigenin, and chrysin, in L-NAME-induced hypertension models. Flavonoids possess antioxidant properties that mitigate oxidative stress, a major contributor to endothelial dysfunction and hypertension. They enhance endothelial function by promoting NO bioavailability, vasodilation, and the preservation of vascular homeostasis. Flavonoids also modulate vasoactive factors involved in BP regulation, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and endothelin-1. Moreover, they exhibit anti-inflammatory effects, attenuating inflammation-mediated hypertension. This review provides compelling evidence for the antihypertensive potential of flavonoids against L-NAME-induced hypertension. Their multifaceted mechanisms of action suggest their ability to target multiple pathways involved in hypertension development. Nonetheless, the reviewed studies contribute to the evidence supporting the useful of flavonoids for hypertension prevention and treatment. In conclusion, flavonoids represent a promising class of natural compounds for combating hypertension. This comprehensive review serves as a valuable resource summarizing the current knowledge on the antihypertensive effects of specific flavonoids, facilitating further investigation and guiding the development of novel therapeutic strategies for hypertension management.","Harahap U, Syahputra RA, Ahmed A, Nasution A, Wisely W, Sirait ML, Dalimunthe A, Zainalabidin S, Taslim NA, Nurkolis F, Kim B",Phytother Res,2024 Jun,Hypertension AND Indonesia

SETTING: The study was conducted in seven districts in three provinces in Indonesia, with approximately 50% of the primary healthcare (PHC) were selected as areas for data collection (n PHC=100). PARTICIPANTS: From 475 POSBINDU sites, we collected secondary data from 54 224 participants. For the qualitative approach, 21 FGDs and 2 in-depth interviews were held among a total of 223 informants. PRIMARY OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Proportion of POSBINDU visitors getting the hypertension screening and risk factors' assessment, and barriers of POSBINDU implementation. RESULTS: Out of the 114 581 POSBINDU visits by 54 224 participants, most (80%) were women and adults over 50 years old (50%) showing a suboptimal coverage of men and younger adults. Approximately 95.1% of visitors got their blood pressure measured during their first visit; 35.3% of whom had elevated blood pressure. Less than 25% of the visitors reported to be interviewed for NCDs risk factors during their first visit, less than 80% had anthropometric measurements and less than 15% had blood cholesterol examinations. We revealed lack of resources and limited time to perform the complexities of activities and reporting as main barrier for effective hypertension screening in Indonesia. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed missed opportunities in hypertension risk factors screening in Indonesia. The barriers include a lack of access and implementation barriers (capability, resources and protocols).","Widyaningsih V, Febrinasari RP, Pamungkasari EP, Mashuri YA, Sumardiyono S, Balgis B, Koot J, Landsman-Dijkstra J, Probandari A",BMJ Open,2022 Feb 21,Hypertension AND Indonesia
25948773,Management of hypertension in pregnancy.,"Hypertension-related maternal mortality reaches 16% when it is compared to other causes of maternal mortality such as sepsis, bleeding or abortus. Pregnant women with hypertension disorder are at increased risk for experiencing numerous complications including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), cerebral hemorrhage, liver dysfunction and acute renal failure; while to the fetus, it may cause intrauterine growth retardation, prematurity and perinatal mortality. Hypertension in pregnancy should be managed appropriately to reduce maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality rate, i.e. by preventing women from getting the risks of increased blood pressure, preventing disease progression and preventing the development of seizure and considering termination of pregnancy in life-threatening situation for maternal and fetal health.","Mudjari NS, Samsu N",Acta Med Indones,2015 Jan,Hypertension AND Indonesia
34717930,Hypertension and COVID-19: Potential use of beta-blockers and a call for randomized evidence.,"Hypertension is one of the most common morbidities in COVID-19. Previous studies demonstrated that hypertension increases composite poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Beta-blockers is widely used as one of the most common antihypertensive agents. Beta-blockers may hold potential benefits in COVID-19 treatment, with current evidence of the potential mechanism of beta-blockers remains scarce. However, several mechanisms were suggested, including decreasing RAAS pathway activity and lowering the ACE2 levels, reducing cytokine storms, and may be beneficial in reducing mortality in ARDS related COVID-19. Further large-scale randomized clinical trials should be conducted before a definite recommendation can be drawn.","Alsagaff MY, Mulia EPB",Indian Heart J,2021 Nov-Dec,Hypertension AND Indonesia
37096701,Relationship between anxiety and spiritual well-being of the elderly with hypertension during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"OBJECTIVES: To study the relationship between anxiety and the spiritual wellbeing of hypertensive elderly patients during the corona virus disease-2019 pandemic. METHOD: The cross-sectional, correlational, analytical study was conducted from March to May 2022 in Lamongan Regency, East Java, Indonesia, after approval from the Faculty of Nursing, Universitas Airlangga, Surabaya, Indonesia, and comprised elderly hypertensive subjects aged >45 years who had good cognitive skills. Data was collected using the Geriatric Anxiety Scale and the Spiritual Wellbeing Scale. Anxiety was the independent variable, while spiritual wellbeing was the dependent variable. Data was analysed using univariate and bivariate analyses. RESULTS: Of the 200 subjects, 107(53.5%) were females and 93(46.5%) were males. Overall, 97(48.5%) were aged 45-49 years, 81(40.5%) had completed primary school, 96(48%) were farmers, 121(60.5%) had moderate anxiety and 80(40%) had moderate spiritual wellbeing. There was a significant relationship between anxiety and spiritual wellbeing (p<0.05). Age, education and occupation of the subjects had significant association with both anxiety and spiritual wellbeing (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The coronavirus disease-2019 led to decreased anxiety and increased spiritual wellbeing among the hypertensive elderly.","Yusuf A, Efendi F, Susanto J, Dewi WK, Hidaayah N",J Pak Med Assoc,2023 Feb,Hypertension AND Indonesia
34525441,Predicting length of stay and mortality among hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension.,"BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension (HTN), both non-communicable diseases, are leading causes of death globally, with more imbalances in lower middle-income countries. Furthermore, poor treatment and management are known to lead to intensified healthcare utilization and increased medical care costs and impose a significant societal burden, in these countries, including Indonesia. Predicting future clinical outcomes can determine the line of treatment and value of healthcare costs, while ensuring effective patient care. In this paper, we present the prediction of length of stay (LoS) and mortality among hospitalized patients at a tertiary referral hospital in Tasikmalaya, Indonesia, between 2016 and 2019. We also aimed to determine how socio-demographic characteristics, and T2DM- or HTN-related comorbidities affect inpatient LoS and mortality. METHODS: We analyzed insurance claims data of 4376 patients with T2DM or HTN hospitalized in the referral hospital. We used four prediction models based on machine-learning algorithms for LoS prediction, in relation to disease severity, physician-in-charge, room type, co-morbidities, and types of procedures performed. We used five classifiers based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) to predict inpatient mortality and compared them according to training time, testing time, and Area under Receiver Operative Curve (AUROC). Classifier accuracy measures, which included positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), F-Measure, and recall, were used as performance evaluation methods. RESULTS: A Random forest best predicted inpatient LoS (R2, 0.70; root mean square error [RMSE], 1.96; mean absolute error [MAE], 0.935), and the gradient boosting regression model also performed similarly (R2, 0.69; RMSE, 1.96; MAE, 0.935). For inpatient mortality, best results were observed using MLP with back propagation (AUROC 0.899; 69.33 and 98.61 for PPV and NPV, respectively). The other classifiers, stochastic gradient descent with regression loss function, Huber, and random forest models all showed an average performance. CONCLUSIONS: Linear regression model best predicted LoS and mortality was best predicted using MLP. Patients with primary diseases such as T2DM or HTN may have comorbidities that can prolong inpatient LoS. Physicians play an important role in disseminating health related information. These predictions could assist in the development of health policies and strategies that reduce disease burden in resource-limited settings.","Barsasella D, Gupta S, Malwade S, Aminin, Susanti Y, Tirmadi B, Mutamakin A, Jonnagaddala J, Syed-Abdul S",Int J Med Inform,2021 Oct,Hypertension AND Indonesia
38824234,Treatment intensification and therapeutic inertia of antihypertensive therapy among patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension with uncontrolled blood pressure.,"Treatment intensification is essential to ensure guideline targets are attained in diabetes patients. The failure to intensify treatment when the targets are not achieved is therapeutic inertia. This study aimed to determine the proportions and factors associated with treatment intensification and therapeutic inertia of antihypertensive therapy in type 2 diabetes patients with uncontrolled hypertension in Malaysia. A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted utilising registry data. Diabetes hypertensive patients with uncontrolled baseline systolic or diastolic blood pressure were included. Treatment intensification was the increase in the number of antihypertensive agents from the index treatment. Therapeutic inertia was the absence of treatment intensification when the second blood pressure reading was still uncontrolled. About 6956 patients were followed up over 2.5 +/- 1.1 person-years. Treatment intensification was observed in 29.8% of patients, while 38.6% had therapeutic inertia. Chinese, Indian, and 'others' ethnic groups, retinopathy, more antihypertensive agents, and higher systolic blood pressure were associated with therapeutic inertia. Underweight, overweight patients and those with dyslipidaemia had lower risks for therapeutic inertia. The results indicate suboptimal quality of care in public health clinics in Malaysia. Further studies are needed to determine the underlying causes to formulate precise interventions to tackle the problem in Malaysia.","Wan KS, Moy FM, Mohd Yusoff MF, Mustapha F, Ismail M, Mat Rifin H, Yoga Ratnam KK, Ismail H, Chong KK, Ahmad NA, Hairi NN",Sci Rep,2024 Jun 1,Hypertension AND Indonesia

A total of 51 participants with hypertension/prehypertension in Indonesia were randomly assigned to a control group or one of two intervention groups: salt-reduction training or salt-reduction and efficacy-maintenance. The salt-reduction and efficacy-maintenance group received educational training and a maintenance meeting; the participants' knowledge, attitudes, self-care practices, and self-efficacy significantly improved after training and were maintained after the maintenance meeting. Participants in the salt-reduction training group showed significant effects for the same variables; however, their food salt concentrations rebounded after the maintenance meeting. No significant improvement was found in the control group. The salt-reduction and efficacy-maintenance group participants reported positive effects of salt reduction and different practices based on who prepared their meals. The salt-reduction and efficacy-maintenance group program was effective in improving and maintaining knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy of salt-reduction practices and could be applied with community-dwelling older people with high blood pressure.","Irwan AM, Kato M, Kitaoka K, Ueno E, Tsujiguchi H, Shogenji M",Nurs Health Sci,2016 Dec,Hypertension AND Indonesia

17132887,"Hypertension: diagnostic problem, challenge and dilemmas.","An elevated arterial pressure is probably the most important public health problem. The prevalence of hypertension depends on both the racial composition of the population studied and the criteria used to define the condition. Patients with hypertension die prematurely, the most common cause of death is heart disease, stroke, and renal failure. The JNC-7 report has introduced a new classification that includes term ""pre-hypertension"". The new classification may make a new dilemma in the management since the main treatment of pre-hypertension is the lifestyle changes. What do we recommend to lean patients with pre-hypertension who are already following a prudent lifestyle? The ultimate public health goal of antihypertensive therapy is the reduction of cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. The question is, what should the blood pressure goal be? For patients without any compiling condition, it was assumed that 140/90 mmHg was desired treatment target level. For diabetic patient, it is reasonable to target a blood pressure well within the normal range, at most 130/80 mmHg. Some newer studies suggest that the target of treatment may force the recommended goal even lower, even for the patient without any compiling condition. For elderly individuals, a goal of 140/90 mmHg is appropriate. Hypertension during pregnancy is one of important aspects, since blood pressure during pregnancy may change related to the gestational age. This is always subject of discussion because there is no evidence that pharmacologic treatment results in improved neonatal outcomes, lower blood pressure may, in fact uteroplacental perfusion and thereby jeopardize fetal development. It means that more attention is needed for hypertensive patients not only for treatment regimens choice but also the blood pressure target. The accurate measurement of blood pressure is the sine qua non for successful management of hypertension. The operator should be trained and regularly retrained in the standardized technique, to avoid the chance of mismanagement.",Rudijanto A,Acta Med Indones,2006 Oct-Dec,Hypertension AND Indonesia
35899382,The association of depression and central obesity on hypertension in Indonesian provinces: a path analysis of the Indonesian baseline health research 2018 data.,"Purpose: This study aims to analyse the direct and indirect relationship between the prevalence of depression and hypertension through central obesity in the Indonesian population.Material and methods: This quantitative analytical observational study is based on secondary data with a cross-sectional design. The data is taken from the Indonesian Baseline Health Research of the Health Research and Development Agency in 2018, which is aggregated data from survey results on household members in 34 Indonesian provinces. We used path analysis and the Sobel test using AMOS 23.0 program to assess the direct and indirect relationship of depression and obesity to hypertension. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the effect of confounding factors on hypertension.Results: The average prevalence (+/- SD) of depression, central obesity and hypertension in 2018 was 6.21% (+/- 2.30), 31.26% (+/- 4.80), and 31.07% (+/- 4.76). There was an indirect positive relationship between depression and hypertension through central obesity (p = 0.041). The direct effect of depression was associated with a 17% chance of being centrally obese (p = 0.009), and the direct effect of depression and central obesity was associated with a 32.7% chance of becoming hypertensive (p = 0.001). There is no significant direct relationship between depression and hypertension. The effect of confounding factors on hypertension was 21.9% (p = 0.007), lower than the effect of depression and central obesity.Conclusion: Central obesity might be an intermediate variable linking depression and hypertension.","Hadi AS, Lefi A, Pikir BS, Utomo B, Lusida TTE",Blood Press,2022 Dec,Hypertension AND Indonesia
37104925,"A retrospective cohort study of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic syndrome risk in women with history of preterm and term preeclampsia five years after delivery.","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate maternal hypertension, risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and metabolic syndrome five years after delivery in preterm preeclampsia (P-PE), term preeclampsia (T-PE), and normal pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study of women who delivered at Dr. Soetomo Academic Hospital (Indonesia) in 2013 with a diagnosis of PE and were compared with women with normal pregnancies. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Blood pressure, National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria for metabolic syndrome (NCE-ATP III), and Framingham Risk Score (FRS). RESULTS: In this study, 92 women participated. They were divided into the P-PE (27), T-PE (35), and control groups (30). Women with a history of PE, P-PE, or T-PE had higher blood pressure five years after delivery than those in the control group (p < 0.05). Systolic blood pressure (SBP) >140 mmHg was seen in 66.7% of P-PE and 25.7% of T-PE, while 55.6% of P-PE and 34.3% of T-PE had diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >90 mmHg (p < 0.05). Women with P-PE had the highest risk of developing hypertension (Relative risk (RR): 20; 95% Confidence interval [CI]: 2.85-139.92). Women with history of P-PE (RR: 1.85; 95% CI: 0.77-4.41), T-PE (RR: 1.28; 95% CI: 0.51-3.19), and total PE (RR: 1.53; 95% CI: 0.68-3.43) had an increased risk of positive NECP-ATP III five years after delivery. Women with history of P-PE (RR: 5.17; 95% CI: 0.26-103.22; p = 0.282) and T-PE (RR: 6.03; 95% CI: 0.32-112.22; p = 0.228) are at a greater risk of having an FRS >10% compared to the control group (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: History of PE, P-PE, and T-PE increased the risk of hypertension and CVD five years after delivery. The results also showed a tendency toward an increased risk of metabolic syndrome in women with a previous history of PE and P-PE.","Aditiawarman, Zulhijayanti NA, Ernawati E, Akbar MIA",Pregnancy Hypertens,2023 Jun,Hypertension AND Indonesia

Using multiple waves of population-based cohort data from four MICs (China, Indonesia, Mexico, and South Africa), we undertook a longitudinal investigation into how individuals with hypertension move through care over time. We classified adults aged 40 years and over (N = 8527) into care stages at both baseline and follow-up waves and estimated the probability of transitioning between stages using Poisson regression models. Over a 5- to 9-year follow-up period, only around 30% of undiagnosed individuals became diagnosed [Mexico, 27% (95% confidence interval: 23%, 31%); China, 30% (26%, 33%); Indonesia, 30% (28%, 32%); and South Africa, 36% (31%, 41%)], and one in four untreated individuals became treated [Indonesia, 11% (10%, 12%); Mexico, 24% (20%, 28%); China, 26% (23%, 29%); and South Africa, 33% (29%, 38%)]. The probability of reaching blood pressure (BP) control was lower [Indonesia, 2% (1%, 2%); China, 9% (7%, 11%); Mexico, 12% (9%, 14%); and South Africa, 24% (20%, 28%)] regardless of treatment status. A substantial proportion of individuals discontinued treatment [Indonesia, 70% (67%, 73%); China, 36% (32%, 40%); Mexico, 34% (29%, 39%); and South Africa, 20% (15%, 25%)], and most individuals lost BP control by follow-up [Indonesia, 92% (89%, 96%); Mexico, 77% (71%, 83%); China, 76% (69%, 83%); and South Africa 45% (36%, 54%)]. Our results highlight that policies solely aimed at improving diagnosis or initiating treatment may not lead to long-term hypertension control improvements in MICs.","Mauer N, Geldsetzer P, Manne-Goehler J, Davies JI, Stokes AC, McConnell M, Ali MK, Winkler V, Sudharsanan N",Sci Transl Med,2022 Jul 6,Hypertension AND Indonesia
30943932,Prevalence and distribution of metabolic syndrome and its components among provinces and ethnic groups in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Global increase of metabolic syndrome (MetS) may have affected Indonesia, however, lack of data in this multiethnic group country warrants a nationwide study for MetS and its components. This study aims to determine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its components among Indonesian people based on the province and ethnic groups. METHODS: We obtained 8573 subjects from the Indonesian Family Life Survey Wave 4 (IFLS4), spread over 20 provinces in Indonesia and consisting of 27 ethnic groups. MetS was operationalized according to an adapted Harmonized MetS definition. Prevalence ratios with 95% confidence interval were estimated using log-binomial regression. RESULTS: The prevalence of MetS in Indonesia is 21.66% with provincial prevalence ranging from 0 to 50%, while the ethnic prevalence ranging from 0 to 45.45%. Significant higher MetS prevalence ratios were found in Jakarta (PR 1.826; 95CI 1.628-2.048), West Nusa Tenggara (PR 1.412; 95CI: 1.222-1.630), West Sumatra (PR 1.404; 95CI: 1.202-1.641), East Java province (PR 1.109; 95CI: 1.001-1.229) and in Sasak (PR 1.532; 95CI:1.304-1.800), Minangkabau (PR 1.469; 95CI:1.251-1.726), Betawi (PR 1.597; 95CI:1.346-1.895), Acehnese ethnic group (PR 2.101; 95CI:1.099-4.020) while significant lower prevalence ratios were observed in Central Java (PR 0.668; 95CI: 0.580-0.770), Yogyakarta (PR 0.695; 95CI: 0.575-0.840), Banten (PR 0.718; 95CI: 0.533-0.968), Bali province (PR 0.724; 95CI: 0.590-0.889) and in Javanese (PR 0.855; 95CI:0.788-0.928), also Balinese ethnic groups (PR 0.669; 95CI:0.535-0.836). The highest prevalence of MetS components among Indonesians was low HDL cholesterol (66.41%), followed by hypertension (64.45%), and central obesity (43.21%).

25652531,Assessing socioeconomic inequalities of hypertension among women in Indonesia's major cities.,"Although hypertension has been recognized as one of the major public health problems, few studies address economic inequality of hypertension among urban women in developing countries. To assess this issue, we analysed data for 1400 women from four of Indonesia's major cities: Jakarta, Surabaya, Medan and Bandung. Women were aged ⩾15 years (mean age 35.4 years), and were participants in the 2007/2008 Indonesia Family Life Survey. The prevalence of hypertension measured by digital sphygmomanometer among this population was 31%. Using a multivariable logistic regression model, socioeconomic disadvantage (based on household assets and characteristics) as well as age, body mass index and economic conditions were significantly associated with hypertension (P<0.05). Applying the Fairlie decomposition model, results showed that 14% of the inequality between less and more economically advantaged groups could be accounted for by the distribution of socioeconomic characteristics. Education was the strongest contributor to inequality, with lower education levels increasing the predicted probability of hypertension among less economically advantaged groups. This work highlights the importance of socioeconomic inequality in the development of hypertension, and particularly the effects of education level.","Christiani Y, Byles JE, Tavener M, Dugdale P",J Hum Hypertens,2015 Nov,Hypertension AND Indonesia

This study was conducted among male workers (n = 31) in an oil and gas worksite in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Body weight, height, waist circumference, as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured. Weekly food consumption patterns were assessed using 1 day 24 h dietary recall (24HR), 1 day weighed food record (WFR), and 5 day food tally. Linear programming (LP) analysis using WHO Optifood software was used to identify problem nutrients and develop FBRs. The identified nutrient gaps were inserted in the nutrient-dense menu for the worksite canteen. Obesity, central obesity, and hypertension were reported in 64.5%, 48.4%, and 3.2% of the workers. Calcium, folate, total PUFA, n-6 PUFA, and dietary fiber were identified as problem nutrients. The FBRs can improve the intake of problem nutrients from 20% of recommended nutrient intake (RNI) in the nonoptimized diet to 50-70% RNI in the optimized diet, while controlling the intake of sodium and saturated fat within an acceptable range. The remaining nutrient gaps (calcium, total PUFA, n-6 PUFA, and dietary fiber) were inserted into the 14-day modified canteen snack menu. This study provides initial evidence that a combination of FBRs and a modified canteen menu can optimize the diet of the workers. Further studies assessing the effectiveness of the developed FBRs and modified menus are needed.","Zahra NL, Chandra DN, Mansyur M, Fahmida U",Nutrients,2023 Sep 25,Hypertension AND Indonesia

METHODS: Data were collected during household surveys conducted between 2016 and 2020 in the five surveillance sites in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Viet Nam. We defined hypertension as systolic blood pressure >/= 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure >/= 90 mmHg or taking blood pressure-lowering medication. We defined hypertension control as systolic blood pressure < 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg. We disaggregated hypertension awareness, treatment and control by surveillance site, and within each site by sex, age group, education, body mass index and smoking status. FINDINGS: Of 22 142 participants, 11 137 had hypertension (Bangladesh: 211; India: 487; Indonesia: 1641; Malaysia: 8164; and Viet Nam: 634). The mean age of participants with hypertension was 60 years (range: 19-101 years). Only in the Malaysian site were more than half of individuals with hypertension aware of their condition. Hypertension treatment ranged from 20.8% (341/1641; 95% CI: 18.8-22.8%) in the Indonesian site to 44.7% (3649/8164; 95% CI: 43.6-45.8%) in the Malaysian site. Less than one in four participants with hypertension had achieved hypertension control in any site. Hypertension awareness, treatment and control were generally higher among women and older adults. CONCLUSION: While hypertension awareness and treatment varied widely across surveillance sites, hypertension control was low in all sites.","Geldsetzer P, Tan MM, Dewi FS, Quyen BT, Juvekar S, Hanifi SM, Roy S, Asgari-Jirhandeh N, Reidpath D, Su TT",Bull World Health Organ,2022 Oct 1,Hypertension AND Indonesia
37202071,Plasma brain derived neurotrophic factor level as a modifying factor for trans fat intake and hypertension.,"BACKGROUND & AIM: Long-term consumption of trans-fat has been linked with its incorporation in brain neural membrane that could lead into alteration of signalling pathways, including Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). As an ubiquitous neurotrophin, BDNF is believed to play a role in the regulation of blood pressure yet prior studies shown conflicting results to its effect. Moreover, direct effect of trans fat intake to hypertension has not yet been elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the role of BDNF and its association between trans-fat intake and hypertension. MATERIALS & METHODS: We conducted a population study in Natuna Regency which once reportedly has the highest prevalence of hypertension from Indonesian National Health Survey. Subjects with hypertension and those without hypertension were recruited for the study. Demographic data, physical examination, and food recall were collected. The level of BDNF from all subjects were obtained through analysis of blood samples. RESULTS: A total of 181 participants were included in this study, comprising 134 (74%) hypertensive subjects and 47 (26%) normotensive subjects. Median of daily trans-fat intake of hypertensive subjects was higher compared to normotensive subjects (0,013 [0,0003-0,07] vs 0,010 [0,0006-0,06] % of total energy/day, p = 0,021). Interaction analysis showed significant results for plasma BDNF level in relationship of trans-fat intake and hypertension (p = 0,011). Trans-fat intake association to hypertension in overall subjects showed odds ratio (OR) of 1,85 95%CI 1,05-3,26 (p = 0,034), while in those with low-middle tercile BDNF level the OR was 3,35 95%CI 1,46-7,68 (p = 0,004). CONCLUSION: Plasma BDNF level has a modifying effect in the association between trans-fat intake and hypertension. Subjects with high trans-fat intake, while having low BDNF level, have the highest probability for hypertension.","Harlyjoy BC, Sukmawan R, Muliawan HS, Soerarso R, Radi B, Widyantoro B",Clin Nutr ESPEN,2023 Jun,Hypertension AND Indonesia
36227632,Prevalence and risk factors for chronic kidney disease in Indonesia: An analysis of the National Basic Health Survey 2018.,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Indonesia is rising, but the exact extent of the burden of CKD in Indonesia is unknown. To design a screening program for individuals at high-risk, more knowledge is required regarding the prevalence and risk factors of CKD in Indonesia. The latter could have a big impact on the prevention and management of patients with CKD in Indonesia. METHODS: For this purpose, we analysed data from The National Basic Health Survey 2018 (Riset Kesehatan Dasar, Riskesdas 2018), a descriptive cross-sectional study in 34 provinces, 416 districts and 98 cities in Indonesia. We included subjects aged >/=18 years and analysed the prevalence of CKD. Using multiple logistic regression, we investigated the association between CKD and potential risk factors such as demographic factors (age, gender, occupational status, level of education), lifestyle and behaviours (consumption of salty food, consumption of fruit and vegetables, smoking, alcohol consumption, carbonated drink consumption, physical activity), comorbid conditions (hypertension, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, hepatitis, stroke, nutritional status) and others (clean water supply, pregnancy complication, access to health care). RESULTS: We included 389 093 subjects in this study out of 713 783 subjects that participated in Riskesdas 2018 survey. The prevalence of CKD was 0.5%. The survey included mostly younger adults age 18-59 years (83.1%) with a mean (SD) age of 44.3 (15.1) years. The majority of subjects were female (60.3%), unemployed (58.4%), and the proportion of obese subject was 25.4%. Hypertension was the major comorbid condition (40.8%), while the proportion of diabetes mellitus (DM), heart disease, stroke and hepatitis were quite low (3.3%, 2.6%, 1.7% and 0.5%; respectively). Despite the high proportion of hypertension, only 36.2% of subjects did receive a prescription for anti-hypertensive medication of which only 21.7% used this medication regularly. The multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that hepatitis was the strongest risk factor of CKD (odds ratio (OR) = 3.406; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.496-4.648), exceeding the risk of CKD in patients with physical inactivity (OR = 1.236; 95% CI = 1.128-1.354), low education status (OR = 1.307; 95% CI = 1.191-1.434), male (OR = 1.527; 95% CI = 1.398-1.668), stroke (OR = 1.916; 95% CI = 1.570-2.338), heart disease (OR = 2.941; 95% CI = 2.356-3.671), and DM (OR = 2.462; 95% CI = 1.979-3.063). We also observed that DM (OR = 4.280; 95% CI = 3.756-4.876) and male subjects (OR = 1.474; 95% CI = 1.352-1.606) were identified as independent risk factors for CKD in hepatitis-positive subjects. CONCLUSIONS: This population-based survey confirmed the increasing burden of CKD in Indonesia and suggested that besides traditional metabolic risk factors, viral hepatitis has proven to be an independent risk factor for CKD in Indonesia. Furthermore, the risk of CKD is greater in male hepatitis patients with DM. The result of this study demonstrates the need for an aggressive screening program for patients with a high risk for the development of CKD. Apart from patients with traditional cardiometabolic risk factors, such a program should include patients with viral hepatitis.","Hustrini NM, Susalit E, Rotmans JI",J Glob Health,2022 Oct 14,Hypertension AND Indonesia
31955513,What is new in the 2018 Chinese hypertension guideline and the implication for the management of hypertension in Asia?,"The new Chinese hypertension guideline comprehensively covers almost all major aspects in the management of hypertension. In this new guideline, hypertension remains defined as a systolic/diastolic blood pressure of at least 140/90 mm Hg. For risk assessment, a qualitative approach is used similarly as in previous Chinese guidelines according to the blood pressure level and the presence or absence of other risk factors, target organ damage, cardiovascular complications, and comorbid diseases. The therapeutic target is 140/90 mm Hg in general, and if tolerated, especially in high-risk patients, can be more stringent, that is, 130/80 mm Hg. However, a less stringent target, that is, 150/90 mm Hg, is used in the younger (65-79 years, if tolerated, 140/90 mm Hg) and older elderly (>/=80 years). Five classes of antihypertensive drugs, including beta-blockers, can be used either in initial monotherapy or combination. The guideline also provided information on the management of hypertension in several special groups of patients and in the presence of secondary causes of hypertension. To implement the guideline recommendations, several nationwide hypertension control initiatives are being undertaken with new technology. The new technological platforms hopefully will help improve the management of hypertension and generate scientific evidence for future hypertension guidelines, including a possible Asian hypertension guideline in the near future.","Wang JG, Chia YC, Chen CH, Park S, Hoshide S, Tomitani N, Kabutoya T, Shin J, Turana Y, Soenarta AA, Tay JC, Buranakitjaroen P, Nailes J, Van Minh H, Siddique S, Sison J, Sogunuru GP, Sukonthasarn A, Teo BW, Verma N, Zhang YQ, Wang TD, Kario K",J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich),2020 Mar,Hypertension AND Indonesia
36196471,Neurodegenerative diseases and blood pressure variability: A comprehensive review from HOPE Asia.,"Asia has an enormous number of older people and is the primary contributor to the rise in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The therapy of many neurodegenerative diseases has not yet progressed to the point where it is possible to alter the course of the disease. Mid-life hypertension is an important predictor of later-life cognitive impairment and brain neurodegenerative conditions. These findings highlight the pivotal role of preventing and managing hypertension as a risk factor for neurodegenerative disease. Autonomic dysfunction, neuropsychiatric and sleep disturbances can arise in neurodegenerative diseases, resulting in blood pressure variability (BPV). The BPV itself can worsen the progression of the disease. In older people with neurodegenerative disease and hypertension, it is critical to consider 24-h blood pressure monitoring and personalized blood pressure therapy.","Turana Y, Shen R, Nathaniel M, Chia YC, Li Y, Kario K",J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich),2022 Sep,Hypertension AND Indonesia
36996045,Clinical characteristics and factors associated with COVID-19-related mortality and hospital admission during the first two epidemic waves in 5 rural provinces in Indonesia: A retrospective cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: Data on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinical characteristics and severity from resource-limited settings are limited. This study examined clinical characteristics and factors associated with COVID-19 mortality and hospitalisation in rural settings of Indonesia, from 1 January to 31 July, 2021. METHODS: This retrospective cohort included individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 based on polymerase chain reaction or rapid antigen diagnostic test, from five rural provinces in Indonesia. We extracted demographic and clinical data, including hospitalisation and mortality from a new piloted COVID-19 information system named Sistem Informasi Surveilans Epidemiologi (SISUGI). We used mixed-effect logistic regression to examine factors associated with COVID-19-related mortality and hospitalisation. RESULTS: Of 6,583 confirmed cases, 205 (3.1%) died and 1,727 (26.2%) were hospitalised. The median age was 37 years (Interquartile range 26-51), with 825 (12.6%) under 20 years, and 3,371 (51.2%) females. Most cases were symptomatic (4,533; 68.9%); 319 (4.9%) had a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia and 945 (14.3%) presented with at least one pre-existing comorbidity. Age-specific mortality rates were 0.9% (2/215) for 0-4 years; 0% (0/112) for 5-9 years; 0% (1/498) for 10-19 years; 0.8% (11/1,385) for 20-29 years; 0.9% (12/1,382) for 30-39 years; 2.1% (23/1,095) for 40-49 years; 5.4% (57/1,064) for 50-59 years; 10.8% (62/576) for 60-69 years; 15.9% (37/232) for >/=70 years. Older age, pre-existing diabetes, chronic kidney disease, liver diseases, malignancy, and pneumonia were associated with higher risk of mortality and hospitalisation. Pre-existing hypertension, cardiac diseases, COPD, and immunocompromised condition were associated with risk of hospitalisation but not with mortality. There was no association between province-level density of healthcare workers with mortality and hospitalisation. CONCLUSION: The risk of COVID-19-related mortality and hospitalisation was associated with higher age, pre-existing chronic comorbidities, and clinical pneumonia. The findings highlight the need for prioritising enhanced context-specific public health action to reduce mortality and hospitalisation risk among older and comorbid rural populations.","Surendra H, Praptiningsih CY, Ersanti AM, Rahmat M, Noviyanti W, Harmani JAD, Mansur ENA, Suleman YY, Sudrani S, Rosalina R, Mukhtar I, Rosadi D, Fauzi L, Elyazar IRF, Hawley WA, Wibisono H",PLoS One,2023,Hypertension AND Indonesia

DESIGN: A non-random cross-sectional study. SETTING: Population in 390 villages in Malang District, East Java Province, Indonesia. PARTICIPANTS: We used Malang District government COVID-19 contact tracing data from 14 264 individuals, spanning from 1 March 2020 to 29 July 2020. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome variables in this study are COVID-19 infections and COVID-19 deaths. The associations between sociodemographic characteristics and health access of COVID-19 infection and death were analysed using multilevel logistic regression. RESULTS: Among the 14 264 samples, 551 individuals were confirmed as being infected with COVID-19; 62 individuals died of COVID-19. Women, individuals with direct contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases and individuals with hypertension constituted the groups most vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. Among respondents with confirmed COVID-19 cases, men, individuals aged 61 years and older, individuals with hypertension, and those diagnosed with pneumonia and respiratory failure were at higher risk of death. The number of community-based healthcare interventions was significantly associated with lower COVID-19 infection and COVID-19 mortality. Greater distance to a COVID-19 referral hospital increased risk of COVID-19 mortality. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 infection and death were related not only to sociodemographic characteristics of individuals but also to the presence of community-based healthcare interventions and access to hospital care. Strategies in public health, including improving healthcare access, are required to reduce COVID-19 infections among the most susceptible groups in Indonesia.","Sujarwoto S, Maharani A",BMJ Open,2022 May 24,Hypertension AND Indonesia
35437244,Applying systems thinking to identify enablers and challenges to scale-up interventions for hypertension and diabetes in low-income and middle-income countries: protocol for a longitudinal mixed-methods study.,"INTRODUCTION: There is an urgent need to reduce the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), particularly in low-and middle-income countries, where the greatest burden lies. Yet, there is little research concerning the specific issues involved in scaling up NCD interventions targeting low-resource settings. We propose to examine this gap in up to 27 collaborative projects, which were funded by the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases (GACD) 2019 Scale Up Call, reflecting a total funding investment of approximately US$50 million. These projects represent diverse countries, contexts and adopt varied approaches and study designs to scale-up complex, evidence-based interventions to improve hypertension and diabetes outcomes. A systematic inquiry of these projects will provide necessary scientific insights into the enablers and challenges in the scale up of complex NCD interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will apply systems thinking (a holistic approach to analyse the inter-relationship between constituent parts of scaleup interventions and the context in which the interventions are implemented) and adopt a longitudinal mixed-methods study design to explore the planning and early implementation phases of scale up projects. Data will be gathered at three time periods, namely, at planning (T(P)), initiation of implementation (T(0)) and 1-year postinitiation (T(1)). We will extract project-related data from secondary documents at T(P) and conduct multistakeholder qualitative interviews to gather data at T(0) and T(1.) We will undertake descriptive statistical analysis of T(P) data and analyse T(0) and T(1) data using inductive thematic coding. The data extraction tool and interview guides were developed based on a literature review of scale-up frameworks. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The current protocol was approved by the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC number 23482). Informed consent will be obtained from all participants.

From previous studies, about 1%-3% of hypertensive individuals experienced hypertensive emergencies. Its prevalence varied by country and region throughout Asia. Asian populations have more different biological and cultural backgrounds than Caucasians and even within Asian countries. However, there is a scarcity of research on clinical features, treatment, and outcomes in multinational Asian populations. The authors aimed to review the current evidence about epidemiology, clinical characteristics and outcomes, and practice guidelines in Asia. Five observational studies and nine clinical practice guidelines across Asia were reviewed. The prevalence of hypertensive emergencies ranged from .1% to 1.5%. Stroke was the most common target organ involvement in Asians who presented with hypertensive emergencies. Although most hypertensive emergency patients required hospitalization, the mortality rate was low. Given the current lack of data among Asian countries, a multinational data repository and Asian guidelines on hypertensive emergency management are mandatory.","Kotruchin P, Tangpaisarn T, Mitsungnern T, Sukonthasarn A, Hoshide S, Turana Y, Siddique S, Buranakitjaroen P, Van Huynh M, Chia YC, Park S, Chen CH, Nailes J, Tay JC, Wang JG, Kario K",J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich),2022 Sep,Hypertension AND Indonesia

38683749,"Association between the severity of hard-to-treat psoriasis and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome: A hospital-based cross-sectional study in Jakarta, Indonesia.","Psoriatic lesions on the scalp, face, intertriginous, genitals, palms/soles, and nails are often delay diagnosed, hard-to-treat, and cause disability. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is one of the most frequent and significant comorbidities in psoriasis. Many studies have discovered a link between psoriasis and MetS, but none have specifically assessed the hard-to-treat psoriasis in Indonesian population. This is a multicenter study involving four dermatology referral hospitals to investigate the association between psoriasis severity that has hard-to-treat lesions with the prevalence of MetS in Jakarta, Indonesia. Data was collected from April to October 2022. The severity of 84 hard-to-treat psoriasis patients was measured by Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) scores. The participants divided into PASI score >10 (severe) and </= 10 (mild-moderate) groups. MetS was identified based on the modified National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III. MetS was found in 64.3% of patients. Patients with a PASI score>10 had a significantly higher risk of metabolic syndrome compared to those with a score </= 10 (78.6% vs 50%, OR 3.667; 95% CI 1.413-9.514; p = 0.006). The prevalence of hypertension (p = 0.028), low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (p = 0.01), mean fasting blood sugar (p = 0.018), and triglyceride levels (p = 0.044) between the two groups differed significantly. This study found most frequent components of MetS were abdominal obesity, decreased levels of HDL cholesterol, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and hypertriglyceridemia respectively. Individuals with severe hard-to-treat psoriasis had a 3.67 times more likely to have MetS rather than the mild-moderate group.","Evyana D, Novianto E, Budianti WK, Krisanti RIA, Wisnu W, Wibawanti R, Nilasari H, Legiawati L, Hapsari SAR, Mutmainnah E",PLoS One,2024,Hypertension AND Indonesia
31056152,Maternal and perinatal outcome related to severity of chronic hypertension in pregnancy.,"OBJECTIVES: Chronic hypertension in pregnancy is an important cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of severity of chronic hypertension in pregnancy on maternal and perinatal outcome in an Indonesian population. STUDY DESIGN: This study was performed in Dr Soetomo General Hospital, a tertiary center in East - Java, Indonesia over the period of 2013-2017. Chronic hypertension (CH) was divided using JNC VII criteria, as stage 1 (Blood pressure >/=140/90 mmHg) and Stage 2 (BP > 160/110 mmHg) hypertension. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were maternal and perinatal outcome. Data was statistically analyzed using Chi-square, Fischer exact test, and Mann-Whitney test (program: SPSS (R)23). RESULTS: Over these 5 years, 352 patients were diagnosed with CH. The stage 2 of CH was associated with worse maternal outcome: maternal death (5.6% vs 0.8%; p = 0.016), laboratory values of urinary protein +3 (67% vs 21,5%, p = 0.001) and +4 (12.3% vs 0.4%, p = 0.001), LDH > 600 IU/L (11.3% vs 5.3%, p = 0.04), ALT > 70 IU/L (11.3% vs 4.1%, p = 0.01), AST > 70 IU/L (12.3% vs 5.3%, p = 0.02), BUN > 25 mg/dL (27.4% vs 8.1%, p = 0.001), SK > 1.1 mg/dL (29.2% vs 6.5%, p = 0.001) and Albumin <3 g/dL (65.1% vs 10.2%, p = 0.001), need for ICU admission (76.4% vs 36.6%, p = 0.001), mechanical ventilation (48.1% vs 21.1%, p = 0.001), and occurrence of complications (72.6% vs 57.7%, p = 0.006). Stage 2 CH in pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of maternal death (OR: 7.22; 95% CI: 1.43-36.36; p = 0,016). Stage 2 CH was also associated with worse perinatal outcome, in terms of lower birth weight (1635 +/- 863.27 vs 2063.74 +/- 935.43, p = 0.001), lower Apgar score (p = 0.001), and number of intra uterine complications such as: IUGR, stillbirth, and placental abruption (27.4% vs 11.8%, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Stage 2 CH in pregnancy is associated with worse maternal and perinatal outcomes compared with stage 1.

39304265,"Global, regional, and national burden of stroke and its risk factors, 1990-2021: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.","BACKGROUND: Up-to-date estimates of stroke burden and attributable risks and their trends at global, regional, and national levels are essential for evidence-based health care, prevention, and resource allocation planning. We aimed to provide such estimates for the period 1990-2021. METHODS: We estimated incidence, prevalence, death, and disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) counts and age-standardised rates per 100 000 people per year for overall stroke, ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, and subarachnoid haemorrhage, for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. We also calculated burden of stroke attributable to 23 risk factors and six risk clusters (air pollution, tobacco smoking, behavioural, dietary, environmental, and metabolic risks) at the global and regional levels (21 GBD regions and Socio-demographic Index [SDI] quintiles), using the standard GBD methodology. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for each individual future estimate were derived from the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of distributions generated from propagating 500 draws through the multistage computational pipeline. FINDINGS: In 2021, stroke was the third most common GBD level 3 cause of death (7.3 million [95% UI 6.6-7.8] deaths; 10.7% [9.8-11.3] of all deaths) after ischaemic heart disease and COVID-19, and the fourth most common cause of DALYs (160.5 million [147.8-171.6] DALYs; 5.6% [5.0-6.1] of all DALYs). In 2021, there were 93.8 million (89.0-99.3) prevalent and 11.9 million (10.7-13.2) incident strokes. We found disparities in stroke burden and risk factors by GBD region, country or territory, and SDI, as well as a stagnation in the reduction of incidence from 2015 onwards, and even some increases in the stroke incidence, death, prevalence, and DALY rates in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania, countries with lower SDI, and people younger than 70 years. Globally, ischaemic stroke constituted 65.3% (62.4-67.7), intracerebral haemorrhage constituted 28.8% (28.3-28.8), and subarachnoid haemorrhage constituted 5.8% (5.7-6.0) of incident strokes. There were substantial increases in DALYs attributable to high BMI (88.2% [53.4-117.7]), high ambient temperature (72.4% [51.1 to 179.5]), high fasting plasma glucose (32.1% [26.7-38.1]), diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages (23.4% [12.7-35.7]), low physical activity (11.3% [1.8-34.9]), high systolic blood pressure (6.7% [2.5-11.6]), lead exposure (6.5% [4.5-11.2]), and diet low in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (5.3% [0.5-10.5]). INTERPRETATION: Stroke burden has increased from 1990 to 2021, and the contribution of several risk factors has also increased.

38528854,Endovascular Thrombectomy for Acute Ischemic Stroke in Indonesia: Challenging and Strategic Planning.,"High rates of morbidity and mortality indicate that stroke is a major health concern. Unfortunately, the management of ischemic stroke is hindered by several obstacles, particularly in developing countries such as Indonesia, where the burden of morbidity and mortality remains high. In this literature review, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and analysis of the obstacles to stroke thrombectomy in developing countries, with a focus on Indonesia. Even though numerous studies and recent advances in thrombectomy techniques have been developed, many centers around the world continue to struggle to implement them. The majority of these institutions are located in developing nations like Indonesia. It faces numerous obstacles, including a lack of public awareness, infrastructure, human resources, and financial difficulties. The absence of early education and large-scale campaigns contributes to the dearth of public awareness. Inadequate imaging facilities, prehospital and referral systems, as well as disparities in healthcare expenditure and accessibility, contribute to the absence of infrastructure. Inadequate numbers of neurointerventionists, neurologists, and neurosurgeons, as well as a disparate distribution of these professionals, contribute to human resource issues. Inadequate national insurance coverage, high import tariffs on medical devices, and the high cost of healthcare have a negative impact on the financial situation. We provide related strategies regarding the current situation in Indonesia based on the recent evidence and comparison with developed countries.

34182555,"The Burden of Dementia due to Down Syndrome, Parkinson's Disease, Stroke, and Traumatic Brain Injury: A Systematic Analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.","BACKGROUND: In light of the increasing trend in the global number of individuals affected by dementia and the lack of any available disease-modifying therapies, it is necessary to fully understand and quantify the global burden of dementia. This work aimed to estimate the proportion of dementia due to Down syndrome, Parkinson's disease, clinical stroke, and traumatic brain injury (TBI), globally and by world region, in order to better understand the contribution of clinical diseases to dementia prevalence. METHODS: Through literature review, we obtained data on the relative risk of dementia with each condition and estimated relative risks by age using a Bayesian meta-regression tool. We then calculated population attributable fractions (PAFs), or the proportion of dementia attributable to each condition, using the estimates of relative risk and prevalence estimates for each condition from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. Finally, we multiplied these estimates by dementia prevalence to calculate the number of dementia cases attributable to each condition. FINDINGS: For each clinical condition, the relative risk of dementia decreased with age. Relative risks were highest for Down syndrome, followed by Parkinson's disease, stroke, and TBI. However, due to the high prevalence of stroke, the PAF for dementia due to stroke was highest. Together, Down syndrome, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and TBI explained 10.0% (95% UI: 6.0-16.5) of the global prevalence of dementia. INTERPRETATION: Ten percent of dementia prevalence globally could be explained by Down syndrome, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and TBI. The quantification of the proportion of dementia attributable to these 4 conditions constitutes a small contribution to our overall understanding of what causes dementia. However, epidemiological research into modifiable risk factors as well as basic science research focused on elucidating intervention approaches to prevent or delay the neuropathological changes that commonly characterize dementia will be critically important in future efforts to prevent and treat disease.",No authors listed,Neuroepidemiology,2021,Stroke AND Indonesia

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study using actor-partner interdependence model. METHODS: We recruited 183 dyads of stroke survivors and their family caregivers in Indonesia. The World Health Organization Disability Assessment (WHODAS 2.0), Depression, Anxiety and Stress (DASS-42) and Rand Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) were used to measure disability, depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms and QoL of stroke survivors and family caregivers. The actor-partner interdependence model was tested using multilevel modelling. The actor-partner interdependence mediation model (APIMeM) was applied to estimate the direct and indirect effect. RESULTS: Disability had actor effects on stroke survivor's overall QoL and partner effect on family caregiver's overall QoL. More severe disability of stroke survivors was associated with a lower overall QoL of their own and that of family caregiver's overall QoL. Depressive symptoms of stroke survivors had actor effects on stroke survivors' overall QoL and partner effects on family caregivers' overall QoL. Actor and partner effects also exist on family caregiver's depression symptoms to their own overall QoL and stroke survivor's overall QoL. Moreover, higher anxiety symptoms were associated with lower levels of their own and partner's overall QoL in both stroke survivors and family caregivers. Stroke survivor's stress symptoms also negatively associated with their own and family caregiver's overall QoL. However, a family caregiver's stress without a partner effects on stroke survivor's overall QoL. The APIMeM analysis showed that disability of stroke survivors directly decreased their own overall, physical (PCS) and mental QoL (MCS). Also, disability mediated by stroke survivor's depression, anxiety and stress symptoms decreased both stroke survivor's and family caregiver's physical (PCS) and mental QoL (MCS). CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that stroke survivors and family caregivers may influence each other during the caregiving process and social life. The disability of stroke survivors, and the depression, anxiety and stress symptoms of stroke survivors and family caregivers affect their own QoL and their partners' QoL. Disability of stroke survivors directly decreased their own overall, physical (PCS) and mental QoL (MCS). Also, it indirectly via stroke survivor's depression, anxiety and stress symptoms decreased both stroke survivor's and family caregiver's physical (PCS) and mental QoL (MCS). IMPACT: Dyadic actor-partner interdependence models have shown promising potential to predict the QoL among patients and family caregivers. The dyadic effects of disability, depression, anxiety and stress symptoms on the QoL of stroke survivors and family caregivers can be applied to guide the future development of nursing intervention addressed decreasing depression, anxiety and stress symptoms to optimize health outcomes among stroke survivors and their family caregivers.","Yuliana S, Yu E, Rias YA, Atikah N, Chang HJ, Tsai HT",J Adv Nurs,2023 Jan,Stroke AND Indonesia
35186263,"Roles and Problems of Stroke Caregivers: A Qualitative Study in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.","Background: Caregivers play a central role in post-stroke patients' care. However, the role of and problems managed by caregivers have not been widely studied, particularly in Indonesia. This study aims to explore the roles and problems of caregivers in post- stroke patients' care. Method: This was a qualitative study. Seven caregivers of post-stroke patients from the homecare clinic of Dr Sardjito General Hospital were purposely selected during January 2017 to June 2018. Focus group discussions were conducted to explore the roles and problems of caregiving. Results: Themes related to caregivers' roles were: connecting patients with medical personnel and other family members, maintaining patients' health conditions by fulfilling basic needs and assisting rehabilitation, as well as maintaining patients' psychological conditions by encouraging conversation, telling jokes, or recreation. On the other hand, themes related to caregivers' problems were: lack of knowledge caused by education inadequacy, underappreciated and unconcerned family, suboptimal service including limited physiotherapy and pharmacy resource, unthorough administration, lack of communication, physical limitations, and burnout, as well as uncooperative patients. Conclusions: Caregivers play essential roles as communicators and help to maintain patient's health conditions. Common problems are related to a lack of knowledge about strokes and a lack of attention from family. Further research to study the effects of these findings on the quality of life of both patient and their caregiver, as well as how to handle the caregiver issues should be investigated.","Muhrodji P, Wicaksono HDA, Satiti S, Trisnantoro L, Setyopranoto I, Vidyanti AN",F1000Res,2021,Stroke AND Indonesia
40074251,Factors associated with prehospital and in-hospital delays in acute ischaemic stroke care in Indonesia: a systematic review.,"OBJECTIVES: This systematic review examines prehospital and in-hospital delays in acute stroke care in Indonesia. DESIGN: Systematic review adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. DATA SOURCES: We conducted a thorough search across 11 databases, ClinicalTrials.gov registries and three preprint repositories up until October 2024. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies that examined risk variables associated with hospital delays in the treatment of acute stroke in Indonesian individuals were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers each carried out the data extraction and risk-of-bias evaluation separately. The quality of the study was evaluated using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies of Exposures tool. The 'combining p values' approach and albatross plots were used to synthesise the findings. RESULTS: A total of 27 studies with 3610 patients were included. Key factors contributing to prehospital delays included low educational level (p=0.014, 6 studies), low socioeconomic status (p=0.003, 5 studies), cultural beliefs affecting decision-making (p<0.001, 3 studies), significant clinical manifestations such as a low Glasgow Coma Scale score (<8) (p<0.001, 2 studies) and a high National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (>16) (p=0.002, 5 studies) and transportation challenges, such as extended travel distance (>15 km) (p=0.009, 5 studies) and lack of ambulance use (p=0.005, 9 studies). In-hospital delays were prominent, with male sex (p=0.046), dyslipidaemia (p=0.045) and arrival time (p=0.007) linked to thrombolysis delays, while CT location affected door-to-CT time (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Socioeconomic, cultural, clinical severity and logistical factors were significantly associated with hospital delays in acute ischaemic stroke care in Indonesia. Targeted interventions can mitigate these challenges and improve stroke management and results.

34299999,Economic Burden of Stroke Disease: A Systematic Review.,"Globally, one of the main causes of non-communicable disease as a cause of death every year is stroke. The objective of this study was to analyze the burden in consequence of stroke. This research used a systematic review method. Furthermore, a search for articles was carried out in June-July 2020. Four databases were used to search articles from 2015 to 2020. Eligible studies were identified, analyzed, and reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The inclusion criteria were prospective cost studies, retrospective cost studies, database analysis, mathematical models, surveys, and COI studies that assess burden of stroke in primary and referral healthcare (hospital-based). The results showed that from four databases, 9270 articles were obtained, and 13 articles were qualified. A total of 9270 articles had the identified search keywords, but only 13 articles met the set criteria for inclusion. The criteria for inclusion were stroke patients, the economic burden of stroke disease based on cost of illness method, which is approximately equal to USD 1809.51-325,108.84 (direct costs 86.2%, and indirect costs 13.8%). Those that used the health expenditure method did not present the total cost; instead, only either direct or indirect cost of health expenditure were reported. For most hospital admissions due to stroke, LOS (length of stay) was the dominant cost. The high economic burden to manage stroke justifies the promotion and preventive efforts by the policymakers and motivates the practice of healthy lifestyles by the people.","Rochmah TN, Rahmawati IT, Dahlui M, Budiarto W, Bilqis N",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2021 Jul 15,Stroke AND Indonesia
35695400,Clopidogrel Resistance Among Ischemic Stroke Patients and Its Risk Factors in Indonesia.,"OBJECTIVE: Clopidogrel is a common antiplatelet used as secondary prevention of ischemic stroke, known to have better efficacy than aspirin, with a equivalent safety profile. However, clopidogrel resistance is not uncommon but has not been widely studied in Asia. This study will further assess clopidogrel resistance and its risk factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at Rumah Sakit Universitas, Indonesia, and Rumah Sakit Cipto Mangunkusumo, Indonesia in 2020-2021. All patients had had at least one episode of ischemic stroke. Clopidogrel resistance was assessed using a VerifyNow assay. RESULTS: 57 subjects were enrolled in this study. We found 15.8% of subjects were clopidogrel resistant. Gender was significantly associated with clopidogrel resistance, with males having 80% lower clopidogrel resistance (OR 0.2 (95% CI 0.022 - 0.638); P=0.006). Meanwhile, smoking was not associated with clopidogrel responsiveness (P=0.051). We found no association between haemoglobin, blood glucose, HbA1c, cholesterol, liver enzymes, serum urea concentration or creatinine levels and clopidogrel resistance. CONCLUSION: Clopidogrel remains an effective treatment to prevent recurrent ischemic stroke in Indonesia. Further studies are needed to assess gene polymorphism and clopidogrel resistance, which may explain the findings of this study.","Hidayat R, Nabilah RA, Rasyid A, Harris S, Harahap AR, Herqutanto H, Louisa M, Listyaningsih E, Rambe AS, Loho T",Acta Med Acad,2022 Apr,Stroke AND Indonesia
35449795,"Awareness of Being at Risk of Stroke and Its Determinant Factors among Hypertensive Patients in Banyumas, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: The global burden of stroke is still high, particularly in developing countries, with hypertension serving as the main risk factor. The awareness of stroke among hypertensive patients is crucial for stroke prevention. This study was aimed at identifying the awareness of being at risk of stroke and its determinant factors among hypertensive patients in Banyumas, Indonesia. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in Primary Health Centers (PHCs) in Banyumas Regency, Indonesia, from April to August 2019. A simple random sampling technique was used to select the representatives' PHCs. Hypertensive patients who came regularly to the PHCs were consecutively recruited. Data were collected through a self-reported questionnaire and medical records. The main outcome was the level of participants' awareness of being at risk of stroke. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to measure determinant factors associated with the level of awareness. RESULTS: Out of 457 patients investigated, 77.46% had a low level of awareness. Low knowledge of hypertension, low income, and no history of previous stroke were associated with a low-level of awareness (odds ratio (OR) 1.942, 95% CI 1.195-3.158, p 0.007; OR 2.321, 95% CI 1.326-4.064, p 0.003; and OR 6.033, 95% CI 2.450-14.858, p < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Majority of hypertensive patients were unaware of being at risk of stroke. Knowledge of hypertension, income, and history of previous stroke are factors that may influence the awareness of being at risk of stroke among them. This emphasizes the need to provide better campaigns and education programs to raise the awareness of stroke in a community setting, particularly for the population at risk.","Setyopranoto I, Upoyo AS, Isworo A, Sari Y, Vidyanti AN",Stroke Res Treat,2022,Stroke AND Indonesia
37950166,Body Mass Index Asian populations category and stroke and heart disease in the adult population: a longitudinal study of the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS) 2007 and 2014.,"BACKGROUND: A substantially elevated Body Mass Index (BMI) is one of the largest global modifiable risk factors for stroke and heart diseases. Most studies classify BMI according to the WHO BMI cut-off point in stroke and heart disease studies. However, there is a limited understanding of the association between the BMI cut-off point in the Asian population category and stroke and heart disease. This study aimed to investigate the incidence rate ratio of stroke and heart disease by BMI categories for the Asian population. METHODS: A 7-year prospective longitudinal study (2007-2014) was conducted on 6,688 adult Indonesian individuals (>/= 35 years) residing across 13 different provinces in Indonesia during the survey periods. Data on BMI were collected in 2007. Information on stroke and heart disease was obtained in both 2007 and in 2014. A multivariate-adjusted Poisson regression model was used to estimate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of either stroke or heart disease or both stroke and heart disease by BMI. RESULTS: Among the 6,688 eligible participants, 334 (5%) were judged as stroke and heart disease in 2014. The IRR (95% CI) of stroke and heart disease for participants with obesity was 2.57 (1.64-4.04) compared with those within normal weight. This incidence rate ratio was more pronounced among middle-aged adults (< 55 years) rather than the older adults (>/=55 years).The IRR of stroke and heart disease among obese middle-aged adults was 4.18 (95% CI 2.10-8.31). CONCLUSIONS: An association was observed between obesity and the risk of stroke and heart disease, especially in middle-aged adults. These findings suggest that lowering BMI through the adoption of healthy dietary habits and increasing physical activity, particularly among middle-aged adults with high education, occupational employment, and residence in either urban or rural areas, may be beneficial for preventing stroke and heart disease.","Latief K, Nurrika D, Tsai MK, Gao W",BMC Public Health,2023 Nov 10,Stroke AND Indonesia
36257718,Global Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Stroke Volumes and Cerebrovascular Events: A 1-Year Follow-up.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Declines in stroke admission, IV thrombolysis (IVT), and mechanical thrombectomy volumes were reported during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a paucity of data on the longer-term effect of the pandemic on stroke volumes over the course of a year and through the second wave of the pandemic. We sought to measure the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the volumes of stroke admissions, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), IVT, and mechanical thrombectomy over a 1-year period at the onset of the pandemic (March 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021) compared with the immediately preceding year (March 1, 2019, to February 29, 2020). METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal retrospective study across 6 continents, 56 countries, and 275 stroke centers. We collected volume data for COVID-19 admissions and 4 stroke metrics: ischemic stroke admissions, ICH admissions, IVT treatments, and mechanical thrombectomy procedures. Diagnoses were identified by their ICD-10 codes or classifications in stroke databases. RESULTS: There were 148,895 stroke admissions in the 1 year immediately before compared with 138,453 admissions during the 1-year pandemic, representing a 7% decline (95% CI [95% CI 7.1-6.9]; p < 0.0001). ICH volumes declined from 29,585 to 28,156 (4.8% [5.1-4.6]; p < 0.0001) and IVT volume from 24,584 to 23,077 (6.1% [6.4-5.8]; p < 0.0001). Larger declines were observed at high-volume compared with low-volume centers (all p < 0.0001). There was no significant change in mechanical thrombectomy volumes (0.7% [0.6-0.9]; p = 0.49). Stroke was diagnosed in 1.3% [1.31-1.38] of 406,792 COVID-19 hospitalizations. SARS-CoV-2 infection was present in 2.9% ([2.82-2.97], 5,656/195,539) of all stroke hospitalizations. DISCUSSION: There was a global decline and shift to lower-volume centers of stroke admission volumes, ICH volumes, and IVT volumes during the 1st year of the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the prior year. Mechanical thrombectomy volumes were preserved. These results suggest preservation in the stroke care of higher severity of disease through the first pandemic year.

31186829,"Prevalence of Stroke and Associated Risk Factors in Sleman District of Yogyakarta Special Region, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: Stroke remains one of the most common noncommunicable diseases among Indonesian populations. This study aimed to identify the prevalence of stroke and its associated risk factors in the Sleman District of Yogyakarta Special Region, Indonesia. METHOD: This study was a secondary analysis of community-based data collected by the Sleman Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) in 2016. Basic demographic and socioeconomic data were collected. Additional questions about history of stroke and other chronic diseases were interviewed as a self-reported diagnosis. History of hormonal contraceptives use and dietary patterns were also collected. We examined the association between the prevalence of stroke and risk factors, namely, age, gender, self-reported history of chronic diseases, hormonal contraceptives use, and high-risk dietary patterns. RESULTS: The survey included 4,996 households composed of 20,465 individuals. Data regarding stroke incidents were available from 13,605 subjects aged >/=20 years old. Among them, a total of 4,884 subjects also have data regarding stroke risk factors. The overall prevalence of stroke in Sleman District was 1.4% (0.5% men and 0.90% women). The prevalence increased with additional decades of age (p<0.001). In a multivariable model, increasing age, self-reported history of hypertension (OR=8.37, 95%CI: 4.76 to 14.69), and self-reported history of diabetes mellitus (OR=2.87, 95%CI: 1.54 to 5.35) were significantly associated with stroke. CONCLUSIONS: A community-based survey in Indonesia showed a high prevalence of stroke which was associated with increasing age, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. These findings suggest that preventive actions against the aforementioned modifiable risk factors should be prioritized.","Setyopranoto I, Bayuangga HF, Panggabean AS, Alifaningdyah S, Lazuardi L, Dewi FST, Malueka RG",Stroke Res Treat,2019,Stroke AND Indonesia
39533715,Occurrence of stroke in children and young adults in Indonesia: a multicenter private hospital study.,"BACKGROUND: Most studies that estimate the occurrence of childhood stroke use heterogeneous methods and rely on International Classification of Diseases codes, a strategy that may be unreliable. PURPOSE: This study aimed to estimate the occurrence of childhood stroke in Indonesia using imaging and clinical data from a private hospital network. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used consecutive retrospective multicenter data samples collected in 2019- 2023. The study cohort included children aged >28 days to young adults aged 24 years with confirmed ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The 1-year occurrence was calculated, and the data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics ver. 26.0. RESULTS: Over 5 years, the performance of 8,987 CT and 6,133 MRI scans resulted in the identification of 1,074 stroke cases. The average patient age was 14.8+/-7.0 years. Stroke occurrence was highest in 2021 (9.08%) and lowest in 2022 (5.91%). Male patients accounted for 67.9% of cases, with hemorrhagic strokes accounting for 83.4% of the total, primarily resulting from accidents (73.2%) and predominantly occurring in the frontal region (37.1%). A significant majority of cases (66.7%) were reported in Java. Males had a relative risk of 1.93 (95% confidence interval, 1.48-2.52; P<0.001) for hemorrhagic stroke versus females. CONCLUSION: The incidence of childhood stroke revealed critical epidemiological trends and disparities, emphasizing the need for targeted public health interventions and enhanced stroke prevention strategies in Indonesia.","Leman J, Sungono V, Haryono YT, Mudzakir MA, Rahmawati DL, Sulay CBH, Octavius GS",Clin Exp Pediatr,2025 Apr,Stroke AND Indonesia
29037005,"Stroke Epidemiology in South, East, and South-East Asia: A Review.","Asia, which holds 60% of the world's population, comprises some developing countries which are in economic transition. This paper reviews the epidemiology of stroke in South, East and South-East Asia. Data on the epidemiology of stroke in South, East, and South-East Asia were derived from the Global Burden of Disease study (mortality, disability-adjusted life-years [DALYs] lost because of stroke), World Health Organization (vascular risk factors in the community), and publications in PubMed (incidence, prevalence, subtypes, vascular risk factors among hospitalized stroke patients). Age- and sex-standardized mortality is the lowest in Japan, and highest in Mongolia. Community-based incidence data of only a few countries are available, with the lowest rates being observed in Malaysia, and the highest in Japan and Taiwan. The availability of prevalence data is higher than incidence data, but different study methods were used for case-finding, with different age bands. For DALYs, Japan has the lowest rates, and Mongolia the highest. For community, a high prevalence of hypertension is seen in Mongolia and Pakistan; diabetes mellitus in Papua New Guinea, Pakistan, and Mongolia; hypercholesterolemia in Japan, Singapore, and Brunei; inactivity in Malaysia; obesity in Brunei, Papua New Guinea, and Mongolia; tobacco smoking in Indonesia. Hypertension is the most frequent risk factor, followed by diabetes mellitus and smoking. Ischemic stroke occurs more frequently than hemorrhagic stroke, and subarachnoid hemorrhages are uncommon. There are variations in the stroke epidemiology between countries in South, East, and South-East Asia. Further research on stroke burden is required.","Venketasubramanian N, Yoon BW, Pandian J, Navarro JC",J Stroke,2017 Sep,Stroke AND Indonesia
40012599,Prevalence of atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke and associated risk factors: A hospital-based study in Indonesia.,"CONTEXT: The prevalence of ischemic stroke increases each year. One such important factor is the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF), but data regarding this are scarce in Indonesia. AIMS: This study aimed to understand the prevalence of AF in ischemic stroke and its associated risk factors. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted from January 2021 to 2023 in Fatima Hospital, through medical records. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Subjects were ischemic stroke patients aged >/=18 years. Additional data included demographic characteristics, congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, stroke history, vascular disease, AF, dyslipidemia, Glasgow Coma Scale, and anticoagulant usage. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Data were analyzed using Chi-square, Fisher, Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney, and logistic regression. RESULTS: Out of 148 subjects, AF was detected in 16 (10.8%). Among these, 14 (87.5%) had a CHA2DS2-VASc score of >/=2 and were given anticoagulant therapy. A higher proportion of subjects aged over 75 years was observed in the AF group (31.2% vs. 3.8%; P < 0.001). A similar pattern was seen with CHF and dyslipidemia (CHF: 56.3% vs. 8.3%; P < 0.000; dyslipidemia: 93.7% vs. 58.3%; P < 0.005). CHF and dyslipidemia increased the risk of AF by 27-fold (P = 0.001, odds ratio [OR]: 27.400) and 21-fold (P = 0.013, OR: 21.812), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the importance of vigilant screening for AF in ischemic stroke, particularly in patients with CHF and dyslipidemia, to guide appropriate anticoagulation therapy and reduce the risk of recurrent stroke. This study was limited by its single-center design and small sample size. A larger, multicenter study is recommended.","Nathan TA, Wibowo R, Sasongkojati R, Hartoko B, Butarbutar DT",Brain Circ,2024 Oct-Dec,Stroke AND Indonesia
33766997,Global Impact of COVID-19 on Stroke Care and IV Thrombolysis.,"OBJECTIVE: To measure the global impact of COVID-19 pandemic on volumes of IV thrombolysis (IVT), IVT transfers, and stroke hospitalizations over 4 months at the height of the pandemic (March 1 to June 30, 2020) compared with 2 control 4-month periods. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, observational, retrospective study across 6 continents, 70 countries, and 457 stroke centers. Diagnoses were identified by their ICD-10 codes or classifications in stroke databases. RESULTS: There were 91,373 stroke admissions in the 4 months immediately before compared to 80,894 admissions during the pandemic months, representing an 11.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] -11.7 to -11.3, p < 0.0001) decline. There were 13,334 IVT therapies in the 4 months preceding compared to 11,570 procedures during the pandemic, representing a 13.2% (95% CI -13.8 to -12.7, p < 0.0001) drop. Interfacility IVT transfers decreased from 1,337 to 1,178, or an 11.9% decrease (95% CI -13.7 to -10.3, p = 0.001). Recovery of stroke hospitalization volume (9.5%, 95% CI 9.2-9.8, p < 0.0001) was noted over the 2 later (May, June) vs the 2 earlier (March, April) pandemic months. There was a 1.48% stroke rate across 119,967 COVID-19 hospitalizations. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was noted in 3.3% (1,722/52,026) of all stroke admissions. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a global decline in the volume of stroke hospitalizations, IVT, and interfacility IVT transfers. Primary stroke centers and centers with higher COVID-19 inpatient volumes experienced steeper declines.

33124676,"Knowledge of stroke and medication adherence among patients with recurrent stroke or transient ischemic attack in Indonesia: a multi-center, cross-sectional study.","BackgroundThere is a limited data in Indonesia regarding the stroke knowledge and medication adherence among stroke survivors.ObjectiveTo assess the level of stroke knowledge and medication adherence along with their relationship among stroke survivors.SettingTwo tertiary-care hospitals in Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia.MethodsA prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted among 215 stroke survivors. Stroke Knowledge Test and the Morisky Green Levine Adherence Scale questionnaires were used to evaluate stroke knowledge and medication adherence, respectively. Binary logistic regression was performed to assess the rela tionship between stroke knowledge and medication adherence. Main outcome measuresRelationship between stroke knowledge and medication adherence.ResultsA total of 215 patients with mean age of 56.34 +/- 8.69 years were recruited into this study. Mean Stroke Knowledge Test score was 7.89 +/- 3.38 with 76.7% had low level of stroke knowledge. Mean Morisky Green Levine Adherence Scale was 3.05 +/- 1.11 with 52.1% had low to medium medication adherence. Education and duration of stroke correlated with stroke knowledge level (Spearman's correlation coefficient: 0.307, p = 0.001 and 0.128, p = 0.041, respectively). Age and disability correlated with medication adherence (Spearman's correlation coefficient: 0.169; p = 0.013 and 0.171; p = 0.012), respectively. After adjustment for covariates, stroke knowledge level was independently associated with medication adherence (adjusted OR: 4.37, 95% CI 2.00-9.53; p < 0.001).ConclusionStroke knowledge was low among Indonesian stroke survivors and independently related to medication adherence. Attempts should be made to increase stroke knowledge which may improve medication adherence among stroke survivors.","Widjaja KK, Chulavatnatol S, Suansanae T, Wibowo YI, Sani AF, Islamiyah WR, Nathisuwan S",Int J Clin Pharm,2021 Jun,Stroke AND Indonesia
38641005,Knowledge and awareness of stroke in rural and urban communities.,"INTRODUCTION: The average stroke morbidity rate, especially in rural communities, is higher when compared to the national average. OBJECTIVE: Identify the profile of knowledge and awareness of stroke in rural and urban communities and analyze the differences between the two. METHOD: Respondents who met the requirements answered a questionnaire containing a total of 41 items regarding knowledge and awareness of stroke. Characteristic data obtained includes age, gender, education, occupation, and ethnicity. Differences in characteristics were analyzed using Mann-Whitney, and the profiles of knowledge and awareness of stroke in rural and urban groups were analyzed using independent t tests to see differences between the two. RESULT: Differences in the characteristics of rural and urban groups were only in education (p = 0.036) and occupation (p = 0.021). The mean score of the knowledge domain for the rural group was 72.53 (SD = 11.04), for the urban group it was 81.06 (SD = 11.12). The mean score awareness of stroke domain in the rural group was 72.18 (SD = 11.01), the urban group was 85.51 (SD = 11.67). The profile of knowledge and awareness of stroke in rural communities was significantly lower than in urban communities. The significance value was (p = 0.004) for knowledge and (p = 0.002) for awareness of stroke. CONCLUSION: Based on the findings, it is reasonable to suspect that educational and occupational factors contribute to differences in the profile of knowledge and awareness of stroke in the two groups. Therefore, the stroke awareness campaign strategy for rural communities needs to be specifically designed by emphasizing/considering educational and occupational factors.","Ambarika R, Said MSM, Adiutama NM, Anggraini NA, Poddar S, Abdullah BF",Enferm Clin (Engl Ed),2024 May-Jun,Stroke AND Indonesia
32843830,Fibrinogen and LDL Influence on Blood Viscosity and Outcome of Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: To assess the role of risk factors of metabolic syndrome on blood viscosity and the prognosis of acute ischemic stroke in Indonesia based on the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS). METHODS: This study included 135 patients with acute ischemic stroke. Patients underwent measurements of viscosity and risk factor assessment. Analysis was performed to assess the role of these risk factors for blood viscosity and outcomes of acute ischemic stroke with NIHSS and mRS as indicators. NIHSS was assessed at <3 days after onset and 7 days after onset, while mRS was assessed 1 month post treatment. Bivariate analysis was performed using chi-square test, and variables with p < 0.25 were further analyzed in multivariate analysis using logistic regression. RESULTS: Factors affecting blood viscosity are fibrinogen, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and hematocrit. Factors affecting NIHSS and mRS are fibrinogen and LDL. CONCLUSION: Fibrinogen and LDL affect the viscosity of blood and outcomes in acute ischemic stroke patients, so it is necessary to treat in the primary and secondary prevention of ischemic stroke.","Rasyid A, Harris S, Kurniawan M, Mesiano T, Hidayat R",Ann Neurosci,2019 Jul,Stroke AND Indonesia
30534355,"TOAST Subtypes of Ischemic Stroke and Its Risk Factors: A Hospital-Based Study at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability, with ischemic stroke as the highest prevalent cases in Indonesia. Ischemic stroke can be classified further into five subtypes according to TOAST classification. Numerous studies have revealed that stroke risk factor has variable correlation with different stroke subtype. Currently, there is no data regarding this phenomenon in Indonesia. The aim of study is to identify characteristic of ischemic stroke subtypes and the risk factors in TOAST classification. METHODS: A retrospective, cross-sectional study of patients diagnosed with ischemic stroke at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital from January till December 2016. Demographic data, ischemic stroke subtypes, risk factors, and other relevant data were documented. Bivariate and multivariate analysis was done using SPSS 23. RESULTS: 235 recorded data patients were included. Large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) was the most prevalent stroke subtypes at 59,6%, followed with small vessel disease (SVD) at 26,7%, undetermined etiology at 9,8%, cardioembolism (CE) at 2,1%, and other determined etiology at 0,9%. Hypertension was the most common vascular risk factor. However, it was only significant in SVD (p=0,023) and undetermined etiology subtypes (p<0,001). Significant risk factor in LAA was diabetes (55%; p=0,016) while in CE subtypes was atrial fibrillation (60%;p<0,001). In multivariate analyses, hypertension (OR 3; 95% CI 1,12-8,05) was the only variable that was related to SVD while in CE it was atrial fibrillation (OR 113,5; 95% CI 13,6-946,5). CONCLUSION: LAA was the most common stroke ischemic subtypes. Associated risk factor in LAA was diabetes while in SVD and undetermined etiology subtypes it was hypertension. Atrial fibrillation was associated with cardioembolism.","Harris S, Sungkar S, Rasyid A, Kurniawan M, Mesiano T, Hidayat R",Stroke Res Treat,2018,Stroke AND Indonesia
37685732,Self-Efficacy and Self-Care as Risk Factors for Ischemic Stroke: Development and Validation of a Nomogram.,"BACKGROUND: This study addresses the knowledge gap on how self-efficacy and self-care affect stroke risk as factors and develops a valuable tool for clinicians to assess stroke risk. METHODS: From January 2022 to January 2023, this nested-case control study was conducted. Medical data including gender, age, ethnicity, locality, education, marital status, employment, caregiver, social environment, blood viscosity, Barthel Index, modified Rankin Scale (mRS), stroke risk score, self-care score, and self-efficacy score were collected. Logistic regression was used to predict stroke risk, and a nomogram was developed and validated. RESULTS: 240 patients were included in the analysis. Stroke risk score (OR: 3.513; p = 0.005), self-efficacy score (OR: 0.753; p = 0.048), and self-care score (OR: 0.817; p = 0.018) were predictors of ischemic stroke. Internal validation was carried out, with a C-index of 0.774, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test indicated a good fit (p = 0.92). The calibration plot also shows that this nomogram model has good calibration abilities. The decision curve analysis (DCA) results show a threshold probability range of 10-95%. CONCLUSION: A nomogram has been developed with good validity, calibration, and clinical utility, including self-care and self-efficacy as risk factors for predicting ischemic stroke.","Rasyid A, Pemila U, Aisah S, Harris S, Wiyarta E, Fisher M",J Clin Med,2023 Aug 31,Stroke AND Indonesia
36843040,Impacts of medication non-adherence to major modifiable stroke-related diseases on stroke prevention and mortality: a meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Medication adherence is one of the crucial attempts in primary stroke prevention. The available evidence lacks comprehensive reviews exploring the association of medication adherence with stroke prevention. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of non-adherence to medications used to treat the modifiable risk of diseases on stroke-associated outcomes in primary stroke prevention. METHODS: Study records were searched from PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL. Those studies reported risks relevant to stroke-associated outcomes and medication non-adherence for patients diagnosed with four modifiable stroke-related diseases (atrial fibrillation [AF], hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus) but without stroke history were included for meta-analysis and further subgroup, sensitivity, and publication bias analyses. A random effect model was performed to analyse the pooled risk estimates of relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies (with 2,117,789 participants in total) designed as cohort or case-control studies were included. Those patients presenting with four stroke-related diseases and categorised as medication non-adherent tended to result in stroke and/or associated death (all pooled RR >/= 1 and 95% CI did not include 1). The findings of stratification and sensitivity analysis for each stroke-related disease showed a similar trend. Non-adherent patients with AF were prone to stroke occurrence (RR 1.852; 95% CI 1.583-2.166) but inclined to reduced bleeding (RR 0.894; 95% CI 0.803-0.996). The existence of publication bias warrants further interpretation. CONCLUSIONS: Non-adherence to medications for the four stroke-related diseases contributes to the development of stroke and/or mortality in primary stroke prevention. More efforts are needed to improve patients' medication adherence.","Mafruhah OR, Huang YM, Lin HW",J Neurol,2023 May,Stroke AND Indonesia
32728574,Depression and functional disability in stroke patients.,"Background: Stroke patients often suffer from depression, a mental disorder that worsens their condition and slows down the recovery process. Depression is the leading cause of functional disability due to inability to cope with daily stressors and to function independently in their activities. The purpose of this study is to analyze the relationship between depression and functional disability levels in post-stroke patients. Design and Methods: This is an analytic observational research with a cross-sectional approach. The population in exam consisted of all 4-12 week post-stroke patient in the hospital (about 139 patients). The study focused on 104 respondents, who were selected using simple random sampling techniques. Results: The results show that 62.5% stroke patients suffered mild depressive episodes after the stroke while 58.7% experienced mild disabilities. Analysis results using the Pearson Product Moment Test obtained P=0,000. This shows there is a relationship between the level of depression and the degree of functional disability in post-stroke patients. Conclusions: It can be concluded that there is a significant relationship between the levels of post-stroke depression and the functional disability. Families are expected to provide a safe, supportive, and comfortable environment to lessen the level of depression.","Astuti P, Kusnanto K, Dwi Novitasari F",J Public Health Res,2020 Jul 3,Stroke AND Indonesia
38968643,Stroke in critically ill patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19: Disparities between low-middle and high-income countries.,"PURPOSE: We aimed to compare the incidence of stroke in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) versus high-income countries (HICs) in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and its impact on in-hospital mortality. METHODS: International observational study conducted in 43 countries. Stroke and mortality incidence rates and rate ratios (IRR) were calculated per admitted days using Poisson regression. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) was used to address the HICs vs. LMICs imbalance for confounders. RESULTS: 23,738 patients [20,511(86.4 %) HICs vs. 3,227(13.6 %) LMICs] were included. The incidence stroke/1000 admitted-days was 35.7 (95 %CI = 28.4-44.9) LMICs and 17.6 (95 %CI = 15.8-19.7) HICs; ischemic 9.47 (95 %CI = 6.57-13.7) LMICs, 1.97 (95 %CI = 1.53, 2.55) HICs; hemorrhagic, 7.18 (95 %CI = 4.73-10.9) LMICs, and 2.52 (95 %CI = 2.00-3.16) HICs; unspecified stroke type 11.6 (95 %CI = 7.75-17.3) LMICs, 8.99 (95 %CI = 7.70-10.5) HICs. In regression with IPW, LMICs vs. HICs had IRR = 1.78 (95 %CI = 1.31-2.42, p < 0.001). Patients from LMICs were more likely to die than those from HICs [43.6% vs 29.2 %; Relative Risk (RR) = 2.59 (95 %CI = 2.29-2.93), p < 0.001)]. Patients with stroke were more likely to die than those without stroke [RR = 1.43 (95 %CI = 1.19-1.72), p < 0.001)]. CONCLUSIONS: Stroke incidence was low in HICs and LMICs although the stroke risk was higher in LMICs. Both LMIC status and stroke increased the risk of death. Improving early diagnosis of stroke and redistribution of healthcare resources should be a priority.

35721127,Use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine and Adherence to Medication Therapy Among Stroke Patients: A Meta-analysis and Systematic Review.,"Purpose: To identify the use patterns of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and its impact on medication adherence among patients with stroke. Method: A systematic search through Science Direct, Google Scholar, and PubMed was performed to identify potential studies up to June 2021.The primary outcome was CAM use, and the secondary outcome was medication adherence among patients with stroke. Articles included in the review met the following criteria: 1) patients with stroke >/=18 years old on prescribed medications, and 2) medication adherence reported status. Meta-analyses were conducted to estimate the pooled prevalence of complementary and alternative medicine and adherence in stroke patients using a random-effects model. Results: A total of 1,330 studies were screened, of which 22 were included in the final analysis. The type of studies included were cross-sectional surveys, cohort studies, retrospective studies and prospective survey. The pooled prevalence of CAM usage was at 38% (29-48% CI) and medication non-adherence among stroke patients was at 29% (20-48% CI). The most common reason for inadequate stroke therapy and higher dependence on CAM was the patients' lack of knowledge and the regimen complexity of the medication. Other factors for medication non-adherence were forgetfulness, side effects, cost, and lack of doctor-patient communication. Conclusion: A low prevalence of CAM usage and non-adherence to medications was observed among patients with stroke. Studies investigating the association between CAM usage and medication adherence among patients with stroke are scarce and future researches are needed to explore the influence of CAM use on stroke medication adherence.","Rajahthurai SD, Farrukh MJ, Makmor-Bakry M, Tan HJ, Fatokun O, Mohd Saffian S, Ramatillah DL",Front Pharmacol,2022,Stroke AND Indonesia
34873756,Effects of telehealth interventions on performing activities of daily living and maintaining balance in stroke survivors: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled studies.,"BACKGROUND: Stroke is one of the most common causes of disability worldwide. In recent years, diverse telehealth programmes for stroke survivors have suggested that this mode of rehabilitation could improve stroke survivors' abilities to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) and maintain balance. Although increasingly utilised in clinical and community settings, the effectiveness of telehealth interventions in stroke survivors remains inconclusive. This warrants investigation so that telehealth interventions are evidence-based and are not merely modalities of convenience. AIM: To identify the effects of telehealth interventions on the ability to perform ADLs and maintain balance in stroke survivors. DESIGN: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis were conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed using seven databases for literature dated up to April 25, 2021. The revised Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised trials was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. A meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model to calculate the pooled effects of telehealth interventions. Stata 16.0 was used for the statistical analyses. RESULTS: A total of 14 studies with 1,367 participants were included in the analysis. Overall, telehealth interventions were effective in improving stroke survivors' abilities to carry out their ADLs (standardised mean difference: .45; 95% confidence interval: .12 to .78); however, no significant effects were found on balance. CONCLUSION: Telehealth interventions are beneficial for improving stroke survivors' performance of their ADLs. Future telehealth intervention trials should focus on identifying essential intervention delivery components that facilitate intervention adoption by clinicians and stroke survivors and sustain the positive effects on stroke survivors' performance of their ADLs in different settings. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: It is essential to build flexibility in the telehealth-based intervention delivery protocol to meet individual stroke survivors' needs to motivate and enhance their ADL performance.","Saragih ID, Tarihoran DETAU, Batubara SO, Tzeng HM, Lin CJ",J Clin Nurs,2022 Oct,Stroke AND Indonesia
27746080,Comparison of Characteristics of Stroke-Associated Pneumonia in Stroke Care Units in Indonesia and Japan.,"BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is one of the most common medical complications after stroke. Incidence and risk factor analyses of stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) in stroke care units (SCUs) are limited. SAP incidence comparisons across countries can identify the most effective treatment to reduce this incidence. METHODS: This was a retrospective study including consecutive patients with acute stroke in SCUs in 2 hospitals: 105 patients (mean age 78.2 +/- 5.8) from the National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center (NCVC) in Osaka, Japan (from July to August 2015), and 105 patients (mean age 60 +/- 5.8) from the National Brain Centre (NBC) Hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia (from May to September 2015). We used descriptive statistics and a logistic regression model for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The incidence of SAP in the SCU NBC Hospital was higher than that in the SCU NCVC (22.9% versus 12.4%, P = .0466). In the SCU NBC Hospital, dysphagia (odds ratio [OR] 15.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.77-130.73) and severe neurological deficits on admission (OR 5.31, 95% CI 1.60-17.60) were significantly associated with SAP, whereas in the SCU NCVC, dysphagia (OR 14.42, 95% CI 2.34-88.98) and diabetes mellitus (OR 7.16, 95% CI 1.27-40.18) were the risk factors. When the patients of both hospitals were analyzed together, severe neurological deficits on admission (OR 3.36, 95% CI 1.31-8.64) and dysphagia (OR 12.62, 95% CI 3.75-42.45) were significant determinants for developing SAP. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of SAP was higher in the Indonesian hospital than in the Japanese one. Our findings support other epidemiological data of a high incidence of SAP with severe neurological deficits on admission and dysphagia in an SCU setting.","Sari IM, Soertidewi L, Yokota C, Kikuno M, Koga M, Toyoda K",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,2017 Feb,Stroke AND Indonesia
33708378,"Hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke in patients with coronavirus disease 2019: incidence, risk factors, and pathogenesis - a systematic review and meta-analysis.","Background: In this study, we aimed to determine the global prevalence, chronological order of symptom appearance, and mortality rates with regard to hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to discuss possible pathogeneses of hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke in individuals with the disease. Methods: We searched the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases for relevant articles published up to November 8, 2020. Data regarding study characteristics, hemorrhagic stroke, ischemic stroke, and COVID-19 were retrieved in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the quality of the eligible studies. The pooled prevalence and mortality rate of hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke were calculated. Results: The pooled estimate of prevalence of hemorrhagic stroke was 0.46% (95% CI 0.40%-0.53%; I (2) =89.81%) among 67,155 COVID-19 patients and that of ischemic stroke was 1.11% (95% CI 1.03%-1.22%; I (2) =94.07%) among 58,104 COVID-19 patients. Ischemic stroke was more predominant (incidence: 71.58%) than hemorrhagic stroke (incidence: 28.42%) in COVID-19 patients who experienced a stroke. In COVID-19 patients who experienced a stroke, hospital admission with respiratory symptoms was more commonly reported than that with neurological symptoms (20.83% for hemorrhagic stroke and 5.51% for ischemic stroke versus 6.94% for hemorrhagic stroke and 5.33% for ischemic stroke, respectively). The pooled mortality rate of COVID-19 patients who experienced a hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke was 44.72% (95% CI 36.73%-52.98%) and 36.23% (95% CI 30.63%-42.24%), respectively. Conclusions: Although the occurrence of hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke is low, the mortality rates of both stroke types in patients with COVID-19 are concerning, and therefore, despite several potential pathogeneses that have been proposed, studies aimed at definitively elucidating the mechanisms of hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke in individuals with COVID-19 are warranted.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature in the databases Academic Search Complete, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PubMed, Ovid (and its companion UpToDate), and Web of Science published from January 1, 2002, to May 27, 2021. The methodologic quality of the included studies was evaluated using version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. A meta-analysis using a random-effects model calculated the pooled standardised mean difference (SMD) for using a videoconferencing intervention with stroke survivors and for the ability of survivors to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) and to maintain balance. The Stata software application (version 16.0: StataCorp LP) was used for the statistical analysis. RESULTS: Nine studies with 603 participants were included in the analysis. Videoconferencing interventions were observed to be effective in improving the ability of stroke survivors to carry out their ADLs (SMD: 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.13 to 1.01) and to recover their balance (SMD: 1.96; 95% CI: 1.27 to 2.66). CONCLUSIONS: Stroke survivors were able effectively to improve their ADL and balancing abilities. Further studies could consider the frequency, duration, and standard protocol for videoconferencing interventions. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study could change the approach to patient support in future clinical practice and might constitute an alternative for improving care for stroke survivors in their homes or in long-term care facilities.","Tarihoran DETAU, Daryanti Saragih I, Saragih IS, Tzeng HM",J Clin Nurs,2023 Sep,Stroke AND Indonesia
36018723,Factors Associated With Depression Among Family Caregivers of Patients With Stroke in Indonesia: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"BACKGROUND: Strokes may lead to increased dependency, which may impact the daily lives of patients with stroke and their family caregivers. Caring for a poststroke family member in Indonesia may differ from other countries in terms of extending beyond the provision of hands-on care. Contradictions and gaps in the factors affecting caregiver depression have been highlighted in a review of the relevant literature. Few studies have examined comprehensively the contradictory factors, uncovered factors, and cultural and spiritual values affecting this phenomenon. PURPOSE: This study was designed to identify the factors associated with depression in family caregivers of patients with stroke in Indonesia. We examined the following factors related to caregiver depression: demographic characteristics of the caregiver and care recipient, functional ability of the patient, caregiver self-efficacy, knowledge regarding stroke care, and spiritual values. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 157 primary caregivers completed questionnaires involving depression factors during face-to-face interviews. The data were analyzed using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: The prevalence of depression among the participants was 56.7%. The overall mean ages of the participants and their care recipients were 43.6 and 57.1 years, respectively. In this study, 65.6% of the participants were female, and 70.1% lacked knowledge regarding stroke care. In the early caregiving phase, caregiver depression was more likely to occur in female caregivers with back pain and long care hours. Self-efficacy in achieving respite time was found to be associated with a lower risk of depression. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Caregivers' gender, presence of back pain, sufficient respite time, and time since stroke occurrence should be considered when providing knowledge, skills, and coping strategies to caregivers to help them adapt to their caregiving role, maintain their quality of life, and prevent the onset of depression. Understanding the factors influencing caregiver depression may help nursing professionals identify individuals at a higher risk of depression early on and provide critical follow-up and early access to supportive counseling.","Fauziah W, Kato M, Shogenji M, Tsujiguchi H, Taniguchi Y",J Nurs Res,2022 Oct 1,Stroke AND Indonesia

39778534,Stroke Epidemiology in Asia.,"BACKGROUND: Stroke is a major cause of death and disability globally, with different stroke burdens in different regions. This paper reviews the epidemiology of stroke in Asia. SUMMARY: There is a wide range in age- and sex-standardised stroke incidence, highest in China, lowest in Bhutan. Geographically, incidence is highest in East Asia, lowest in South Asia. Stroke mortality is highest in Papua New Guinea, lowest in Singapore. There are variations in mortality within regions - in East Asia, it is higher in Mongolia and North Korea, lowest in Japan; in South Asia, it is higher in Bangladesh and Pakistan, lowest in Sri Lanka; in Southeast Asia, it is higher in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, lowest in Singapore. Stroke disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost is highest in Papua New Guinea, lowest in Singapore. There is intra-regional variation - in East Asia, it is higher in Mongolia and North Korea, lowest in Japan; in South Asia, higher in Bangladesh and Pakistan, lowest in Sri Lanka; in Southeast Asia, it is highest in Papua New Guinea, lowest in Singapore. Among the stroke subtypes, ischaemic stroke (IS) has the highest incidence, intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is second, subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is third. IS incidence is highest in China, lowest in Bhutan. The burden due to ICH is highest in Mongolia; ICH incidence is lowest in Sri Lanka, mortality and DALYs are lowest in Japan. SAH has a high incidence in Japan, Singapore, Brunei, and Republic of Korea. In hospital-based registries, the frequency of ICH was highest in Myanmar, low in Mongolia. Among IS, based on the Trial of Org 10,172 in Acute Stroke Treatment classification, large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) is more frequent in some countries (e.g., China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Pakistan, and Republic of Korea), but small artery occlusion (SAO) in most others (Bangladesh, Nepal, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam); cardioembolism is third. Of the stroke risk factors, hypertension is the most frequent, diabetes mellitus (DM) is usually second, with varying positions for hyperlipidaemia, smoking, and prior stroke or transient ischaemic attacks, obesity, and insufficient physical activity. KEY MESSAGES: Asia carries a particularly heavy burden of stroke, higher in some countries. IS is the most common subtype. Among IS, the more common mechanisms are LAA and SAO. Hypertension and DM are the more common risk factors. A greater understanding of stroke epidemiology and risk factors will help in healthcare planning for the prevention and management of stroke.",Venketasubramanian N,Cerebrovasc Dis Extra,2025,Stroke AND Indonesia
38585525,Improving caregiver preparedness in the care transition of stroke patients: a scoping review.,"Stroke is a life-threatening condition caused by the rupture of a brain blood vessel, potentially causing brain damage within minutes, severe disability, and even death. After initial hospitalization and rehabilitation, most stroke survivors return home, relying on their family members as caregivers for activities of daily living and treatments. This scoping review aimed to evaluate caregivers' readiness for transitioning stroke patient care to a home environment. We conducted a comprehensive search on Scopus, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases, followed by a secondary search to identify articles based on predefined criteria. A total of 14 articles were synthesized, leading to a series of findings: (1) there is a need to assess and identify caregiver needs, (2) the process needs relevant information, (3) caregivers are involved in the care process until the patients are discharged from the hospital, and (4) there is a need to offer support to caregivers. These results indicate that implementing strategies to enhance caregiver preparedness is crucial for the effective home-based care of stroke survivors.","Damaiyanti M, Amir H, Cahyani DD, Alhidayat NS, Afrianti N, Rahmiati C, Hastuti H, Sari AS, Hidayat R",J Med Life,2023 Dec,Stroke AND Indonesia
36999894,Robotic arm use for upper limb rehabilitation after stroke: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Several studies have reported the effects of robotic arms on improving upper limb function in patients with stroke. However, previous studies have reported inconsistent findings that may lead to incorrect applications of robotic arm use. Six databases were searched for relevant randomized controlled trials. Meta-analyses were performed for upper limb performance measures, including subgroup analysis of pooled upper limb rehabilitation data such as stroke stage and intervention delivery dose. Furthermore, the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials version 2 (RoB 2) and sensitivity analysis were used to assess methodology and determine publication bias. The final analysis included 18 studies. Robotic arms improved upper limb and hand function in patients with stroke. Subgroup analysis revealed that robotic arm interventions lasting 30-60 min per session significantly improved upper limb function. However, no significant improvement was observed in shoulder and elbow or wrist and hand movements. This review may help develop applicable rehabilitation robots and collaboration between clinicians.","Lee BO, Saragih ID, Batubara SO",Kaohsiung J Med Sci,2023 May,Stroke AND Indonesia
38450343,Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 in Indonesia: Assessment of the role of sex and age.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), can manifest in multiple organs. While the primary manifestations of COVID-19 occur in the respiratory system, other organ systems are also involved, including nervous systems that cause neurological symptoms. The aim of this study was to determine the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 patients and to assess the role of age and sex on neurological manifestation incidence. A cross-sectional study was conducted at Pelamonia Hospital, Makassar, Indonesia, among inpatient COVID-19 cases, using a total sampling method. Demographic data and neurological manifestations of the COVID-19 patients were collected. The associations between age and sex with the incidence of neurological symptoms were analyzed using the Chi-squared test. Out of 424 inpatients with COVID-19 cases, 62.3% were females, with the highest age group was 20-40 years (42.7%). The neurological symptoms were reported in 232 patients, accounting for approximately 54.7%. The most frequently reported neurological symptom was headache (n=104, 44.8%), followed by anosmia (n=44, 18.9%), ageusia (n=48, 20.6%), myopathy (n=14, 6%), stroke (n=10, 4.3%), seizure (n=5, 2.1%), and altered consciousness (n=7, 3%). An association was found between sex and the incidence of headache, myopathy, stroke, and altered consciousness. There was also an association between age and the incidence of headache and stroke. The study highlights that COVID-19 patients commonly exhibit neurological implications affecting the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. Therefore, it is crucial for the early detection of neurological symptoms in COVID-19 cases to have better management.","Sompa AW, Harun H, Mimika RA, Riksanto R",Narra J,2023 Dec,Stroke AND Indonesia
35673677,Clinical outcome and safety of stem cell therapy for ischemic stroke: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Several reports on stem cell administration have emerged proving it to be an ideal therapeutic approach for improving neurological functions in ischemic stroke patients. However, some studies also show disappointing results, with some reporting no statistically significant improvements among several different parameters. Several challenges also arise relating to safety and nonscientific aspects, such as ethics. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of stem cell therapy on the clinical outcomes of ischemic stroke patients. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. A thorough literature search was conducted on PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases. Articles were selected systematically based on the PRISMA protocol and reviewed completely. A total of 19 publications pertaining to stem cell therapy on the ischemic route were included and reviewed. Efficacy outcomes were measured with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, modified Rankin Scale, or Barthel Index. RESULTS: The results of the meta-analysis indicate that the efficacy outcomes suggest favorable results after stem cell therapy, although not all study results are statistically significant. Stem cell therapy in stroke cases showed a better outcome than standard conservative therapy alone, although our analysis shows that many factors can influence this outcome, and significant effects can only be seen after several months. CONCLUSION: The results of this study show promising and satisfying efficacy and a relatively low rate of serious adverse events.","Permana AT, Bajamal AH, Parenrengi MA, Suroto NS, Lestari P, Fauzi AA",Surg Neurol Int,2022,Stroke AND Indonesia
37456638,"Trends in deaths and disability-adjusted life-years of stroke attributable to high body-mass index worldwide, 1990-2019.","BACKGROUND: High body mass index (HBMI) is an independent risk factor for stroke. Previous studies on the incremental burden of the rapid growth of stroke attributable to HBMI are incomplete and lag behind. We aim to assess the global burden of stroke attributable to HBMI based on a public database online. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study data were taken from the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study; deaths, the Disability-Adjusted Life-Years (DALYs), and their age-standardized rates were screened. The join point regression was used, wherein age-standardized rates were referred to as temporal trends in disease burden. RESULTS: Deaths from stroke attributable to HBMI worldwide were on the rise during 1990-2019, with an increase of 88.75%. Age-standardized DALYs were on the rise during 1990-2003 but declined during 2003-2013, with a turning point in 2013 and an increasing trend since then [the Annual Percentage Change (APC) = 0.30%, p < 0.05]. China, India, Indonesia, the Russian Federation, and the United States of America shared in sequence the rate of leading deaths and DALYs in 2019. The Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) was associated with an increasing trend in age-standardized deaths (R = -0.24, p < 0.001) and age-standardized DALYs (R = -0.22, p = 0.0018). CONCLUSION: A range of indicators for the global burden of stroke attributable to HBMI have been on the rise for the past three decades. Tremendous efforts worldwide should be in place to control and treat stroke attributable to HBMI, especially in regions with high-middle and middle SDIs and among middle-aged and aged populations.","Guo X, Li J, Yin X, Zhang Z, Zhong Q, Zhu F",Front Neurol,2023,Stroke AND Indonesia
37849564,Correlation Between Hypercoagulable State and Severity Level of Ischemic Stroke With Covid-19 Infection.,"BACKGROUND: Hypercoagulable state in acute ischemic stroke patients with COVID-19, was found to occur in most cases, may affect the severity and clinical outcome of acute ischemic stroke with COVID-19. Ischemic stroke patients with COVID-19 infection have worsen prognosis in mortality regarding hypercoagulable state condition. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to determine the relationship between the hypercoagulable state and the severity of acute ischemic stroke patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This study is a retrospective analytic study using a cross-sectional method in acute ischemic stroke who meet the criteria must have focal clinical symptoms or global dysfunction lasting more than 24 hours, be caused by vascular factors, be confirmed positive for COVID-19, NIHSS (admission and discharge), and have an examination of D-dimer and/or fibrinogen. Chi-Square is used for data processing relationship analysis. RESULTS: A total of 32 patients met the inclusion and exclusion criteria of this study. Elevated D-dimer and/or fibrinogen were found in 28 patients (87.5%), confirming a hypercoagulable state. In this study, the average value of D-dimer was 5.3 mg/mL, and fibrinogen was 479 mg/dL. Based on the admission NIHSS score, it was found that most of the patients had moderate strokes with an average NIHSS score of 12. The chi-square test results showed no relationship between the hypercoagulable state and the severity of acute ischemic stroke as measured by NIHSS admission (p=0.333), but it was closely related to NIHSS exit (p=0.02). The finding supports that 40.62% of acute ischemic stroke patients with COVID-19 confirmed to have a hypercoagulable state had a death discharge status. CONCLUSION: There is no significant relationship between hypercoagulable state and stroke severity on admission, but it closely related to NIHSS on discharge and high mortality in acute ischemic stroke patients with COVID-19.",Amalia L,J Blood Med,2023,Stroke AND Indonesia
37251214,Exploring the self-efficacy and self-care-based stroke care model for risk factor modification in mild-to-moderate stroke patients.,"CONTEXT: The worldwide burden of stroke is projected to grow unless proper stroke education is implemented. Information alone cannot promote patient self-efficacy and self-care and reduce risk factors. AIM: This trial aimed to test self-efficacy and self-care-based stroke education (SSE) on changes in self-efficacy, self-care, and risk factor modification. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This study is a single-center, double-blinded, interventional, two-arm randomized controlled trial with a 1- and 3-month follow-up in Indonesia. Between January 2022 and October 2022, 120 patients were prospectively enrolled from Cipto Mangunkusumo National Hospital, Indonesia. Participants were assigned using a computer-generated random number list. INTERVENTION: SSE was given before discharge from the hospital. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Self-care, self-efficacy, and stroke risk score was measured 1 month and 3 months after discharge. SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Modified Rankin Scale, Barthel Index, and blood viscosity was measured at 1 month and 3 months after discharge. RESULTS: A total of 120 patients (intervention n = 60; standard care n = 60) were randomized. In the 1st month, the intervention group showed a more significant change in self-care (4.56 [95% CI: 0.57, 8.56]), self-efficacy (4.95 [95% CI: 0.84, 9.06]), and stroke risk (-2.33 [95% CI:-3.19, -1.47]) compared to the controlled group. In the 3rd month, the intervention group also showed a more significant change in self-care (19.28 [95% CI: 16.01, 22.56]), self-efficacy (19.95 [95% CI: 16.61, 23.28]), and stroke risk (-3.83 [95% CI: -4.65, -3.01]) compared to the controlled group. CONCLUSION: SSE may boost self-care and self-efficacy, adjust risk factors, enhance functional outcomes, and decrease blood viscosity.

37666385,Genetic Polymorphisms of Ischemic Stroke in Asians.,"The increasing incidence of ischemic stroke emphasizes the necessity for early detection and preventive strategies. Diagnostic biomarkers currently available for ischemic stroke only become detectable shortly before the manifestation of stroke symptoms. Genetic variants associated with ischemic stroke offer a potential solution to address this diagnostic limitation. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that genetic variants cannot be modified in the same way as epigenetic changes. Nevertheless, individuals carrying risk or protective variants can modify their lifestyle to potentially influence the associated epigenetic factors. This study aims to summarize specific variants relevant to Asian populations that may aid in the early detection of ischemic stroke and explore their impact on the disease's pathophysiology. These variants give us important information about the genes that play a role in ischemic stroke by affecting things like atherosclerosis pathway, blood coagulation pathway, homocysteine metabolism, transporter function, transcription, and the activity of neurons regulation. It is important to recognize the variations in genetic variants among different ethnicities and avoid generalizing the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke.","Besin V, Yulianti T, Notopuro PB, Humardani FM",Clin Chim Acta,2023 Sep 1,Stroke AND Indonesia
37752663,Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in central post-stroke pain: current status and future perspective.,"Central post-stroke pain (CPSP) is an incapacitating disorder that impacts a substantial proportion of stroke survivors and can diminish their quality of life. Conventional therapies for CPSP, including tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and opioids, are frequently ineffective, necessitating the investigation of alternative therapeutic strategies. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is now recognized as a promising noninvasive pain management method for CPSP. rTMS modulates neural activity through the administration of magnetic pulses to specific cortical regions. Trials analyzing the effects of rTMS on CPSP have generated various outcomes, but the evidence suggests possible analgesic benefits. In CPSP and other neuropathic pain conditions, high-frequency rTMS targeting the primary motor cortex (M1) with figure-eight coils has demonstrated significant pain alleviation. Due to its associaton with analgesic benefits, M1 is the most frequently targeted area. The duration and frequency of rTMS sessions, as well as the stimulation intensity, have been studied in an effort to optimize treatment outcomes. The short-term pain relief effects of rTMS have been observed, but the long-term effects (> 3 months) require further investigation. Aspects such as stimulation frequency, location, and treatment period can influence the efficacy of rTMS and ought to be considered while planning the procedure. Standardized guidelines for using rTMS in CPSP would optimize therapy protocols and improve patient outcomes. This review article provides an up-to-date overview of the incidence, clinical characteristics, outcome of rTMS in CPSP patients, and future perspective in the field.","Radiansyah RS, Hadi DW",Korean J Pain,2023 Oct 1,Stroke AND Indonesia
39200922,Global Insights on Prehospital Stroke Care: A Comprehensive Review of Challenges and Solutions in Low- and Middle-Income Countries.,"Stroke is a leading cause of disability and mortality worldwide, and it disproportionately affects low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which account for 88% of stroke fatalities. Prehospital stroke care delays are a crucial obstacle to successful treatment in these settings, especially given the limited therapeutic window for thrombolytic treatments, which may greatly improve recovery chances when initiated early after stroke onset. These delays are caused by a lack of public understanding of stroke symptoms, sociodemographic and cultural variables, and insufficient healthcare infrastructure. This review discusses these issues in detail, emphasizing the disparities in stroke awareness and reaction times between locations and socioeconomic classes. Innovative options for reducing these delays include the deployment of mobile stroke units and community-based educational campaigns. This review also discusses how technology improvements and personalized educational initiatives might improve stroke awareness and response in LMICs. The primary goal is to give a thorough assessment of the challenges and potential remedies that might serve as the foundation for policy reforms and healthcare improvements in LMICs, eventually improving stroke care and lowering disease-related mortality and disability.","Wiyarta E, Fisher M, Kurniawan M, Hidayat R, Geraldi IP, Khan QA, Widyadharma IPE, Badshah A, Pandian JD",J Clin Med,2024 Aug 14,Stroke AND Indonesia
33259522,Tobacco smoking and risk of all-cause mortality in Indonesia.,"Tobacco is well known as a risk factor for early morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, the relative risk of mortality and the effects of smoking vary among the countries. Indonesia, as one of the world's largest market for smoking tobacco, is significantly affected by tobacco-related illness. Previous research has shown that smoking causes several diseases, including stroke, neoplasm and coronary heart disease. There has to date been no research on the hazard risk of smoking for all-cause mortality in Indonesia. This study aimed to identify the association between smoking and all-cause mortality rates in Indonesia. Information from a total of 3,353 respondents aged 40 years and older was collected in this study. The data were taken from the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) Wave 4 (2007) to collect personal information and determine smoking status and from Wave 5 (2015) to collect information about deaths. Current smokers make up 40.3% of Indonesia's population. Current smokers were more likely to have a higher risk of all-cause death (hazard ratio = 1.48, 95% confidence interval = 1.11 to 1.98) than non-current smokers. The number of smokers in Indonesia remains high and is expected to increase gradually every year. A firm government policy is needed to reduce the number of smokers in Indonesia which would automatically reduce the health problem of smoking-related illness in the future.","Holipah H, Sulistomo HW, Maharani A",PLoS One,2020,Stroke AND Indonesia

We aimed to determine the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing, insomnia, periodic leg movement during sleep, and restless leg syndrome following stroke or TIA in acute, subacute, and chronic phases and examine the moderating effects of patient characteristics (eg, age) and methodological features (eg, study quality) on the prevalence. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. Embase and PubMed were searched from inception to December 18, 2019. We included 64 047 adults in 169 studies (prospective, retrospective, case-control, and cross-sectional study designs) reporting the prevalence of sleep disorders following stroke or TIA. RESULTS: In the acute phase, the overall prevalence of mild, moderate, and severe sleep-disordered breathing was 66.8%, 50.3%, and 31.6% (95% CIs, 63.8-69.7, 41.9-58.7, and 24.9-39.1). In the subacute phase, the prevalence of mild, moderate, and severe sleep-disordered breathing was 65.5%, 44.3%, and 36.1% (95% CIs, 58.9-71.5, 36.1-52.8, and 22.2-52.8). In the chronic phase, the summary prevalence of mild, moderate, and severe sleep-disordered breathing was 66.2%, 33.1%, and 25.1% (95% CIs, 58.6-73.1, 24.8-42.6, and 10.9-47.6). The prevalence rates of insomnia in the acute, subacute, and chronic phases were 40.7%, 42.6%, and 35.9% (95% CIs, 31.8-50.3, 31.7-54.1, and 28.6-44.0). The pooled prevalence of periodic leg movement during sleep in the acute, subacute, and chronic phases was 32.0%, 27.3%, and 48.2% (95% CIs, 7.4-73.5, 11.6-51.7, and 33.1-63.5). The summary prevalence of restless leg syndrome in the acute and chronic phases was 10.4% and 13.7% (95 CIs, 6.4-16.4 and 2.3-51.8). Age, sex, comorbidities, smoking history, and study region had significant moderating effects on the prevalence of sleep disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disorders following stroke or TIA are highly prevalent over time. Our findings indicate the importance of early screening and treating sleep disorders following stroke or TIA.","Hasan F, Gordon C, Wu D, Huang HC, Yuliana LT, Susatia B, Marta OFD, Chiu HY",Stroke,2021 Jan,Stroke AND Indonesia

40157215,Post-stroke cognitive impairment and dementia research in Southeast Asia: A scoping review.,"INTRODUCTION: The incidence of stroke remains high in Southeast Asia (SEA), according to the 2021 Global Burden of Disease study. Stroke can lead to cognitive impairments and dementia, highlighting the need for evidence-based management. AIM: To chart the research on post-stroke cognitive impairment and dementia (PSCID) in SEA. METHODS: The review was conducted and reported using the PRISMA-ScR. A comprehensive search was performed across six databases: CINAHL, Scopus, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, and APA PsycINFO. The last search date was September 15, 2024. RESULTS: 9118 references were identified, and 103 articles (from 78 studies) published between 1992 and 2024 were included. Singapore contributed 42 articles, followed by Indonesia with 28, Malaysia with 17 and Thailand with 15. 35 articles each were from cohort and cross-sectional studies, and 13 were case-control design articles. In Indonesia, the prevalence of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) ranged from 27.6 % to 81.2 %. In Malaysia, it was between 21.6 % and 76 %; in Singapore, it varied from 12 % to 57.2 %; and in Thailand, between 50.3 % and 55 %. The prevalence of post-troke dementia varied between 2.8 % and 48.4 % in the sources. The most risk factors associated with PSCID included increasing age and low levels of education. Mixed findings on the effectiveness of the limited management strategies for PSCI were reported. The region lacks research from low- and lower-middle-income countries (LLMICs). Moreover, thorough research on how PSCID affects survivors' quality of life (QoL) is deficient. CONCLUSION: PSCID is common in SEA, requiring urgent interventions for improved QoL for survivors. More research focusing on low- and middle-income countries is needed.","Mtambo ML, Ragunathan T, Mohan D, Warren N, Su TT, Quek KF",Asian J Psychiatr,2025 May,Stroke AND Indonesia
36950179,"High socioeconomic status is associated with stroke severity among stroke patients in the National Brain Centre Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia.","Rapid economic growth has widened the gap between the rich and the poor, contributing to inequalities in socioeconomic status (SES) in Indonesia and possibly inequalities in health care. Here, we aimed to assess the potential association between SES and stroke severity in Indonesia, one of the largest low- and middle-income countries. Patients diagnosed with stroke at National Brain Centre (NBC) Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia, in 2020 were included in the study. SES was measured based on marital status, occupation, education level, source of payment, and hospitalized class with smoking status and sex as confounder. Stroke severity was classified based on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score into minor stroke (Adams et al., 1993, Amarenco et al., 2014, Andersen and Olsen, 2018, Austin and Steyerberg, 2017) and moderate to severe stroke (>4). A total of 2,443 patients with moderate to severe stroke (58%) were analyzed. Currently employed patients had a lower adjusted OR (aOR) of 0.65 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-0.83) than unemployed patients. Patients with the highest education level, at least a diploma degree, had a lower aOR of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.49-0.92) than those with an elementary or no education. Our findings showed that patients with a higher SES had a lower risk of more severe stroke than those with a lower SES. Hence, we must focus on improving SES as part of stroke management.","Yamanie N, Chalik Sjaaf A, Felistia Y, Harry Susanto N, Diana A, Lamuri A, Miftahussurur M",Prev Med Rep,2023 Apr,Stroke AND Indonesia
38021057,Increasing of Cortisol Level and Neutrophil-Lymphocyte-Ratio are Associated with Severity Level and Sleep Disturbances in Acute Ischemic Stroke.,"BACKGROUND: Acute ischemic stroke can cause sleep disturbances. These complaints involve various factors, such as disturbances of the hormone cortisol and Neutrophil-Lymphocyte-Ratio (NLR) that can cause increasing severity levels in acute ischemic stroke patients. This study aimed to determine the relationship between cortisol levels and NLR with severity levels and sleep disturbances in acute ischemic stroke patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional analytic observational study was conducted on acute ischemic stroke patients during Agustus - December 2022. Examine cortisol levels using the ELISA method, NLR from blood test, asses severity levels using the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and The Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire Index (PSQI) is used as a measure for the initial screening of sleep disturbances-statistical analysis using Spearman correlation. RESULTS: Total study subjects were 48 patients, with the majority 62.5% women; the mean age of study subjects was above 60 years (56.3%), and the most common type of stroke was large artery atherosclerotic stroke (77.1%), the highest NIHSS score was in the moderate category (85.4%), the most common risk factor is hypertension (64.4%), and basal ganglia area is the most common ischemic stroke location (52.1%). There was a positive correlation between cortisol levels with NIHSS (r=0.874; p-value <0.001), NLR with sleep disturbances (r=0.829; p-value<0.001), NLR with NIHSS (r=0.893; p-value<0.001), and NIHSS with PSQI (r=0.836; p-value<0.001). CONCLUSION: There were a positive correlation between cortisol level, NLR level, and NIHSS score with sleep quality disturbances based on PSQI in acute ischemic stroke patients.","Amalia L, Garyani MD, Lailiyya N",Int J Gen Med,2023,Stroke AND Indonesia
33835735,"Pathomechanism and Management of Stroke in COVID-19: Review of Immunopathogenesis, Coagulopathy, Endothelial Dysfunction, and Downregulation of ACE2.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can reportedly manifest as an acute stroke, with most cases presenting as large vessel ischemic stroke in patients with or without comorbidities. The exact pathomechanism of stroke in COVID-19 remains ambiguous. The findings of previous studies indicate that the most likely underlying mechanisms are cerebrovascular pathological conditions following viral infection, inflammation-induced endothelial dysfunction, and hypercoagulability. Acute endothelial damage due to inflammation triggers a coagulation cascade, thrombosis propagation, and destabilization of atherosclerosis plaques, leading to large-vessel occlusion and plaque ulceration with concomitant thromboemboli, and manifests as ischemic stroke. Another possible mechanism is the downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as the target action of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Acute stroke management protocols need to be modified during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to adequately manage stroke patients with COVID-19.","Rahmawati PL, Tini K, Susilawathi NM, Wijayanti IAS, Samatra DP",J Clin Neurol,2021 Apr,Stroke AND Indonesia
39984906,Association between hydrocarbon exposure and risk of stroke: a systematic literature review.,"BACKGROUND: Hydrocarbon exposure, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), is increasingly linked to vascular dysfunction and stroke, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Common in occupational and environmental contexts, hydrocarbons induce oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction, disrupting vascular health. This systematic review examines the association between hydrocarbon exposure and stroke, emphasizing specific metabolites and their cerebrovascular effects. METHODS: A comprehensive search across PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science was conducted through December 10 2024, identifying observational studies exploring hydrocarbon exposure and stroke risk. Studies meeting predefined inclusion criteria, excluding those with major methodological flaws, were synthesized narratively. Variations in hydrocarbon types, population demographics, and stroke outcomes were considered. RESULTS: Six studies, including five cross-sectional and one retrospective cohort, with sample sizes ranging from 5,537 to 283,666 participants, demonstrated significant associations between hydrocarbon exposure and stroke risk. Key findings revealed strong associations for metabolites like 1-hydroxynaphthalene (OR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.62-2.20) and 2-hydroxyfluorene (OR: 1.94; 95% CI: 1.66-2.26). However, variability in findings was noted, attributed to differences in study design, exposure levels, and populations studied. CONCLUSION: This review highlights a complex relationship between hydrocarbon exposure and stroke risk, with some studies indicating significant associations and others reporting inconsistencies. Standardized, large-scale research is essential to clarify this relationship, identify high-risk populations, and guide public health strategies to mitigate exposure and prevent stroke.

38810878,High C-Reactive Protein/ Albumin Ratio Predicts Mortality and Hemorrhage in Stroke Patients Undergoing Mechanical Thrombectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Stroke outcomes are multifactorial, and the C-Reactive Protein to Albumin Ratio (CAR) has emerged as a potential prognostic marker. This study aims to evaluate CAR prognostic significance in stroke. METHODS: Systematic searches across ScienceDirect, Medline, and Cochrane databases identified longitudinal studies. Unfavorable outcomes, including poor prognosis (modified rankin scale> 2), mortality, and severe complications like hemorrhage or restenosis, were considered. Analyses for unfavorable outcomes were conducted based on prior intervention, stroke type, and outcome type. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 12 cohort studies comprising 5042 participants. Elevated CAR (OR: 1.72; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17-2.52; P = 0.01) and CRP (OR: 1.91; 95% CI: 1.31-2.77; P < 0.001) levels on admission were associated with unfavorable outcomes; no such association was observed for albumin (OR: 0.66; 95%CI: 0.24-1.80; P = 0.42). Elevated CAR levels were associated with unfavorable outcomes in patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy (odds ratio [OR]: 2.70; 95% CI: 1.14-6.38; P < 0.02) and those with ischemic stroke (OR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.24-3.18; P < 0.001), but no significant association was found in patients with hemorrhagic stroke. Furthermore, concerning specific outcomes, high CAR levels were associated with mortality (OR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.00-2.95; P = 0.05) and hemorrhage (OR: 6.02; 95% CI: 1.61-23.87; P = 0.05). The area under the curve for CAR was 0.72 (0.68-0.76), with a sensitivity of 0.61 (0.49-0.71) and specificity of 0.73 (0.64-0.81). CONCLUSIONS: Elevated CAR emerges as an effective marker in assessing unfavorable outcomes in stroke patients with moderately high sensitivity and specificity. High CAR levels exhibited statistically significant mortality and hemorrhage in stroke patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy.","de Liyis BG, Ardhaputra GYB, Liyis S, Wihandani DM, Siahaan YMT, Pinatih KJP",World Neurosurg,2024 Aug,Stroke AND Indonesia
38216918,Degree of COVID-19 severity and mortality in stroke: correlation of clinical and laboratory parameters.,"BACKGROUND: Stroke is one of the neurological manifestations of COVID-19, leading to a significant risk of morbidity and mortality. Clinical manifestations and laboratory parameters were investigated to determine mortality predictors in this case. METHOD: The case control study was conducted at Dr. Sardjito General Hospital,Yogyakarta, Indonesia, with data collected between July 2020 and August 2021. All recorded clinical and laboratory data from acute stroke patients with confirmed COVID-19 were collected. Baseline characteristics, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were assessed to determine significant predictors for mortality. RESULT: This study involved 72 subjects with COVID-19 and stroke. The majority experienced ischemic stroke, with hypertension as the most prevalent comorbidity. Notably, 45.8% of subjects (p < 0.05) loss of consciousness and 72.2% of exhibited motor deficits (p < 0.05). Severe degree of COVID-19 was observed in 52.8% of patients, with respiratory distress and death rates of 56.9% and 58.3%. Comparison of surviving and deceased groups highlighted significant differences in various clinical and laboratory characteristics differences. Hazard ratio (HR) analysis identified loss of consciousness (HR = 2.68; p = 0.01), motor deficit (HR = 2.34; p = 0.03), respiratory distress (HR = 81.51; p < 0.001), and monocyte count (HR:1.002; p = 0.04) as significant predictors of mortality. CONCLUSION: Mortality in COVID-19 patients with stroke was significantly associated with loss of consciousness, motor deficit, respiratory distress, and raised monocyte count. The risk of mortality is heightened when multiple factors coexist.","Gofir A, Satriotomo I, Syamsah YCBN, Rochmah MA, Setyawan TR, Mianoki A, Silalahi RANA, Nugroho DB",BMC Neurosci,2024 Jan 13,Stroke AND Indonesia
37048818,Comparison of the Administration Route of Stem Cell Therapy for Ischemic Stroke: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Clinical Outcomes and Safety.,"Stem cell treatment is emerging as an appealing alternative for stroke patients, but there still needs to be an agreement on the protocols in place, including the route of administration. This systematic review aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of the administration routes of stem cell treatment for ischemic stroke. A systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive literature search was undertaken using the PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases. A total of 21 publications on stem cell therapy for ischemic stroke were included. Efficacy outcomes were measured using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and the Barthel index (BI). Intracerebral administration showed a better outcome than other routes, but a greater number of adverse events followed due to its invasiveness. Adverse events were shown to be related to the natural history of stroke not to the treatment. However, further investigation is required, since studies have yet to compare the different administration methods directly.","Fauzi AA, Thamrin AMH, Permana AT, Ranuh IGMAR, Hidayati HB, Hamdan M, Wahyuhadi J, Suroto NS, Lestari P, Chandra PS",J Clin Med,2023 Apr 6,Stroke AND Indonesia
30803198,Prevalence and Predictors of Current and Former Tobacco Use among Older Adults in Indonesia.,"Purpose: The study aims to describe sociodemographic and health variable indices related to current and former tobacco use among older adults who participated in the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS-5) in 2014-15. Materials and Methods: A national population-based cross-sectional study was conducted with a probability sample of 8,001 aged 50 years or older Indonesians. Results: The overall prevalence of current tobacco use was 33.3% (62.2% in men and 6.5% in women) and former tobacco use was 9.8% (17.4% among men and 2.8% in women), of which 64.4% quit tobacco use when 50 years and older. In multinomial regression analysis, sociodemographic factors (being male, lower education, lower economic status, living in Java and rural residence) and health variables (cancer or malignant tumour, depression symptoms, functional disability and inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption) were associated with current tobacco use. In addition, being overweight or obese, having had a stroke, and other lung conditions were inversely associated with current tobacco use. Further, in adjusted analysis, sociodemographic factors (being 70 years and older, being male, living in Sumatra) and having chronic conditions (dyslipidemia, heart problems, asthma, stomach or digestive diseases and functional disability) were associated with former tobacco use. Conclusions: A high rate of current tobacco use and low rate of former tobacco use was found, particularly among men. The identified risk factors may help to better target this vulnerable population with tobacco cessation programmes.","Pengpid S, Peltzer K",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2019 Feb 26,Stroke AND Indonesia

38187147,Analysis of ischemic stroke burden in Asia from 1990 to 2019: based on the global burden of disease 2019 data.,"BACKGROUND: Ischemic stroke has the characteristics of high morbidity, mortality, and recurrence rate. This study aimed to describe and assess the burden of ischemic stroke in Asia based on the global burden of disease (GBD) 2019 data and provide a crucial scientific foundation for the prevention and control of this life-threatening disease. METHOD: This study used the GBD 2019 data to assess the burden of ischemic stroke. The indicators used in this study were derived from the following methods: (i) the incidence of ischemic stroke was estimated using the disability model for the global burden of disease study-mixed effects regression (DisMod-MR), a Bayesian meta-regression disease modeling tool; (ii) the non-specific codes of all available data on mortality were corrected and used to estimate mortality rates for ischemic stroke and the cause of death ensemble model was used to estimate mortality rates; and (iii) the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) is the sum of years lived with disability (YLD) and the years of life lost (YLL), which quantifies the health loss due to specific diseases and injuries. In addition, the joinpoint regression model was adopted to analyze the temporal trend of ischemic stroke from 1990 to 2019 in Asia. RESULT: This study found an increase in the burden of ischemic stroke in 2019 compared to 1990. Moreover, the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of ischemic stroke showed a gradual upward trend over the specific period. The age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) showed a downward trend in Asia from 1990 to 2019. The burden of ischemic stroke was more concentrated on older age groups, particularly those older than 65 years. East Asia had the highest burden of ischemic stroke compared to other regions in Asia. Particularly, China, India, Indonesia, and Japan had the highest burdens of ischemic stroke among the Asian countries and regions. However, the population with the highest burden of ischemic stroke was still the elderly group. CONCLUSION: Based on our study, it is evident that the burden of ischemic stroke exists substantially and exhibits variations in the aspects of age, gender, and geographical region in Asia. Without targeted implementation of population-wide primary strategies for prevention and control, the burden of ischemic stroke is likely to worsen significantly in the future.","Zhang X, Lv H, Chen X, Li M, Zhou X, Jia X",Front Neurol,2023,Stroke AND Indonesia

38342071,Mesenchymal stem cells and their extracellular vesicles as emerging therapeutic tools in the treatment of ischemic stroke.,"Ischemic stroke (IS) is a neurological condition characterized by severe long-term consequences and an unfavorable prognosis for numerous patients. Despite advancements in stroke treatment, existing therapeutic approaches possess certain limitations. However, accumulating evidence suggests that mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) hold promise as a potential therapy for various neurological disorders, including IS, owing to their advantageous properties, such as immunomodulation and tissue regeneration. Additionally, MSCs primarily exert their therapeutic effects through the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), highlighting the significance of their paracrine activities. These EVs are small double-layered phospholipid membrane vesicles, carrying a diverse cargo of proteins, lipids, and miRNAs that enable effective cell-to-cell communication. Notably, EVs have emerged as attractive substitutes for stem cell therapy due to their reduced immunogenicity, lower tumorigenic potential, and ease of administration and handling. Hence, this review summarizes the current preclinical and clinical studies performed to investigate the safety and therapeutic potential of MSCs and their EVs derived from different sources, including bone marrow, adipose tissue, umbilical cord blood, and Wharton's jelly in IS.","Pratiwi DIN, Alhajlah S, Alawadi A, Hjazi A, Alawsi T, Almalki SG, Alsalamy A, Kumar A",Tissue Cell,2024 Apr,Stroke AND Indonesia

This study aims to investigate the implementation of telestroke on acute stroke care in rural areas. METHODS: Eligible studies published up to November 2019 were included in this study. Randomized trials were further evaluated for risk of bias with Cochrane RoB 2, while nonrandomized studies with ROBINS-I tool. Random effects model was utilized to estimate effect sizes, and the certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) tool. RESULTS: The search yielded 19 studies involving a total of 28,496 subjects, comprising of prehospital and in-hospital telestroke interventions in the form of mobile stroke units and hub-and-spoke hospitals network, respectively. Telestroke successfully increased the proportion of patients treated </=3 hr (OR 2.15; 95% CI 1.37-3.40; I(2)  = 0%) and better three-month functional outcome (OR 1.29; 95% CI 1.01-1.63; I(2)  = 44%) without increasing symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rate (OR 1.27; 0.65-2.49; I(2)  = 0%). Furthermore, telestroke was also associated with shorter onset-to-treatment time (mean difference -27.97 min; 95% CI -35.51, -20.42; I(2)  = 63%) and lower in-hospital mortality rate (OR 0.67; 95% CI 0.52-0.87; I(2)  = 0%). GRADE assessments yielded low-to-moderate certainty of body evidences. CONCLUSION: Telestroke implementation in rural areas was associated with better clinical outcomes as compared to usual care. Its integration in both prehospital and in-hospital settings could help optimize emergency stroke approach. Further studies with higher-level evidence are needed to confirm these findings.","Lazarus G, Permana AP, Nugroho SW, Audrey J, Wijaya DN, Widyahening IS",Brain Behav,2020 Oct,Stroke AND Indonesia

RESULTS: Adults with stroke who met the WHO recommendation of physical activity were independently and significantly associated with lower odds of depression after adjustment for confounders (adjusted OR = 0.757, p = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Performing physical activity according to the WHO recommendation is associated with a lower likelihood of depression among Indonesian adults with stroke. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Clinicians should be informed by the findings of this study and prescribe exercise interventions or plan physical activities to optimize recovery and prevent poststroke depression.","Apriliyasari RW, Budi IS, Tan MP, Tsai PS",J Nurs Scholarsh,2023 Jan,Stroke AND Indonesia
25440332,A prototype worldwide survey of diagnostic and treatment modalities for stroke.,"Stroke is a global health problem. However, very little is known about stroke care in low- to middle-income countries. Obtaining country-specific information could enable us to develop targeted programs to improve stroke care. We surveyed neurologists from 12 countries (Chile, Georgia, Nigeria, Qatar, India, Lithuania, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Denmark, Brazil, Belgium, and Bangladesh) using a web-based survey tool. Data were analyzed both for individual countries and by income classification (low income, lower middle income, upper middle income, and high income). Six percent (n = 200) of 3123 targeted physicians completed the survey. There was a significant correlation between income classification and access and affordability of head computed tomography scan (rho = .215, P = .002), transthoracic echocardiogram (rho = .181, P = .012), extracranial carotid Doppler ultrasound (rho = .312, P </= .000), cardiac telemetry (rho = .353, P </= .000), and stroke treatments such as intravenous thrombolysis (rho = .276, P </= .001), and carotid endarterectomy (rho = .214, P </= .004); stroke quality measures such as venous thromboembolism prophylaxis during hospital stay (rho = .163, P </= .022), discharge from hospital on antithrombotic therapy (rho = .266, P </= .000), consideration for acute thrombolytic therapy (rho = .358, P </= .000), and antithrombotic therapy prescribed by end of hospital day 2 (rho = .334, P </= .000). However, there was no significant correlation between income classification and the access and affordability of antiplatelet agents, vitamin K antagonists and statins, anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation/flutter, statin medication, stroke education, and assessment for rehabilitation. Our study shows that it is possible to get an overview of stroke treatment measures in different countries by conducting an internet-based survey. The generalizability of the findings may be limited by the low survey response rate.","Aiyagari V, Pandey DK, Testai FD, Grysiewicz RA, Tsiskaridze A, Sacks C, Ogun Y, Ogunrin OA, Uthman BM, Lindsay P, Gorelick PB",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,2015 Feb,Stroke AND Indonesia
30834002,Positive Correlation between Left Hemisphere Lesion and Erectile Dysfunction in Post-Stroke Patients.,"BACKGROUND: Stroke is a serious health condition and the leading cause of disability, including erectile dysfunction (ED). The mechanisms and factors that predict ED in stroke are not fully elucidated. Several studies have shown a relationship between the location of the lesion in stroke with the onset of ED. The left hemispheric lesion was believed to disrupt the parasympathetic nervous system which is responsible for the regulation of erection. Stroke attack in this region therefore can be the underlying reason for ED. However, there are still contradictory findings in this area, and very few studies attempted to look at this problem, particularly among Asian male. AIM: We would like to evaluate the association between left hemisphere lesion after ischemic stroke and the subsequent risk of developing ED. METHODS: The study was conducted in the neurology polyclinic of Sanglah and Wangaya Hospital from February to August 2013. Subjects are all post-stroke patients who visited the neurology polyclinic of Sanglah and Wangaya Hospital that met inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS: There is a significant positive correlation (p < 0.05) between left hemisphere lesions and ED in stroke patients with a correlation coefficient (r) = 0.361 which means weak correlation and p = 0.032. CONCLUSION: Left hemisphere lesions positively correlated with ED in stroke patients. Further longitudinal research is needed to see whether left hemisphere lesion in post-stroke patients is a risk factor for ED.","Purwata TE, Andaka D, Nuartha A, Wiratni C, Sumada K",Open Access Maced J Med Sci,2019 Feb 15,Stroke AND Indonesia
30463501,Current state of acute stroke care in Southeast Asian countries.,"Acute stroke care systems in Southeast Asian countries are at various stages of development, with disparate treatment availability and practice in terms of intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular therapy. With the advent of successful endovascular therapy stroke trials over the past decade, the pressure to revise and advance acute stroke management has greatly intensified. Southeast Asian patients exhibit unique stroke features, such as increased susceptibility to intracranial atherosclerosis and higher prevalence of intracranial haemorrhage, likely secondary to modified vascular risk factors from differing dietary and lifestyle habits. Accordingly, the practice of acute endovascular stroke interventions needs to take into account these considerations. Acute stroke care systems in Southeast Asia also face a unique challenge of huge stroke burden against a background of ageing population, differing political landscape and healthcare systems in these countries. Building on existing published data, further complemented by multi-national interaction and collaboration over the past few years, the current state of acute stroke care systems with existing endovascular therapy services in Southeast Asian countries are consolidated and analysed in this review. The challenges facing acute stroke care strategies in this region are discussed.","Ng JC, Churojana A, Pongpech S, Vu LD, Sadikin C, Mahadevan J, Subramaniam J, Jocson VE, Lee W",Interv Neuroradiol,2019 Jun,Stroke AND Indonesia
32200394,Impact of Air Pollution and Seasonal Haze on Neurological Conditions.,"INTRODUCTION: Air pollution is a global problem and seasonal haze from forest clearing and peat land burning in Indonesia is an annual phenomenon in Southeast Asia. As neurological disorders comprise 6.3% of the burden of disease globally, we reviewed evidence of the association between common neurological conditions and air pollution exposure, and summarised existing data on the impact of the haze phenomenon in Southeast Asia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A PubMed search for relevant studies on air pollution, Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia, epilepsy, haze, headache, migraine, stroke, Parkinson's disease (PD) and neuromuscular conditions was performed. There were 52 articles which were relevant and were reviewed. RESULTS: There were associations between short-term air pollution exposure with AD, epilepsy, ischaemic stroke and migraine. Long-term air pollution exposure was associated with AD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, dementia and ischaemic stroke. Evidence on the link between air pollution and PD was inconsistent. Currently, there is no specific data on the effects haze has on neurological conditions in Southeast Asia. CONCLUSION: Air pollution is associated with increased risk of certain common neurological disorders. More specific studies are needed to investigate the impact of seasonal haze on neurological conditions in Southeast Asia.","Rocha II, Narasimhalu K, De Silva DA",Ann Acad Med Singap,2020 Jan,Stroke AND Indonesia
39888946,Young Adults Rehabilitation experiences and Needs following Stroke (YARNS): A scoping review of the rehabilitation care experiences and outcomes of young adults post-stroke.,"BACKGROUND: Stroke is one of the leading disabling conditions in the United Kingdom. While an increasing focus on the rehabilitation care for stroke survivors has been noted, practice guidelines, targets and services tend to be tailored for the elderly population rather than young adults. OBJECTIVES: This scoping review aimed to map the existing literature on the rehabilitation care experiences and outcomes of young adults post-stroke aged between 18 and 45 years within acute and social care settings. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A scoping review was conducted to identify existing practice and published academic and evidence-based literature related to the topic. Arksey and O'Malley's framework guided the review and reporting followed the PRISMA-ScR checklist. Electronic databases and grey literature were searched to capture the potentially recent and relevant literature available in English from year 2000-2022. The databases included CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ASSIA, AMED, PEDro, Cochrane Library and Web of Science. Grey literature was searched from the following sources: Google Scholar, websites of networks, organisations and charities related to stroke. Hand searches were performed on the reference lists of the included articles and grey literature to find relevant references. Data were extracted on young adults' experiences of stroke and rehabilitation care and their outcomes and experiences of a particular stroke rehabilitation programme in acute and social care settings. RESULTS: Eighty-five articles were included in this review. In most instances, stroke was reported to negatively impact young adults, although positive consequences were also documented. The focus and the outcomes of stroke rehabilitation were predominantly physical especially in the areas of movement, communication and memory. Young adults experienced a lack of age-adapted stroke rehabilitation in acute and social care settings. CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the unmet needs of young adults in their stroke recovery journey. Effective rehabilitation programmes and interventions should be developed to support young adults following stroke and meet their age-specific needs.","Chandler C, Clarissa C, Putri AF, Aviles L, Choi H, Hewitt J, Hennessy E, Noble H, Reid J, Holloway A, Kelly D",PLoS One,2025,Stroke AND Indonesia
38356890,A systematic-search-and-review of registered pharmacological therapies investigated to improve neuro-recovery after a stroke.,"BACKGROUND: Stroke burden is largely due to long-term impairments requiring prolonged care with loss of productivity. We aimed to identify and assess studies of different registered pharmacological therapies as treatments to improve post-stroke impairments and/or disabilities. METHODS: We performed a systematic-search-and-review of treatments that have been investigated as recovery-enhancing or recovery-promoting therapies in adult patients with stroke. The treatment must have received registration or market authorization in any country regardless of primary indication. Outcomes included in the review were neurological impairments and functional/disability assessments. ""The best available studies"" based on study design, study size, and/or date of publication were selected and graded for level of evidence (LOE) by consensus. RESULTS: Our systematic search yielded 7,801 citations, and we reviewed 665 full-text papers. Fifty-eight publications were selected as ""the best studies"" across 25 pharmacological classes: 31 on ischemic stroke, 21 on ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, 4 on intracerebral hemorrhage, and 2 on subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Twenty-six were systematic reviews/meta-analyses, 29 were randomized clinical trials (RCTs), and three were cohort studies. Only nimodipine for SAH had LOE A of benefit (systematic review and network meta-analysis). Many studies, some of which showed treatment effects, were assessed as LOE C-LD, mainly due to small sample sizes or poor quality. Seven interventions had LOE B-R (systematic review/meta-analysis or RCT) of treatment effects. CONCLUSION: Only one commercially available treatment has LOE A for routine use in stroke. Further studies of putative neuroprotective drugs as adjunctive treatment to revascularization procedures and more confirmatory trials on recovery-promoting therapies will enhance the certainty of their benefit. The decision on their use must be guided by the clinical profile, neurological impairments, and target outcomes based on the available evidence.

30962832,Comparison of Mean VEGF-A Expression Between Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients and Non-Ischemic Stroke Subjects.,"BACKGROUND: Glucose and oxygen supply to neurons are disrupted during acute ischemic stroke, resulting in hypoxia. This event, in turn, activates the transcription of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1), which is responsible for activating genes responsible for angiogenesis, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF and their receptor systems exert complex mechanisms of angiogenesis, including the stimulator, inhibitors, angiogenic and modulator. VEGF-A is the primary regulator of angiogenesis, both during physiological and pathological conditions. Nevertheless, the role of VEGF on the prognosis of hypoxia remains controversial. AIM: The purpose of this study was to address if there is any difference between the mean expression of VEGF-A between acute ischemic patients and non-ischemic stroke subjects. METHODS: This was an observational study with a cross-sectional design, the population in this research is the acute ischemic stroke patients and non-ischemic stroke subjects, which were admitted on Emergency Room and later treated in the Stroke Unit, Dr Sardjito General Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Subjects were recruited using the purposive method, yielding a total of 64 subjects on both groups. Diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke was established using a head CT scan. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and willing to participate in the study were asked to provide informed consent. Laboratory analysis was conducted during the first 24 hours after being treated at Stroke Unit, Dr Sardjito General Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia, with venous blood was withdrawn VEGF-A levels between acute ischemic stroke and non-ischemic stroke subjects were subsequently compared. Categorical variables (including gender) were tested using either chi-square or Fisher exact test. Interval data was examined using student t-test if data distribution was normal. RESULTS: As many as 35 acute ischemic stroke and 35 non-ischemic stroke patients were included in the study, among whom were 18 men (51.43%) and 17 women (48.57%) among stroke patients and 21 (60%) men and 14 (40%) women among subjects without stroke. The average of the subject's age on stroke and non-ischemic stroke group was 58.51 and 48.57 years old. VEGF-A levels were significantly higher in the non-stroke group (561.77 +/- 377.92) compared with stroke group (397.78 +/- 181.53) with p = 0.02. CONCLUSION: expression of VEGF-A in acute ischemic stroke group was lower when compared with the non-stroke group.","Setyopranoto I, Sadewa AH, Wibowo S, Widyadharma IPE",Open Access Maced J Med Sci,2019 Mar 15,Stroke AND Indonesia
38450211,Correlation of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and clinical outcome of acute thrombotic stroke in patients with COVID-19.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused millions of deaths worldwide. Acute ischemic stroke is a life-threatening risk factor for COVID-19 infection. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is one of the predictors of poor prognosis in acute ischemic stroke. The aim of this study was to assess the correlation between NLR values and the clinical outcome of acute thrombotic stroke patients with COVID-19 that was measured using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). A cross- sectional hospital-based study was conducted in Dr. Soetomo General Hospital Surabaya, Indonesia. Patients with acute thrombotic stroke and COVID-19 admitted between 1 March 2020 and 31 May 2021 were recruited. The NLR values and the NIHSS scores were assessed during the admission and the correlation between NLR and NIHSS scores was calculated. This study included 21 patients with acute thrombotic stroke and COVID-19, consisting of 12 males and 9 females. The mean age was 57.6 years old. The mean NLR values was 8.33+/-6.7 and the NIHSS scores ranging from 1 to 33. Our data suggested a positive correlation between NLR values and NIHSS scores, r=0.45 with p=0.041. In conclusion, the NLR value is potentially to be used as a predictor of the clinical outcome in acute thrombotic stroke patients with COVID-19. However, further study is warranted to validate this finding.","Sarengat RF, Islam MS, Ardhi MS",Narra J,2021 Dec,Stroke AND Indonesia
25113750,Global epidemiology of atrial fibrillation.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major public health burden worldwide, and its prevalence is set to increase owing to widespread population ageing, especially in rapidly developing countries such as Brazil, China, India, and Indonesia. Despite the availability of epidemiological data on the prevalence of AF in North America and Western Europe, corresponding data are limited in Africa, Asia, and South America. Moreover, other observations suggest that the prevalence of AF might be underestimated-not only in low-income and middle-income countries, but also in their high-income counterparts. Future studies are required to provide precise estimations of the global AF burden, identify important risk factors in various regions worldwide, and take into consideration regional and ethnic variations in AF. Furthermore, in response to the increasing prevalence of AF, additional resources will need to be allocated globally for prevention and treatment of AF and its associated complications. In this Review, we discuss the available data on the global prevalence, risk factors, management, financial costs, and clinical burden of AF, and highlight the current worldwide inadequacy of its treatment.","Rahman F, Kwan GF, Benjamin EJ",Nat Rev Cardiol,2014 Nov,Stroke AND Indonesia
31181010,Long-term Exposure to Low Air Pollutant Concentrations and the Relationship with All-Cause Mortality and Stroke in Older Men.,"BACKGROUND: Long-term air pollution exposure has been associated with increased risk of mortality and stroke. Less is known about the risk at lower concentrations. The association of long-term exposure to PM2.5, PM2.5 absorbance, NO2, and NOx with all-cause mortality and stroke was investigated in a cohort of men aged >/= 65 years who lived in metropolitan Perth, Western Australia. METHODS: Land use regression models were used to estimate long-term exposure to air pollutants at participant's home address (n = 11,627) over 16 years. Different metrics of exposure were assigned: baseline; year before the outcome event; and average exposure across follow-up period. The Mortality Register and Hospital Morbidity Data from the Western Australia Data Linkage System were used to ascertain mortality and stroke cases. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models, adjusting for age, smoking, education, and body mass index for all-cause mortality. For fatal and hospitalized stroke, the models included variables controlled for all-cause mortality plus hypertension. RESULTS: Fifty-four percent of all-participants died, 3% suffered a fatal stroke, and 14% were hospitalized stroke cases. PM2.5 absorbance increased the risk of all-cause mortality with adjusted HR of 1.12 (1.02-1.23) for baseline and average exposures, and 1.14 (1.02-1.24) for past-year exposure. There were no associations between PM2.5 absorbance, NO2, and NOx and stroke outcomes. However, PM2.5 was associated with reduced risks of fatal stroke. CONCLUSION: Long-term exposure to PM2.5 absorbance was associated with all-cause mortality among older men exposed to low concentrations; and exposure to PM2.5 was associated with reduced risk of fatal stroke.","Dirgawati M, Hinwood A, Nedkoff L, Hankey GJ, Yeap BB, Flicker L, Nieuwenhuijsen M, Brunekreef B, Heyworth J",Epidemiology,2019 Jul,Stroke AND Indonesia
39507294,The impact of thyroid disorder on cardiovascular disease: Unraveling the connection and implications for patient care.,"The thyroid gland is responsible for metabolism, as well as cardiac function and the peripheral vascular system. Thyroid dysfunctions are associated with an increase in the risk of cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure and coronary heart disease atrial fibrillation, by impairing heart contractility, stroke volume, heart rate, peripheral vascular resistance, and electrical activity. Thyroid dysfunctions also alter several cardiovascular risk factors, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, as well as causing stroke, which is associated with atrial fibrillation. An antiarrhythmic drug, amiodarone, may also induce both thyrotoxicosis and hypothyroidism, so its use requires serial thyroid function testing. Every CVD patient is recommended to be screened and treated for any possible thyroid dysfunction to reduce the patient's mortality and morbidity.","Soetedjo NNM, Agustini D, Permana H",Int J Cardiol Heart Vasc,2024 Dec,Stroke AND Indonesia
32567290,Combination of vitamin A and D supplementation for ischemic stroke: effects on interleukin-1ss and clinical outcome.,"Aim Accumulated evidence suggests that vitamin A and D agonists can alleviate the development of atherosclerosis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of vitamin A and D combination supplement on interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and clinical outcome in ischemic stroke. Methods A single-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted on ischemic stroke patients at Adam Malik Hospital between March 2018 to February 2019. The patients were randomized into 4 groups of the treatment consisting of supplementation using vitamin A or D only, combination of vitamin A and D, and placebo group, all given for 12 weeks. Clinical outcome was determined using the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). At the time of admission and after the treatment was completed, all patients were measured for vitamin A, vitamin D, and IL-1beta serum level, and NIHSS score. Results From the total of 120 patients, in the combination group there were significant increments on both vitamin A (p=0.04) and vitamin D (p=0.01) serum level after 12 weeks of the treatment, compared to the other groups. In conjunction, IL-1beta serum level showed a significant decrement in the combination group (p<0.001). Lastly, the biggest improvement of NIHSS could be seen in the combination group, which was marked by the highest decrement of NIHSS score (p<0.001). Conclusion Administration of combination of vitamin A and D supplementation can significantly increase vitamin A and D serum level, decrease IL-1beta serum level, and ultimately improve clinical outcome in ischemic stroke patients.","Kadri A, Sjahrir H, Juwita Sembiring R, Ichwan M",Med Glas (Zenica),2020 Aug 1,Stroke AND Indonesia
35871324,Association of coagulation factors profile with clinical outcome in patient with COVID-19 and acute stroke: A second wave cohort study.,"INTRODUCTION: The second wave of COVID-19 in Indonesia occurred due to delta variant transmission with up to 2266 cases. This variant could cause higher rate of morbidities and mortalities. This study reported coagulation profile of COVID-19 patients with acute stroke and its association with patients' outcome. METHOD: This is a cohort-retrospective study conducted during the second wave of COVID-19, June-August 2021 in Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital. Inclusion criteria were adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 and diagnosed with acute stroke confirmed by radiological evidences. Exclusion criteria were COVID-19 patients with prior diagnosis of acute stroke. Coagulation factors were analyzed and presented with tables and graphs. RESULTS: A total of 33 patients included in this study with majority experienced ischemic stroke (84.8%), followed by ischemic with haemorrhagic transformation (9.1%), and the rest with haemorrhagic stroke. The median of fibrinogen and D-dimer was 487.1(147-8,943)mg/dL and 2,110(250-35,200)ug/L respectively. Prothrombin time (PT) ratio was 0.95(0.82-1.3) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) ratio was 1.01(0.64-2.72). On observation, 33.3% died during hospitalization, D-dimer value in these patients was significantly higher with 9,940ug/L compared to those who survived with 1,160ug/L(p = 0.009). The highest D-dimer value during hospitalization was also significantly higher with the median of 14,395ug/L compared to 3,740 ug/L (p = 0.014). DISCUSSION: D-dimer value on initial assessment and its highest value during hospitalization were significantly higher in patient with poor outcome, showing that D-dimer can be one predictor of mortality in COVID-19 patients with acute stroke.","Rasyid A, Riyanto DL, Harris S, Kurniawan M, Mesiano T, Hidayat R, Wiyarta E",Clin Hemorheol Microcirc,2022,Stroke AND Indonesia
36275348,Rapid Atrial Fibrillation in the Emergency Department.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common rhythm disorder seen in doctors' offices and emergency departments (EDs). In both settings, an AF holistic pathway including anticoagulation or stroke avoidance, better symptom management, and cardiovascular and comorbidity optimization should be followed. However, other considerations need to be assessed in the ED, such as haemodynamic instability, the onset of AF, the presence of acute heart failure and pre-excitation. Although the Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support guidelines (European Society of Cardiology guidelines, Acute Cardiac Care Association/European Heart Rhythm Association position statements) and several recent AF publications have greatly assisted physicians in treating AF with rapid ventricular response in the ED, further practical clinical guidance is required to improve physicians' skill and knowledge in providing the best treatment for patients. Herein, we combine multiple strategies with supporting evidence-based treatment and experiences encountered in clinical practice into practical stepwise approaches. We hope that the stepwise algorithm may assist residents and physicians in managing AF in the ED.","Alsagaff MY, Susilo H, Pramudia C, Juzar DA, Amadis MR, Julario R, Raharjo SB, Dharmadjati BB, Lusida TTE, Azmi Y, Doevendans PA",Heart Int,2022,Stroke AND Indonesia
33680423,The Modifiable Risk Factors of Uncontrolled Hypertension in Stroke: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: This review aimed at figuring out the risk factors of uncontrolled hypertension in stroke. METHOD: This study systematically analyzed the hypertension risk factors available in the ProQuest, EBSCO, and PubMed databases published between 2010 and December 2019. The risk factors' pooled odds ratio (POR) included in this research was calculated using both fixed and random-effect models. The meta-data analysis was processed using the Review Manager 5.3 (Rev Man 5.3). RESULT: Of 1868 articles, seven studies were included in this review searched using specific keywords. Based on the analysis results, there were 7 risk factors of uncontrolled hypertension in stroke: medication nonadherence (POR = 2.23 [95% CI 1.71-2.89], p = 0.342; I (2) = 6.7%), use of antihypertensive drugs (POR = 1.13 [95% CI 1.19-1.59, p = 0.001; I (2) = 90.9%), stage of hypertension (POR = 1.14 [95% CI 1.02-1.27], p = <0.001; I (2) = 97.1%), diabetes mellitus (POR = 0.71 [95% CI 0.52-0.99], p = <0.001; I (2) = 96.5%), atrial fibrillation (POR = 1.74 [95% CI 1.48-2.04)], p = <0.001; I (2) = 93.1%), triglycerides (POR = 1.47 [95% CI 1.23-1.75], p = 0.879; I (2) = 0%), and age (POR = 1.03 [95% CI 0.89-1.18], p = <0.001; I (2) = 97.5%]. There were no bias publications among studies. Medication nonadherence and triglycerides had homogeneous variations, while the others had heterogeneous variations. CONCLUSION: Medication nonadherence, triglycerides, stage of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and use of antihypertensive drugs significantly affect the uncontrolled hypertension in stroke.","Upoyo AS, Setyopranoto I, Pangastuti HS",Stroke Res Treat,2021,Stroke AND Indonesia
38443384,Projection of diabetes morbidity and mortality till 2045 in Indonesia based on risk factors and NCD prevention and control programs.,"Diabetes Mellitus is one of the biggest health problems in Indonesia but the research on the disease's projection is still limited. This study aimed to make a projection model of prevalence and mortality of diabetes in Indonesia based on risk factors and NCD programs. The study was a quantitative non-experimental study through multiple linear regression models and system dynamics. The baseline projection was created by 2018 data and projections until 2045 involved the dynamization of risk factors and programs, population, and case fatality rate. The model was created from 205 districts data. This study used secondary data from Basic Health Research, BPJS Kesehatan, NCD programs, and Ministry of Health. The prevalence of diabetes in Indonesia is estimated to increase from 9.19% in 2020 (18.69 million cases) to 16.09% in 2045 (40.7 million cases). The prevalence will be lower to 15.68% (39.6 million) if interventions of programs were carried out, and to 9.22% (23.2 million) if the programs were added with prevention of risk factors. The projected number of deaths due to diabetes increases from 433,752 in 2020 to 944,468 in 2045. Deaths due to stroke among diabetes increases from 52,397 to 114,092 in the same period. Deaths from IHD among diabetes increase from 35,351 to 76,974, and deaths from chronic kidney disease among diabetes increase from 29,061 to 63,279. Diabetes prevalence and mortality in Indonesia rise significantly in Indonesia and can be reduced by intervention of several programs and risk factors. This study findings could be source of planning and evaluation of Diabetes prevention and control program at national and provincial level in the future related to risk factors control and program development.","Wahidin M, Achadi A, Besral B, Kosen S, Nadjib M, Nurwahyuni A, Ronoatmodjo S, Rahajeng E, Pane M, Kusuma D",Sci Rep,2024 Mar 5,Stroke AND Indonesia
29977554,Cerebral small vessel disease in Indonesia: Lacunar infarction study from Indonesian Stroke Registry 2012-2014.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stroke is the number one cause of morbidity and mortality in Indonesia. Lacunar infarction is one of cerebral small vessel disease spectrum. This study aimed to present stroke epidemiology in Indonesia and risk factors associated with cerebral small vessel disease. METHODS: A multicenter prospective cross-sectional study of 18 hospitals in Indonesia was conducted using Stroke Case Report Form from 2012 to 2014. Stroke was diagnosed based on clinical findings confirmed with non-contrast computed tomography of the brain. Subjects were classified into two large groups: ischemic (lacunar and non-lacunar) and hemorrhagic (intracranial and subarachnoid hemorrhage). Other risk factors were assessed on admission. RESULTS: We enrolled 5411 patients, of whom 3627 (67.03%) had ischemic stroke and 1784 (32.97%) had hemorrhagic stroke. Male patients were prevalent in both large groups, although found less in subarachnoid hemorrhage group. Among patients with hemorrhagic stroke, 1603 (89.54%) of them had intracerebral hemorrhage and 181 (10.46%) had subarachnoid hemorrhage. From 3627 ischemic stroke patients, 1635 (45.07%) of them had lacunar infarction. We found that age above 55 years old, male gender, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes were important risk factors associated with lacunar stroke (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Ischemic stroke was the leading cause of stroke in Indonesia. In total, 45% of the total ischemic stroke patients had lacunar infarction. Important risk factors associated with lacunar infarction were hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, age over 55, and male population.","Harris S, Kurniawan M, Rasyid A, Mesiano T, Hidayat R",SAGE Open Med,2018,Stroke AND Indonesia
32489085,Association between working memory impairment and activities of daily living in post-stroke patients.,"Aim Stroke is one of the leading causes of adult disability and functional impairment worldwide. Cognitive impairments including memory dysfunction are common after stroke and may have a negative impact to the functional status and activities of daily living (ADL). The study aimed to determine the impact of working memory impairment after stroke on ADL. Methods This cross-sectional study involved post-stroke patients who underwent neurologic examination and mini mental state examination (MMSE), forward digit span (FDS) and backward digit span (BDS) to assess cognitive function, and assessment of daily life activities (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) scales. Results This study included 38 patients, 23 (60.5%) males and 15 (39.5%) females. The mean MMSE, FDS and BDS scores were 24.60+/-4.49, 4.87+/-1.166 and 3.47+/-1.158, respectively. There were 17 (44.7%) patients with cognitive impairment (MMSE Score was lower than 24). The mean ADL and IADL scores were significantly higher in patients with cognitive impairment, showing greater dependency in this group of patients. There was a significant negative correlation between global cognitive function, working memory and ADL and IADL scores in post-stroke patients. Conclusion Cognitive impairment has a negative impact on daily life activities in post-stroke patients.","Irfani Fitri F, Fithrie A, S Rambe A",Med Glas (Zenica),2020 Aug 1,Stroke AND Indonesia
31061732,Biomarkers of Atrial Fibrillation: Which One Is a True Marker?,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmias and associated with the risk of stroke and death. Continuous development of the diagnostic tool and prognostic stratification may lead to optimal management of AF. The use of biomarkers in the management of AF has been grown as an interesting topic. However, the AF biomarkers are not yet well established in the major guidelines. Among these biomarkers, a lot of data show troponin and brain natriuretic peptides are promising for the prediction of future events. The troponin elevation in AF patients may not necessarily be diagnosed as myocardial infarction or significant coronary artery stenosis, and brain natriuretic peptide elevation may not necessarily confirm heart failure. Troponin T and troponin I may predict postoperative AF. Furthermore, troponin and brain natriuretic peptide gave better prognostic performance when compared with the risk score available today.","Ardhianto P, Yuniadi Y",Cardiol Res Pract,2019,Stroke AND Indonesia

Case 1 reports on COVID-19 patients without comorbidities, Case 2 with comorbidities, Case 3 with strokes in young patients, and Case 4 with strokes in elderly patients. All cases had abnormal coagulation and hemorheology factors with mixed outcomes. Coagulation and hemorheology factors tend to be higher in COVID-19 patients with acute stroke. The value of coagulation and hemorheology factors can be a prognostic outcome in COVID-19 patients with severe disease, especially in patients associated with acute stroke.","Rasyid A, Timan IS, Riyanto DL, Harris S, Kurniawan M, Mesiano T, Hidayat R, Wiyarta E",Clin Hemorheol Microcirc,2022,Stroke AND Indonesia
37092641,"Home rehabilitation using android-based system as booster on the independences of stroke patients in local government hospital in Aceh, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND AND AIM: The independence of stroke patients played the main role in not only preventing the asymptomatic attacks which delayed assistance but also enhancing their quality of life by reducing their dependence on family members or caregivers. However, the inaccessibility and expense of treatment prevented stroke patients from continuing their rehabilitation and exercise after returning home. Thus, the purpose of this study was to provide an efficient system for alternative home rehabilitation to boost the self-care Independence of stroke patients by designing Android-based home rehabilitation. METHODS: The quantitative research was conducted using a non-randomized trial where the patients were purposively sampled. 70 participants were joined and divided into two groups: the control and intervention groups. The intervention group will have SIMTROKE application on their smartphone as the home rehabilitation process where control group would not have SIMTROKE installed. The effect of home rehabilitation was assessed by univariate, bivariate analysis and the correlation matrix to analyze home rehabilitation effect to the participants' self independences. RESULTS: The result showed that the independent intervention in post-stroke patients has a significant effect on increasing the independence of stroke patients to improve their quality of life of stroke patients. The highest improvements were found in urination and toileting followed by defecation, dressing, active and phase motion range, self-care, stepping to stairs, mobilization, showering, and eating abilities. CONCLUSIONS: The result proved that home rehabilitation utilizing an Android-based system could be employed as an alternate method to assist stroke patients in improving their independence and quality of life.

34639601,Prevalence of Mental Health Disorders among Elderly Diabetics and Associated Risk Factors in Indonesia.,"This cross-sectional study aimed to explore mental health disorders (MHD) prevalence among elderly diabetics in Indonesia. Data were extracted from the 2018 national basic health survey in Indonesia (abbreviated as RISKESDAS). The survey involved households randomly selected from 34 provinces, 416 districts, and 98 cities in Indonesia, with 1,017,290 respondents. The number of subjects selected in this study was 2818 elderly diabetic subjects. MHD was determined by self-reporting assessment. Secondary data acquired from RISKESDAS 2018 data involved age, sex, urban-rural residence status, marital status, educational level, employment status, obesity, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, family history of MHD, and DM duration. Binary logistic regression with a backward stepwise method was used to analyze the risk factors related to MHD. MHD prevalence among elderly diabetics in Indonesia was 19.3%. Factors associated with MHD among elderly diabetics were being female (prevalence odds ratio (POR) = 1.64; 95% CI: 1.126-2.394), married (POR = 0.05; 95% CI: 0.031-0.084), less education (POR = 3.37; 95% CI: 1.598-10.355), and stroke (POR = 1.61; 95% CI: 1.183-2.269). MHD prevalence among elderly diabetics in Indonesia was 19.3%, suggesting that screening for psychological problems and educating elderly diabetic patients is essential. Unmarried female elderly diabetics with less education and stroke were altogether more likely to experience MHD.","Azam M, Sulistiana R, Fibriana AI, Savitri S, Aljunid SM",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2021 Sep 30,Stroke AND Indonesia
32041910,Targeting Inflammation and Immune System in Acute Myocardial Infarction.,"Over more than two decades, the concept of atherosclerosis has developed and lead to inflammatory hypothesis. Inflammation plays an important role on pathogenesis of atherothrombosis and coronary heart disease (CHD), including acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Although the management of ACS has been demonstrated to be beneficial for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (such as using statin and aspirin) and also seemed to have positive effect on inflammation, the identification of effective management, specifically targeting inflammation, has been not been comprehensively understood.The Canakinumab Anti-inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study (CANTOS) supported targeting inflammation as a potential effective treatment for chronic coronary heart disease. In the CANTOS study, canakinumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits interleukin-1beta, reduced the level of hsCRP and caused lower risk of composite endpoint of death due to cardiovascular diseases, myocardial infarct or stroke compared to placebo. However, non-specific anti-inflammatory treatment using methotrexate in the Cardiovascular Inflammation Reduction Trial (CIRT) study did not show any reduced hsCRP and demonstrated that there is no benefit associated with cardiovascular outcomes, which left us with a question whether direct intervention on inflammation could improve cardiovascular outcomes.",Alwi I,Acta Med Indones,2019 Oct,Stroke AND Indonesia
33083587,Clinical significance of Platelet-to-White Blood Cell Ratio (PWR) and National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) in acute ischemic stroke.,"INTRODUCTION: Ischemic stroke can occur due to disruption of blood and oxygen supply to brain tissue. White blood cells and platelets play an important role in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. Several studies have concluded that the lower the platelet count and the higher the number of white blood cells in ischemic stroke patients will result in a more severe stroke and had worsen prognosis. Platelet and white blood cells counts can be converted into Platelet-to-White Blood Cell Ratio (PWR) which is a comparison between the number of platelets and white blood cells, so the higher PWR will provide better clinical outcomes. Here, we examined correlation between PWR and clinical outcome in acute ischemic stroke using NIHSS tools. METHOD: This research method was a retrospective analytic from 503 medical records of ischemic stroke patients from January 2015 to December 2017. Ischemic stroke divided into 2 groups: cardioembolic stroke and atherothrombotic stroke based on medical records. We calculated PWR and National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) for assessing clinical outcome. Statistical significance calculated with Spearman rank test, ANOVA, and multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 391 research subjects consisting of 213 females (54.5%) and 178 males (45.5%). The mean age of 57.14 years, and 82% subjects had hypertension as risk factor. Mean PWR of atherothrombotic stroke subjects were higher than cardioembolic stroke (33.02 vs 26.73) but had lower mean of NIHSS (5.81 vs 10.31) and had strong negative significant correlation between PWR and NIHSS (r = -0.9603; p < 0.001). From logistic regression, we found that PWR and platelet was statistically significance correlate with NIHSS (p < 0.05). The coefficient if PWR is the highest (absolute value) among other independent variables.It shows that PWR has positive effect on clinical outcome using NIHSS tools in acute ischemic stroke patients. CONCLUSION: Cardioembolic stroke had higher PWR compared with atherothrombotic stroke. PWR had a strong correlation with NIHSS. The higher PWR will provide higher NIHSS and PWR has positive effect on clinical outcome using NIHSS tools in acute ischemic stroke patients.","Amalia L, Dalimonthe NZ",Heliyon,2020 Oct,Stroke AND Indonesia
37593547,A Single-Center Experience of Correlation of Pulse Pressure to Mortality of Stroke Hemorrhage Patients in Indonesia.,"INTRODUCTION: The relationship between pulse pressure and mortality in acute stroke hemorrhage patients is a subject of debate. To investigate this relationship in the Indonesian context, a study was conducted due to the increasing prevalence of stroke in the country. METHODS: The study sample consisted of 111 patients with acute stroke hemorrhage admitted to the hospital between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2019. Patients with sepsis, cancer, or other hematology disorders were excluded, as were those who were lost to follow-up. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 22, and correlations were evaluated between various patient characteristics and laboratory values. RESULTS: It was revealed that patients with a wider pulse pressure were more likely to die (adjusted odds ratio = 3,070) than those with a normal or constricted pulse pressure. CONCLUSION: Pulse pressure had an impact on the mortality of patients with acute hemorrhagic stroke.","Makkiyah FA, Dicha S, Nurrizzka RH",ScientificWorldJournal,2023,Stroke AND Indonesia
39618686,Non-Contrast MRI Sequences for Ischemic Stroke: A Concise Overview for Clinical Radiologists.,"Ischemic stroke is the second leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Due to the urgency of implementing immediate therapy, acute stroke necessitates prompt diagnosis. The current gold standards for vascular imaging in stroke include computed tomography angiography (CTA), digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). However, the contrast agents used in these methods can be costly and pose risks for patients with renal impairment or allergies. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of current MRI techniques and sequences for evaluating ischemic stroke, emphasizing the importance of non-contrast options and their clinical implications for radiologists in the diagnosis and management of ischemic stroke. Standard MRI sequences-such as T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), DWI-FLAIR mismatch, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)-are essential for determining infarct location, volume, and age. Additionally, incorporating susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) sequence aids in identifying signs of hemorrhagic transformation within the infarcted region. Advanced techniques like arterial spin labeling (ASL) can serve as a non-contrast alternative for mapping cerebral blood flow (CBF) and allowing for comparison between infarcted and healthy brain areas. Adding ASL to the routine sequence allows ASL-DWI mismatch analysis that is useful for quantifying salvageable tissue volume and facilitate timely recanalization, while time-of-flight (TOF) MRA and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) help assess venous thrombosis, stenosis, or arterial occlusions. Finally, MR spectroscopy can provide insights into critical brain metabolites, including N-acetylaspartate (NAA), and lactate (Lac) to determine patient prognosis. Current MRI technology provides a myriad of sequence options for the comprehensive evaluation of ischemic stroke without the need for contrast material. A thorough understanding of the advantages and limitations of each sequence is crucial for its optimal implementation in diagnosis and treatment.","Bachtiar NA, Murtala B, Muis M, Ilyas MI, Abdul Hamid HB, As'ad S, Tammasse J, Wuysang AD, Soraya GV",Vasc Health Risk Manag,2024,Stroke AND Indonesia
37295502,Trends in ischemic heart disease among females in low-and middle-income countries from 1990 to 2019.,"BACKGROUND: Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is a major contributor to mortality in low-and middle-income-countries (LMICs). However, trends in IHD in females in LMICs are not well described. METHODS: We analyzed the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study from 1990 to 2019 for males and females with IHD from the ten most-populous LMICs (India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Philippines, Egypt, Vietnam, Iran, and Afghanistan). RESULTS: In females, IHD incidence increased from 950,000 cases/year to 1.6 million/year, IHD prevalence increased from 8 million to 22.5 million (181% increase) and IHD mortality from 428,320 to 1,040,817 (143% increase). IHD accounted for 6.2% of all deaths among females in 1990, doubling to 13.2% in 2019. IHD mortality for each country increased with the greatest shift in AAPC seen in the Philippines (5.8%, 95% CI 5.4-6.1) and India (3.7%, 95% CI 3.0-4.4). Notably, reductions in ASMR were greater for males than females in Afghanistan, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and Nigeria. (all p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The burden of IHD among females in LMIC has increased considerably in LMICs from 1990 to 2019. While the ASMR from IHD across most countries is declining, this was not uniformly noted. Furthermore, several countries noted lesser improvement in ASMR among females compared to males.","Makuvire TT, Latif Z, Kumar P, Samad Z, Warraich HJ",Int J Cardiol,2023 Oct 1,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
31356129,Guiding Principles for Chronic Total Occlusion Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.,"Outcomes of chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) have improved because of advancements in equipment and techniques. With global collaboration and knowledge sharing, we have identified 7 common principles that are widely accepted as best practices for CTO-PCI.  1. Ischemic symptom improvement is the primary indication for CTO-PCI.  2. Dual coronary angiography and in-depth and structured review of the angiogram (and, if available, coronary computed tomography angiography) are key for planning and safely performing CTO-PCI.  3. Use of a microcatheter is essential for optimal guidewire manipulation and exchanges.  4. Antegrade wiring, antegrade dissection and reentry, and the retrograde approach are all complementary and necessary crossing strategies. Antegrade wiring is the most common initial technique, whereas retrograde and antegrade dissection and reentry are often required for more complex CTOs.  5. If the initially selected crossing strategy fails, efficient change to an alternative crossing technique increases the likelihood of eventual PCI success, shortens procedure time, and lowers radiation and contrast use.  6. Specific CTO-PCI expertise and volume and the availability of specialized equipment will increase the likelihood of crossing success and facilitate prevention and management of complications, such as perforation.  7. Meticulous attention to lesion preparation and stenting technique, often requiring intracoronary imaging, is required to ensure optimum stent expansion and minimize the risk of short- and long-term adverse events. These principles have been widely adopted by experienced CTO-PCI operators and centers currently achieving high success and acceptable complication rates. Outcomes are less optimal at less experienced centers, highlighting the need for broader adoption of the aforementioned 7 guiding principles along with the development of additional simple and safe CTO crossing and revascularization strategies through ongoing research, education, and training.","Brilakis ES, Mashayekhi K, Tsuchikane E, Abi Rafeh N, Alaswad K, Araya M, Avran A, Azzalini L, Babunashvili AM, Bayani B, Bhindi R, Boudou N, Boukhris M, Bozinovic NZ, Bryniarski L, Bufe A, Buller CE, Burke MN, Buttner HJ, Cardoso P, Carlino M, Christiansen EH, Colombo A, Croce K, Damas de Los Santos F, De Martini T, Dens J, Di Mario C, Dou K, Egred M, ElGuindy AM, Escaned J, Furkalo S, Gagnor A, Galassi AR, Garbo R, Ge J, Goel PK, Goktekin O, Grancini L, Grantham JA, Hanratty C, Harb S, Harding SA, Henriques JPS, Hill JM, Jaffer FA, Jang Y, Jussila R, Kalnins A, Kalyanasundaram A, Kandzari DE, Kao HL, Karmpaliotis D, Kassem HH, Knaapen P, Kornowski R, Krestyaninov O, Kumar AVG, Laanmets P, Lamelas P, Lee SW, Lefevre T, Li Y, Lim ST, Lo S, Lombardi W, McEntegart M, Munawar M, Navarro Lecaro JA, Ngo HM, Nicholson W, Olivecrona GK, Padilla L, Postu M, Quadros A, Quesada FH, Prakasa Rao VS, Reifart N, Saghatelyan M, Santiago R, Sianos G, Smith E, C Spratt J, Stone GW, Strange JW, Tammam K, Ungi I, Vo M, Vu VH, Walsh S, Werner GS, Wollmuth JR, Wu EB, Wyman RM, Xu B, Yamane M, Ybarra LF, Yeh RW, Zhang Q, Rinfret S",Circulation,2019 Jul 30,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia

Many factors can affect SE. However, studies on SE in CHD patients with Rasch Model analysis have not been carried out widely. PURPOSE: This study aims to identify the SE in self-care and its related factors that correlate SE among CHD patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study was conducted on 104 adult patients (>/=18 years) diagnosed with CHD. Selection of the sample using convenience sampling technique with several predetermined criteria. SE was measured using the SEQ-CHDM questionnaire, with high validity and reliability results. Data were analyzed using the Rasch model and chi-square test. RESULTS: The results showed that most respondents had a moderate SE (51.5%). Care units (p=0.003) and duration of illness (p=0.049) were significantly correlated to SE among patients with CHD. ""Maintaining an ideal body weight"" is the most challenging thing. On the other hand, stop smoking is the most confident thing to be performed by the respondents. CONCLUSION: We conclude that CHD patients in the acute care unit and patients with a duration of illness >6 months have a lower tendency for SE. Health interventions such as raising awareness about the disease, modifying health behavior, and immediately screening can improve patients' SE. Besides that, proper diagnosis and ongoing treatment are crucial to improving SE and CHD care outcomes.","Nuraeni A, Sugiharto F, Anna A, Sari E, Mirwanti R, Trisyani Y, Emaliyawati E",Vasc Health Risk Manag,2023,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
37207828,Microalbuminuria and mortality in individuals with coronary heart disease: A meta-analysis of a prospective study.,"AIM: Microalbuminuria has been elevated as an outcome predictor in cardiovascular medicine. However, due to the small number of studies investigating the association of microalbuminuria and mortality in the coronary heart disease (CHD) population, the prognosis value of microalbuminuria in CHD remains under debate. The objective of this meta-analysis was to investigate the relationship between microalbuminuria and mortality in individuals with CHD. METHOD: A comprehensive literature search was performed using Pubmed, EuroPMC, Science Direct, and Google Scholar from 2000 to September 2022. Only prospective studies investigating microalbuminuria and mortality in CHD patients were selected. The pooled effect estimate was reported as risk ratio (RR). RESULTS: 5176 patients from eight prospective observational studies were included in this meta-analysis. Individuals with CHD have a greater overall risk of all-cause mortality (ACM) [rR = 2.07 (95% CI = 1.70-2.44); p = 0.0003; I(2) = 0.0%] as well as cardiovascular mortality (CVM) [rR = 3.23 (95% CI = 2.06-4.39), p < 0.0001; I(2) = 0.0%]. Subgroup analysis based on follow-up duration and a subset of CHD patients were similarly associated with an increased risk of ACM. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis indicates that microalbuminuria is associated with a higher risk of mortality in individuals with CHD. Microalbuminuria can serve as a predictor of poor outcomes in CHD patients.","Govardi E, Yulianda D, Habib F, Pakpahan C",Indian Heart J,2023 Jul-Aug,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
37885940,Cell sheet transplantation for ischemic heart disease: a systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE: Cell sheet transplantation is emerging as an appealing alternative for ischemic heart disease patients as it potentially can increase stem cell viability and retention. But the outcomes and safety of this treatment are still limited in literature and the result varies widely. We conduct a systematic review to look at the efficacy and safety of this promising transplantation method. METHODS: A systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive literature search was undertaken using the PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases. Articles were thoroughly evaluated and analyzed. RESULTS: Seven publications about cell sheet transplantation for ischemic heart disease patients were included. The primary outcomes measured were left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class. Safety measurement was depicted by cardiac-related readmission and deaths. The follow-up time ranged from 3 to 36 months for clinical outcomes and 8.5 years for safety outcomes. Cell sheet transplantation showed improvement in LVEF and NYHA class in most studies. Cardiac-related readmission and adverse events of cell sheet transplantation range from 0 to 30.4%, all were nonfatal as no cardiac-related death was reported. Patient preoperative status seems can affect the patient's response to cell sheet therapy. CONCLUSION: Cell sheet transplantation can safely improve LVEF and NYHA class in ischemic heart disease patients, even in very low ejection fraction patients with unsuccessful standard therapy before. Further studies with better patient inclusion, larger population, and long-term follow-up required to confirm these results.","Thamrin AMH, Soetisna TW, Ramadhani ANE, Hendarto H",Indian J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,2023 Nov,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia

31754412,Evaluating the quality of evidence for diagnosing ischemic heart disease from verbal autopsy in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Mortality and cause of death data are fundamental to health policy development. Civil Registration and Vital Statistics systems are the ideal data source, but the system is still under development in Indonesia. A national Sample Registration System (SRS) has provided nationally representative mortality data from 128 sub-districts since 2014. Verbal autopsy (VA) is used in the SRS to obtain causes of death. The quality of VA data must be evaluated as part of the SRS data quality assessment. AIM: To assess the strength of evidence used in the assignment of Ischaemic Heart Disease (IHD) as causes of death from VA. METHODS: The sample frame for this study is the 4,070 deaths that had IHD assigned as the underlying cause in the SRS 2016 database. From these, 400 cases were randomly selected. A data extraction form and data entry template were designed to collect relevant data about IHD from VA questionnaires. A standardised categorisation was designed to assess the strength of evidence used to infer IHD as a cause of death. A pilot test of 50 cases was carried out. IBM SPSS software was used in this study. RESULTS: Strong evidence of IHD as a cause of death was assigned based on surgery for coronary heart disease, chest pain and two out of: sudden death, history of heart disease, medical diagnosis of heart disease, or terminal shortness of breath. More than half (53%) of the questionnaires contained strong evidence. For deaths outside health facilities, VA questionnaires for male deaths contained acceptable evidence in significantly higher proportions as compared to those for female deaths. (P < 0.001). Nearly half of all IHD deaths were concentrated in the 50-69 year age group (48.40%), and a further 36.10% were aged 70 years or more. Nearly two-thirds of the deceased were male (58.40%). Smoking behaviour was found in 44.11% of IHD deaths, but this figure was 73.82% among males. CONCLUSION: More than half of the VA questionnaires from the study sample were found to contain strong evidence to infer IHD as the cause of death. Results from medical records such as electrocardiograms, coronary angiographies, and load tests could have improved the strength of evidence and contributed to IHD cause of death diagnosis.","Zhang W, Usman Y, Iriawan RW, Lusiana M, Sha S, Kelly M, Rao C",World J Cardiol,2019 Oct 26,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
38414476,Trends of ischemic heart disease mortality attributable to smoking in the five countries with the highest number of smokers during 1990-2019: an age-period-cohort analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Smoking increases the risk of various cardiovascular diseases, including ischemic heart disease (IHD). This study aimed to assess the impact of age, period, and cohort on long-term trends in IHD mortality in China, India, Indonesia, the United States, and Russia, the five countries with the highest number of smokers, from 1990 to 2019. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The data were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2019, and the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) was calculated. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to assess the magnitude and direction of trends in smoking-attributable mortality from IHD. Age-period-cohort (APC) studies were used to estimate net drift (estimated annual percentage change (EAPC)s), local drift (age-specific EAPCs), and independent trends in age, period, and cohort effects. RESULTS: The analysis revealed a significant downward trend in ASMRs attributable to IHD as a result of smoking in the United States, India, and Russia. Indonesia and China showed an upward trend. Age effects were increasing for both country and sex, with China showing the most significant increase in the older age group; period effects were decreasing in all countries except Indonesia, and cohort effects were increasing only in Indonesia and China. CONCLUSIONS: From 1990 to 2019, mortality from IHD caused by smoking showed a downward trend in these five countries. However, the pattern of increased mortality from IHD in women caused by smoking warrants further study.","Tang S, Meng J, Zhao X, Sun W",Arch Med Sci,2024,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
30571343,Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides dorei Reduce Gut Microbial Lipopolysaccharide Production and Inhibit Atherosclerosis.,"BACKGROUND: It is increasingly recognized that gut microbiota play a pivotal role in the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Previously, we have reported that the abundance of genus Bacteroides is lower in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) than in patients without CAD with coronary risk factors or in healthy volunteers. However, it remains unclear which and how specific gut bacteria contribute to the progression of atherosclerosis. METHODS: We recruited patients with CAD patients and controls without CAD with coronary risk factors. We then compared gut microbial composition using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing in fecal samples to detect species with differential abundance between 2 groups. Subsequently, we used atherosclerosis-prone mice to study the mechanisms underlying the relationship between such species and atherosclerosis. RESULTS: Human fecal 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing revealed a significantly lower abundance of Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides dorei in patients with CAD. This significant differential abundance was confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Gavage with live B. vulgatus and B. dorei attenuated atherosclerotic lesion formation in atherosclerosis-prone mice, markedly ameliorating endotoxemia followed by decreasing gut microbial lipopolysaccharide production, effectively suppressing proinflammatory immune responses. Furthermore, fecal lipopolysaccharide levels in patients with CAD were significantly higher and negatively correlated with the abundance of B. vulgatus and B. dorei. CONCLUSIONS: Our translational research findings identify a previously unknown link between specific gut bacteria and atherosclerosis. Treatment with live B. vulgatus and B. dorei may help prevent CAD. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: https://upload.umin.ac.jp/cgi-open-bin/ctr_e/ctr_view.cgi?recptno=R000018051 .

39212219,Variation in secondary prevention of coronary heart disease: the INTERASPIRE study.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: INTERASPIRE is an international study of coronary heart disease (CHD) patients, designed to measure if guideline standards for secondary prevention and cardiac rehabilitation are being achieved in a timely manner. METHODS: Between 2020 and 2023, adults hospitalized in the preceding 6-24 months with incident or recurrent CHD were sampled in 14 countries from all 6 World Health Organization regions and invited for a standardized interview and examination. Direct age and sex standardization was used for country-level prevalence estimation. RESULTS: Overall, 4548 (21.1% female) CHD patients were interviewed a median of 1.05 (interquartile range .76-1.45) years after index hospitalization. Among all participants, 24.6% were obese (40.7% centrally). Only 38.6% achieved a blood pressure (BP) < 130/80 mmHg and 16.6% a LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) of <1.4 mmol/L. Of those smoking at hospitalization, 48% persisted at interview. Of those with known diabetes, 55.2% achieved glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of <7.0%. A further 9.8% had undetected diabetes and 26.9% impaired glucose tolerance. Females were less likely to achieve the targets: BP (females 36.8%, males 38.9%), LDL-C (females 12.0%, males 17.9%), and HbA1c in diabetes (females 47.7%, males 57.5%). Overall, just 9.0% (inter-country range 3.8%-20.0%) reported attending cardiac rehabilitation and 1.0% (inter-country range .0%-2.4%) achieved the study definition of optimal guideline adherence. CONCLUSIONS: INTERASPIRE demonstrates inadequate and heterogeneous international implementation of guideline standards for secondary prevention in the first year after CHD hospitalization, with geographic and sex disparity. Investment aimed at reducing between-country and between-individual variability in secondary prevention will promote equity in global efforts to reduce the burden of CHD.","McEvoy JW, Jennings C, Kotseva K, De Bacquer D, De Backer G, Erlund I, Vihervaara T, Lip GYH, Ray KK, Ryden L, Abreu A, Almahmeed W, Ambari AM, Ge J, Hasan-Ali H, Huo Y, Jankowski P, Jimenez RM, Li Y, Mahmood Zuhdi AS, Makubi A, Mbakwem AC, Mbau L, Navarro Estrada JL, Ogah OS, Ogola EN, Quintero-Baiz A, Sani MU, Sosa Liprandi MI, Tan JWC, Urina Triana MA, Yeo TJ, Ganly S, Adamska A, Wood D",Eur Heart J,2024 Oct 14,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia

Clinical and DRPs were documented prospectively by a clinical pharmacist, with DRPs classified using Version 6.2 of the DRP classification scheme of the Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe Foundation. The intervention consisted of a discussion of identified DRPs with physicians, patients, pharmaceutical logistics clerks, nurses and nutritionists. Following this, any subsequent clinical and DRPs were re-identified and further interventions were conducted as necessary. RESULTS: A total of 75 inpatients were included in the study. Pre-intervention, there were 443 DRPs and 202 clinical problems. The most frequent DRPs were adverse drug reactions (52.6%), followed by drug effects (41.8%). Most DRPs were of moderate severity and would have resulted in moderate consequences had the pharmacist not intervened. The interventions resulted in a significant reduction in the number of DRPs, type of DRPs and number of clinical problems (P <0.05 each). Patients with complications were 26.047 times more likely to have no reduction or an increased number of clinical problems compared to patients without complications (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: Clinical pharmacist interventions were found to reduce subsequent DRPs and clinical problems among CHD patients with at least one previous DRP.","Sagita VA, Bahtiar A, Andrajati R",Sultan Qaboos Univ Med J,2018 Feb,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
37179817,The Potential of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) as Biomarkers and Their Association with the Increased Risk of Coronary Heart Disease: A Systematic Review.,"Human genetic analyses and epidemiological studies showed a potential association between several types of gene polymorphism and the development of coronary heart disease (CHD). Many studies on this pertinent topic need to be investigated further to reach an evidence-based conclusion. Therefore, in this current review, we describe several types of gene polymorphisms that are potentially linked to CHD. A systematic review using the databases EBSCO, PubMed, and ScienceDirect databases was searched until October of 2022 to find relevant studies on the topic of gene polymorphisms on risk factors for CHD, especially for the factors associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The risk of bias and quality assessment was evaluated by Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidelines. From keyword search results, a total of 6243 articles were identified, which were subsequently narrowed to 14 articles using prespecified inclusion criteria. The results suggested that there were 33 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that can potentially increase the risk factors and clinical symptoms of CHD. This study also indicated that gene polymorphisms had a potential role in increasing CHD risk factors that were causally associated with atherosclerosis, increased homocysteine, immune/inflammatory response, Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL), arterial lesions, and reduction of therapeutic effectiveness. In conclusion, the findings of this study indicate that SNPs may increase risk factors for CHD and SNPs show different effects between individuals. This demonstrates that knowledge of SNPs on CHD risk factors can be used to develop biomarkers for diagnostics and therapeutic response prediction to decide successful therapy and become the basis for defining personalized medicine in future.","Sitinjak BDP, Murdaya N, Rachman TA, Zakiyah N, Barliana MI",Vasc Health Risk Manag,2023,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
32588060,"Multicentre, randomized comparison of two-stent and provisional stenting techniques in patients with complex coronary bifurcation lesions: the DEFINITION II trial.","AIM: The present study aimed to assess the benefits of two-stent techniques for patients with DEFINITION criteria-defined complex coronary bifurcation lesions. METHODS AND RESULTS: In total, 653 patients with complex bifurcation lesions at 49 international centres were randomly assigned to undergo the systematic two-stent technique (two-stent group) or provisional stenting (provisional group). The primary endpoint was the composite of target lesion failure (TLF) at the 1-year follow-up, including cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction (TVMI), and clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR). The safety endpoint was definite or probable stent thrombosis. At the 1-year follow-up, TLF occurred in 37 (11.4%) and 20 (6.1%) patients in the provisional and two-stent groups, respectively [77.8%: double-kissing crush; hazard ratio (HR) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30-0.90; P = 0.019], largely driven by increased TVMI (7.1%, HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.20-0.90; P = 0.025) and clinically driven TLR (5.5%, HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.19-1.00; P = 0.049) in the provisional group. At the 1 year after indexed procedures, the incidence of cardiac death was 2.5% in the provisional group, non-significant to 2.1% in the two-stent group (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.31-2.37; P = 0.772). CONCLUSION: For DEFINITION criteria-defined complex coronary bifurcation lesions, the systematic two-stent approach was associated with a significant improvement in clinical outcomes compared with the provisional stenting approach. Further study is urgently warranted to identify the mechanisms contributing to the increased rate of TVMI after provisional stenting.

34611066,The Validity and Reliability of the MacNew Heart Disease Health Related Quality of Life Questionnaire: The Indonesian Version.,"BACKGROUND: The MacNew heart disease health related quality of life tool is used widely in the cardiac populations to evaluate the impact of disease and intervention including rehabilitation. In addition to the English version, it is also available for several other languages except the Indonesian language. Therefore, the purpose of this study were 1) to translate the MacNew questionnaire from the English version to the Indonesian language and 2) to estimate the preliminary validity and reliability of the Indonesian MacNew for patients with coronary artery disease. METHODS: Forward and backward translation procedure was used to develop the Indonesian MacNew. The Indonesian MacNew was administered to 24 patients after one week of revascularization surgery. Reliability was assessed by internal consistency and test-retest reliability. To evaluate concurrent validity, the correlation of the compatible domain of the Indonesian MacNew and SF-36 was assessed. RESULTS: Internal consistency reliability of the Indonesian MacNew was confirmed with Cronbach's alpha of the global scale and all three subscales exceeding 0.95. Test- retest reliability was acceptable with intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.66 for the global score. Furthermore, an acceptable concurrent validity was established with statistically significant correlation between Indonesian MacNew and SF-36 (pearson correlation ranging from 0.47 to 0.71). CONCLUSION: The first results of the Indonesian MacNew indicate acceptable validity and reliability as a measurement tool to assess health related quality of life of Indonesian patients with coronary artery disease.","Basuki N, El-Ansary D, Hofer S, Dwiputra B, Nualnim N",Acta Med Indones,2021 Jul,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
39480378,Drug-Coated Balloon Angioplasty of the Side Branch During Provisional Stenting: The Multicenter Randomized DCB-BIF Trial.,"BACKGROUND: Side branch stenting is often required during provisional stenting, leading to suboptimal results. Drug-coated balloons (DCB) for the compromised side branch have emerged as an attractive strategy. However, the benefit of DCB for coronary bifurcations remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate whether DCB, compared with a noncompliant balloon (NCB), for the pinched side branch improves the outcomes of provisional stenting in patients with simple, true coronary bifurcations. METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized controlled trial, patients with true coronary bifurcations who had side branch diameter stenosis of >/=70% after main vessel stenting at 22 centers in China, Indonesia, Italy, and Korea were randomly assigned to either DCB or NCB intervention. The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiac events, a composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, or clinically driven target-lesion revascularization at the 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: Between September 8, 2020, and June 2, 2023, 784 patients with true coronary bifurcation lesions undergoing main vessel stenting and having a severely compromised side branch were randomly assigned to the DCB (n = 391) or NCB (n = 393) group. One-year follow-up was completed in all patients. The primary endpoint occurred in 28 patients in the DCB group and 49 patients in the NCB group (Kaplan-Meier rate: 7.2% vs 12.5%; HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.35-0.88; P = 0.013), driven by a reduction in myocardial infarction. There were no significant differences between groups in procedural success, crossover to a 2-stent approach, all-cause death, revascularization, or stent thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with simple and true coronary bifurcation lesions undergoing provisional stenting, main vessel stenting with a DCB for the compromised side branch resulted in a lower 1-year rate of the composite outcome compared with an NCB intervention for the side branch. The high rates of periprocedural myocardial infarction, which occurred early and did not lead to revascularization, are of unclear clinical significance.","Gao X, Tian N, Kan J, Li P, Wang M, Sheiban I, Figini F, Deng J, Chen X, Santoso T, Shin ES, Munawar M, Wen S, Wang Z, Nie S, Li Y, Xu T, Wang B, Ye F, Zhang J, Shou X, Chen SL",J Am Coll Cardiol,2025 Jan 7,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
25350528,Spirituality and Negative Emotions in Individuals With Coronary Heart Disease.,"Many individuals with coronary heart disease (CHD) experience disease-related anxiety, depressive symptoms, and anger. Spirituality may be helpful to cope with these negative emotions. Research findings on the role of spirituality in dealing with negative emotions are inconsistent. In this study, we examined the associations between 7 dimensions of spirituality (ie, meaningfulness, trust, acceptance, caring for others, connectedness with nature, transcendent experiences, and spiritual activities) and negative emotions among individuals with CHD in Indonesia, controlling for perceived social support as well as demographic and clinical characteristics. In total, 293 individuals with CHD were recruited from the 3 largest hospitals in Bandung, Indonesia. They completed the Spiritual Attitude and Involvement List, the Beck Depression Inventory-II, the Trait Anxiety Scale of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Multidimensional Anger Inventory, and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. Hierarchical linear regression analyses indicated that a higher overall level of spirituality was associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms, less anxiety, and less anger. Specifically, a higher level of trust was significantly associated with both less depressive symptoms and less anxiety. Higher levels of caring for others and spiritual activities were associated with less anxiety, and a higher level of connectedness with nature was associated with less anger. These findings underscore the importance of specific dimensions of spirituality as a potentially independent buffer against negative emotions in individuals with CHD.","Ginting H, Naring G, Kwakkenbos L, Becker ES",J Cardiovasc Nurs,2015 Nov-Dec,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
32912956,Health and productivity burden of coronary heart disease in the working Indonesian population using life-table modelling.,"OBJECTIVES: The impact of coronary heart disease (CHD) and its effect on work productivity at a population level remains unknown in Indonesia. This study estimates the health and productivity lost to CHD in terms of years of life, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and productivity-adjusted life years (PALYs). SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A life-table model was constructed to simulate the experiences of Indonesians currently aged 15-54 years (working age) with CHD, followed-up to 55 years (retirement age). The life-table analysis was then repeated assuming that the cohort did not have CHD. Differences in the results reflected the impact of CHD. Demographical, prevalence and mortality data were based on the 2017 Global Burden of Disease study and 2018 Indonesian National Health Survey. Costs, productivity indices and utilities were derived from published sources. The cost of each PALY was assumed to be equivalent to gross domestic product per equivalent full-time worker (US$11 765). Future costs and outcomes were discounted by 3% annually. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Differences in total deaths, years of life and PALYs represented the impact of CHD. RESULTS: At present, 1 954 543 (1.45%) Indonesians of working-age have CHD. By retirement age, it was estimated that CHD resulted in 32 492 (36.6%) excess deaths, 128 132 (0.5%) years of life lost, 2 331 495 (10.5%) QALYs lost and 1 589 490 (6.9%) PALYs lost. The economic impact of lost productivity amounted to US$33.3 billion, and healthcare costs to US$139 billion. CONCLUSION: The health and economic burden of CHD in Indonesia looms large. This highlights the importance of its prevention and control, strategies for which, if effective, will deliver financial return.","Uli RE, Satyana RPU, Zomer E, Magliano D, Liew D, Ademi Z",BMJ Open,2020 Sep 9,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
37591678,Understanding Arteriosclerotic Heart Disease Patients Using Electronic Health Records: A Machine Learning and Shapley Additive exPlanations Approach.,"OBJECTIVES: The number of deaths from cardiovascular disease is projected to reach 23.3 million by 2030. As a contribution to preventing this phenomenon, this paper proposed a machine learning (ML) model to predict patients with arteriosclerotic heart disease (AHD). We also interpreted the prediction model results based on the ML approach and deployed modelagnostic ML methods to identify informative features and their interpretations. METHODS: We used a hematology Electronic Health Record (EHR) with information on erythrocytes, hematocrit, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, leukocytes, thrombocytes, age, and sex. To detect and predict AHD, we explored random forest (RF), XGBoost, and AdaBoost models. We examined the prediction model results based on the confusion matrix and accuracy measures. We used the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework to interpret the ML model and quantify the contribution of features to predictions. RESULTS: Our study included data from 6,837 patients, with 4,702 records from patients diagnosed with AHD and 2,135 records from patients without an AHD diagnosis. AdaBoost outperformed RF and XGBoost, achieving an accuracy of 0.78, precision of 0.82, F1-score of 0.85, and recall of 0.88. According to the SHAP summary bar plot method, hemoglobin was the most important attribute for detecting and predicting AHD patients. The SHAP local interpretability bar plot revealed that hemoglobin and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration had positive impacts on AHD prediction based on a single observation. CONCLUSIONS: ML models based on real clinical data can be used to predict AHD.","Miranda E, Adiarto S, Bhatti FM, Zakiyyah AY, Aryuni M, Bernando C",Healthc Inform Res,2023 Jul,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia

37577291,Smartphone-Based Cardiac Rehabilitation Program Improves Functional Capacity in Coronary Heart Disease Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) reduces mortality and morbidity in coronary heart disease (CHD); however, patients show a lack of adherence to CR. Alternatively, telehealth interventions have shown promising results for improving target outcomes in CR. This study aimed to review the effect of smartphone-based CR on the functional capacity of CHD patients. A literature search was performed using PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library on 21 March, 2022 to find randomised controlled trials on smartphone usage in CR to improve functional capacity. Outcomes included maximal oxygen consumption (VO(2) max), a 6-min walk test (6-MWT), quality of life, smoking cessation, and modifiable risk factors. Eleven trials recruiting CHD patients were reviewed. Wearable devices connected to smartphone- or chat-based applications were commonly used for CR delivery. Most trials managed to provide exercise prescriptions, education on medication adherence and controlling risk factors, and psychosocial counselling through the intervention. Functional capacity improved significantly following smartphone-based CR in CHD patients compared to control groups, as measured by VO(2) max and 6-MWT; patients were more likely to quit smoking. Compared to traditional care, smartphones that delivered CR to CHD patients demonstrate superior outcomes regarding increasing functional capacity. There is no significant improvement on lipid profile, blood pressure, HbA1C, body mass index, and quality of life. It can be used either alone or as an adjunct. Ultimately, the patients' preferences and circumstances should be considered.","Dwiputra B, Santoso A, Purwowiyoto BS, Radi B, Ambari AM, Desandri DR, Fatrin S, Pandhita BAW",Glob Heart,2023,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
38100501,Explaining the increase of incidence and mortality from cardiovascular disease in Indonesia: A global burden of disease study analysis (2000-2019).,"BACKGROUND: In the last two decades, there has been a discernible shift in the distribution of mortality attributed to cardiovascular disease (CVD) between developing and developed nations; in developed nations, the percentage of deaths caused by CVD decreased from 48% in 1990 to 43% in 2010, while in developing nations, they increased from 18% to 25%. In Indonesia, CVD death has increased substantially and remained elevated in the last ten years. Current behavioral and metabolic risk factors, including hyperglycemia, obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and smoking, enhance the risk of CVD mortality, according to several studies. AIMS: We undertook a study to determine whether the increase in mortality and incidence of CVD can be attributed to changes in the most common metabolic and behavioral risk factors from 2000 to 2019 across 34 Indonesian provinces. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 34 province for CVD incidence and mortality and data on changes in metabolic and behavioural risk factors between 2000 and 2019 in Indonesia were obtained from the Global Burden study (GBD) by The Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). A statistical model was applied to calculate the fatalities attributable to the risk factors change using Population attributable fractions (PAF) and baseline year death numbers. Furthermore, we ran multivariate regressions on Summary Exposure Value of risk factors associated with the increasing mortality, incidence rates in a lag year analysis. R software used to measure heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors with coeftest and coefci. Covariates were added to adjusted models, including the Socio-demographic Index, Primary health care facilities coverage, and GDP per capita. RESULTS: The age-standardized mortality rate for CVD from 2000 to 2019 in Indonesia, increased from 356.05 to 412.46 deaths per 100,000 population among men and decreased from 357.52 to 354.07 deaths per 100,000 population among women, resulting in an increase of 270.928 per 100,0000 inhabitants of CVD deaths. In the same period, there was an increase in exposure to risk factors such as obesity by +9%, smoking by +1%, dyslipidemia by +1.3%, hyperglycemia by +2%, and hypertension by +1.2%. During this time span, an additional 14,517 men and 17,917 women died from CVD, which was attributable to higher obesity exposure. We apply multivariate regression with province-fixed and year-fixed analysis and find strong correlation between hyperglycemia in women (6; 95%CI 0 to 12, death per 1-point increase in hyperglycemia exposure) with an increasing death rate in ischemic heart disease. We also performed a year lag analysis and discovered a robust association between high low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in men and women and the growing incidence of ischemic heart disease. The association between a 10-year lag of high LDL and the incidence of ischemic heart disease was five times stronger than that observed for other risk factors, particularly in men (5; 95%CI 2 to 8, incidence per 1-point increase in high LDL exposure). CONCLUSION: Hyperglycemia in women is an important risk factor associated with increasing mortality due to Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) in Indonesia This study also revealed that the presence of high LDL in both men and women were associated with an increase incidence of IHD that manifested several years subsequent to exposure to the risk factor. Additionally, the highest cardiovascular death portion were attributed to obesity. These findings suggest that policymakers should control high LDL and hyperglycemia 10 years earlier prior to the occurrence of IHD and employ personalized therapy to regulate associated risks.","Harmadha WSP, Muharram FR, Gaspar RS, Azimuth Z, Sulistya HA, Firmansyah F, Multazam CECZ, Harits M, Putra RM",PLoS One,2023,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
15563444,"Dietary intake and the risk of coronary heart disease among the coconut-consuming Minangkabau in West Sumatra, Indonesia.","Several nutrition and non-nutritional pathways are recognised in the development and occurrence of cardiovascular disease. In many populations, high intakes of saturated fat are associated with elevated serum cholesterol concentrations and increased coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality. However, several studies report that hyperlipidaemia and heart diseases are not common among populations who consume coconut, a source of saturated fat. A case-control study was conducted among the Minangkabau known to be high coconut consumers to examine the difference in food patterns and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) between the coronary cases and their gender- and age-matched apparently healthy counterparts serving as controls. Eligible subjects with CHD were identified through the co-operation of five participating hospitals located in Padang and Bukittinggi in West Sumatra, Indonesia. A total of 93 eligible cases (62 men and 31 women) in the Case group and 189 subjects (113 men and 76 women) in the Control group were recruited. Information on the intakes of individual foods and dishes over the preceding 12 months was obtained using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. The Case groups had significantly higher intakes of meats, eggs, sugar, tea, coffee and fruits, but lower intakes of soy products, rice and cereals compared to the controls. Coconut consumption as flesh or milk was not different between cases and controls. The cases had significantly higher intakes of protein and cholesterol, but lower intake of carbohydrate. Similar intakes of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids between the cases and controls indicated that the consumption of total fat or saturated fat, including that from coconut, was not a predictor for CHD in this food culture. However, the intakes of animal foods, total protein, dietary cholesterol and less plant derived carbohydrates were predictors of CHD.","Lipoeto NI, Agus Z, Oenzil F, Wahlqvist M, Wattanapenpaiboon N",Asia Pac J Clin Nutr,2004,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia

However, no previous study has examined the left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV GLS) parameter that represents LV contractile function. We investigated whether trimetazidine could improve the LV GLS value in patients with HFrEF due to IHD. We performed a double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) including 26 patients with HFrEF due to stable IHD who were given modified-release trimetazidine 35 mg twice per day (n = 13) or placebo (n = 13) for 3 months in addition to standard medication. Left ventricular systolic function including GLS values was assessed at baseline and after 3 months using echocardiography. A total of 25 participants (13 control and 12 trimetazidine groups) were recruited with a baseline average age of 57.1 +/- 10 years, and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) value of 34.6% +/- 4.4%, and a GLS value of 7.4% +/- 2.1%. Baseline clinical characteristics and echocardiogram were similar between the two groups. There was significant GLS improvement in the trimetazidine group (-6.9% +/- 2.4% to -8.4% +/- 2.6%, p = 0.000), but no significant differences were noted in the control group. The GLS improvement was significantly higher in the trimetazidine group than the control (1.5% + 0.9% vs. -0.7% + 1.7%, p = 0.001). No adverse drug reactions from the administration of trimetazidine in this study. Trimetazidine may improve GLS values in patients with HFrEF due to IHD.","Harjoko RP, Sobirin MA, Uddin I, Bahrudin U, Maharani N, Herminingsih S, Tsutsui H",Drug Discov Ther,2022 Sep 17,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia

27609056,"The double burden of disease among mining workers in Papua, Indonesia: at the crossroads between Old and New health paradigms.","BACKGROUND: As the global shift toward non-communicable diseases overlaps with the unfinished agenda of confronting infectious diseases in low- and middle-income countries, epidemiological links across both burdens must be recognized. This study examined the non-communicable disease-infectious disease overlap in the specific comorbidity rates for key diseases in an occupational cohort in Papua, Indonesia. METHODS: Diagnosed cases of ischaemic heart disease, stroke, hypertension, diabetes (types 1 and 2), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, cancer, HIV and AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria were extracted from 22,550 patient records (21,513 men, 1037 women) stored in identical electronic health information systems from two clinic sites in Papua, Indonesia. Data were collected as International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, entries from records spanning January-December 2013. A novel application of Circos software was used to visualize the interconnectedness between the disease burdens as overlapping prevalence estimates representing comorbidities. RESULTS: Overall, NCDs represented 38 % of all disease cases, primarily in the form of type 2 diabetes (n = 1440) and hypertension (n = 1398). Malaria cases represented the largest single portion of the disease burden with 5310 recorded cases, followed by type 2 diabetes with 1400 cases. Tuberculosis occurred most frequently alongside malaria (29 %), followed by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (19 %), asthma (17 %), and stroke (12 %). Hypertension-tuberculosis (4 %), tuberculosis-cancer (4 %), and asthma-tuberculosis (2 %) comorbidities were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of multimorbidity, preponderance of non-communicable diseases, and extensive interweaving of non-communicable and infectious disease comorbidities highlighted in this cohort of mining workers in Papua, Indonesia reflect the markedly double disease burden increasingly plaguing Indonesia and other similar low- and middle-income countries - a challenge with which their over-stretched, under-resourced health systems are ill-equipped to cope. Integrated, person-centered treatment and control strategies rooted in the primary healthcare sector will be critical to reverse this trend.","Rodriguez-Fernandez R, Ng N, Susilo D, Prawira J, Bangs MJ, Amiya RM",BMC Public Health,2016 Sep 8,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia

31039155,Cardiovascular disease risk factor prevalence and estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk scores in Indonesia: The SMARThealth Extend study.,"BACKGROUND: The brunt of cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden globally now resides within low- and middle-income countries, including Indonesia. However, little is known regarding cardiovascular health in Indonesia. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of elevated CVD risk in a specific region of Indonesia. METHODS: We conducted full household screening for cardiovascular risk factors among adults aged 40 years and older in 8 villages in Malang District, East Java Province, Indonesia, in 2016-2017. 10-year cardiovascular risk scores were calculated based on the World Health Organization/International Society of Hypertension's region-specific charts that use age, sex, blood pressure, diabetes status and smoking behaviour. RESULTS: Among 22,093 participants, 6,455 (29.2%) had high cardiovascular risk, defined as the presence of coronary heart disease, stroke or other atherosclerotic disease; estimated 10-year CVD risk of >/= 30%; or estimated 10-year CVD risk between 10% to 29% combined with a systolic blood pressure of > 140 mmHg. The prevalence of high CVD risk was greater in urban (31.6%, CI 30.7-32.5%) than in semi-urban (28.7%, CI 27.3-30.1%) and rural areas (26.2%, CI 25.2-27.2%). Only 11% and 1% of all the respondents with high CVD risk were on blood pressure lowering and statins treatment, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: High cardiovascular risk is common among Indonesian adults aged >/=40 years, and rates of preventive treatment are low. Population-based and clinical approaches to preventing CVD should be a priority in both urban and rural areas.","Maharani A, Sujarwoto, Praveen D, Oceandy D, Tampubolon G, Patel A",PLoS One,2019,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
28450656,Regulatory T Cell Immunity in Atherosclerosis.,"Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disorder involving innate and adaptive immunity process. Effector T cell (Teff) responses promote atherosclerotic disease, whereas regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been shown to play a protective role against atherosclerosis by down-regulating inflammatory responses which include multiple mechanisms. Compelling experimental data suggest that shifting the Treg/Teff balance toward Tregs may be a possible therapeutic approach for atherosclerotic disease, although the role of Tregs in human atherosclerotic disease has not been fully elucidated. In this review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the roles of Tregs and Teffs in experimental atherosclerosis, as well as human coronary artery disease.","Amin HZ, Sasaki N, Hirata KI",Acta Med Indones,2017 Jan,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
38606605,Key lifestyles and health outcomes across 16 prevalent chronic diseases: A network analysis of an international observational study.,"BACKGROUND: Central and bridge nodes can drive significant overall improvements within their respective networks. We aimed to identify them in 16 prevalent chronic diseases during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to guide effective intervention strategies and appropriate resource allocation for most significant holistic lifestyle and health improvements. METHODS: We surveyed 16 512 adults from July 2020 to August 2021 in 30 territories. Participants self-reported their medical histories and the perceived impact of COVID-19 on 18 lifestyle factors and 13 health outcomes. For each disease subgroup, we generated lifestyle, health outcome, and bridge networks. Variables with the highest centrality indices in each were identified central or bridge. We validated these networks using nonparametric and case-dropping subset bootstrapping and confirmed central and bridge variables' significantly higher indices through a centrality difference test. FINDINGS: Among the 48 networks, 44 were validated (all correlation-stability coefficients >0.25). Six central lifestyle factors were identified: less consumption of snacks (for the chronic disease: anxiety), less sugary drinks (cancer, gastric ulcer, hypertension, insomnia, and pre-diabetes), less smoking tobacco (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), frequency of exercise (depression and fatty liver disease), duration of exercise (irritable bowel syndrome), and overall amount of exercise (autoimmune disease, diabetes, eczema, heart attack, and high cholesterol). Two central health outcomes emerged: less emotional distress (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, eczema, fatty liver disease, gastric ulcer, heart attack, high cholesterol, hypertension, insomnia, and pre-diabetes) and quality of life (anxiety, autoimmune disease, cancer, depression, diabetes, and irritable bowel syndrome). Four bridge lifestyles were identified: consumption of fruits and vegetables (diabetes, high cholesterol, hypertension, and insomnia), less duration of sitting (eczema, fatty liver disease, and heart attack), frequency of exercise (autoimmune disease, depression, and heart attack), and overall amount of exercise (anxiety, gastric ulcer, and insomnia). The centrality difference test showed the central and bridge variables had significantly higher centrality indices than others in their networks (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: To effectively manage chronic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic, enhanced interventions and optimised resource allocation toward central lifestyle factors, health outcomes, and bridge lifestyles are paramount. The key variables shared across chronic diseases emphasise the importance of coordinated intervention strategies.","Li J, Fong DYT, Lok KYW, Wong JYH, Man Ho M, Choi EPH, Pandian V, Davidson PM, Duan W, Tarrant M, Lee JJ, Lin CC, Akingbade O, Alabdulwahhab KM, Ahmad MS, Alboraie M, Alzahrani MA, Bilimale AS, Boonpatcharanon S, Byiringiro S, Hasan MKC, Schettini LC, Corzo W, De Leon JM, De Leon AS, Deek H, Efficace F, El Nayal MA, El-Raey F, Ensaldo-Carrasco E, Escotorin P, Fadodun OA, Fawole IO, Goh YS, Irawan D, Khan NE, Koirala B, Krishna A, Kwok C, Le TT, Leal DG, Lezana-Fernandez MA, Manirambona E, Mantoani LC, Meneses-Gonzalez F, Mohamed IE, Mukeshimana M, Nguyen CTM, Nguyen HTT, Nguyen KT, Nguyen ST, Nurumal MS, Nzabonimana A, Omer NAMA, Ogungbe O, Poon ACY, Resendiz-Rodriguez A, Puang-Ngern B, Sagun CG, Shaik RA, Shankar NG, Sommer K, Toro E, Tran HTH, Urgel EL, Uwiringiyimana E, Vanichbuncha T, Youssef N",J Glob Health,2024 Apr 12,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
33175218,Drug-eluting balloon: is it useful?,"BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease is one of the major issues in the medical world around the globe. The prevalence tends to increase. The use of coronary intervention is one of the ways often used in the management of coronary artery disease due to its satisfying result from earlier studies. Nowadays, there are several different techniques in coronary intervention: balloon vs stent. MAIN BODY: The stent-based vascular interventions are increasingly being used over balloon-based coronary intervention. However, revascularization intervention using stent often have undesirable long-term effects compared to balloon. Besides, stent-based interventions are also considered more expensive, use more complicated techniques, and use more drug regimens. On the other hand, percutaneous coronary intervention techniques using balloons coated by anti-proliferation drugs have begun to be glimpsed by many interventionists. Studies have found many benefits that cannot be given by stent-based intervention therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Angioplasty using percutaneous coronary intervention techniques reveals satisfying result compared to conservative medical treatment. The indication and technique of percutaneous coronary intervention is still evolving until now. Currently, percutaneous coronary intervention using stent, either bare-metal stent or drug-eluting stent, is preferred by interventionist. Nevertheless, recent clinical trial favors the using of drug-eluting balloon for percutaneous coronary intervention in terms of both clinical outcome and complication in several scenarios.","Laksono S, Setianto B, Surya SP",Egypt Heart J,2020 Nov 11,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
34306870,Tachycardia and Pre-existing Chronic Kidney Disease Are Predictors of the Worse Clinical Outcomes in Patients Recently Hospitalized With Acute Heart Failure.,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the factors contributing to the outcomes of recently hospitalized patients with heart failure (HF). METHODS: A prospective data of 76 adults who were admitted due to acute HF between October 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020 at our center were analyzed. Endpoints included survival and rehospitalization within six months after discharge. RESULTS: The mean age was 64.9 +/- 13.8 years, with a male preponderance (68.4%). Approximately 60.5% of patients had the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <40%, whereas 26.3% of patients had LVEF >/=50%. Coronary artery disease (75%), arterial hypertension (72.4%), chronic kidney disease (46.1%), and diabetes mellitus (46.1%) were the most frequent comorbidities. Poor compliance (40.8%) and non-cardiac infection (21.1%) were the common precipitating factors for hospitalization. The majority of subjects had severe symptoms, indicated by the frequent need of intensive care unit (43%), high N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide levels [NT-proBNP; median, 4765 (1539.7-11782.2) pg/mL], and presence of either atrial fibrillation, severe mitral regurgitation, or significant pulmonary hypertension in approximately one-third of cases. Even though in-hospital mortality was relatively low (2.6%), the all-cause mortality and rehospitalization rates in the next six months after discharge were still high, reaching 22.54% and 19.72%, respectively. Further survival analysis showed that tachycardia on admission and pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) resulted in low six-month survival rates among these patients. CONCLUSION: After hospital discharge, patients with HF were still exposed to higher risks of death and readmission albeit with the medication addressed. Tachycardia on admission and pre-existing CKD might predict worse outcomes.","Suciadi LP, Wibawa K, Jessica G, Henrina J, Cahyadi I, Santi BT, Hariadi TK, Tedjasukmana F, Kristanti NM, Pakpahan EF, Manullang RA, Sutandar A",Cureus,2021 Jun,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
37965056,A Scoping Review of Predictors Associated with Self-Efficacy Among Patients with Coronary Heart Disease.,"Self-efficacy (SE) is the main predictor of self-care behaviour in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Several studies identified factors that influence SE in CHD patients. However, review studies have yet to synthesize these results systematically. This review aims to identify SE and the factors influencing SE in CHD patients. This scoping review is reported based on the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). We searched using relevant keywords using five databases: CINAHL Plus with Full Text and Academic Search Complete, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Taylor and Francis, and one search engine: Google Scholar, which was accessed on June 23, 2023. Articles with an observational design were included without date restrictions. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist, and data synthesis used thematic analysis. We found 11 articles discussing SE and the factors influencing SE in CHD patients. In this review, most studies reported that the SE level of CHD patients tends to be low to moderate. Factors associated with SE in this population are classified into three categories (low, moderate, and high). Cardiac knowledge and patient activation are the most influential predictors of SE in CHD patients. Public health interventions such as raising awareness about heart disease, modifying health behaviours, early screening, diagnosis, and appropriate treatment are critical to improving SE and cardiac care outcomes.","Sugiharto F, Nuraeni A, Trisyani Y, Putri AM, Armansyah NA, Zamroni AH",Vasc Health Risk Manag,2023,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
35178257,Abnormal Sleep Duration as Predictor for Cardiovascular Diseases: A Systematic Review of Prospective Studies.,"METHODS: We searched the online database PubMed on 30 August 2020 for our data collection. We used the following keywords: sleep duration AND (cardiovascular disease OR cardiovascular event) AND (cohort OR prospective OR retrospective). We identified 653 studies, and after excluding studies that were published before 2015, we obtained 306 studies. After filtering the 306 studies through title and abstract screening and applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we further reviewed fourteen studies with full-text reading. We excluded three studies because of insufficient data required and included eleven studies in this systematic review. RESULTS: A total of 361,041 participants from ten studies were included in this systematic review. The incidence of hypertension, myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, heart failure, cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular diseases in the short sleep duration group is 46.12%, 0.59%, 5.43%, 0.09%, 7.18%, 1.48%, and 6.8%, consecutively, while the incidence of hypertension, myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, and heart failure in the long sleep duration group is 30.71%, 0.61%, 6.55%, 1.11%, and 6.04%, consecutively. Nine studies reported an association between sleep duration and cardiovascular diseases while one study reported no association. Seven studies reported that short sleep duration was significantly associated with CVD. Short sleep duration in this study was associated with hypertension and heart failure. Atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease were associated with both short and long sleep duration. CONCLUSION: Abnormal sleep duration (short and long sleep duration) may act as the predictor of cardiovascular diseases. The importance of having normal sleep duration should be stressed with other lifestyle modification to avoid the risk of getting cardiovascular diseases. However, further studies are needed to overcome the limitation of this systematic review.","Laksono S, Yanni M, Iqbal M, Prawara AS",Sleep Disord,2022,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
35503933,Coronary stent infection: a systematic review.,"Coronary stent infection (CSI) is the rarest complication associated with the percutaneous coronary intervention, occurring in less than 0.1% of cases. So far, all reported instances are limited to case reports. CSI presents itself in various, often confusing, ways in clinical settings. Therefore, the current systematic review summarizes reports of CSI's clinical presentations, causative pathogens, diagnoses and treatments. This systematic review considered three online databases, using reference lists as an additional source. All case reports or case series with stent infection in the coronary artery were included - however, reviews or commentaries, articles not published in English, and articles mentioning a history of hemodialysis or any surgery were excluded. Thirty-two studies on 34 CSI patients were included in the final qualitative analysis. CSI predominantly affected males of a wide range of ages. The most common symptoms were chest pain and fever with various onsets. Interestingly, CSI usually occurred during the first stent implantation. Cultures and coronary angiography were the most common methods used to diagnose CSI. Furthermore, drug-eluting stents had a higher risk of infection than bare-metal stents. Aneurysms were the most frequent abnormalities observed in infected stents. The bacteria that most often caused CSI were Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeroginosa. More than 90% of the reports mentioned using various antibiotics, and 74% mentioned carrying out surgery. Finally, a mortality rate of 26.47% among CSI patients was calculated.","Suryawan IGR, Luke K, Agustianto RF, Mulia EPB",Coron Artery Dis,2022 Jun 1,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia

Genetic factors can affect a person's risk of CAD, which affects one-third of the population. This study investigated the role of IL-6 -572 C/G, CRP -757 A/G, and CRP -717 T/C gene polymorphisms. IL-6 and CRP levels on the severity of periodontitis in CAD in Indonesia were also evaluated. This case-control study was conducted with mild and moderate-severe chronic periodontitis groups. A path analysis test was conducted with Smart PLS with a 95% confidence interval to determine the significant variable for chronic periodontitis. Our study revealed that the effects of IL-6 -572 C/G, CRP -757 A/G, and CRP -717 T/C gene polymorphisms on IL-6 levels and CRP levels were not significant. IL-6 and CRP levels were not significantly different between the two groups. We found that IL-6 levels had a significant effect on CRP levels in periodontitis patients with CAD (path coefficient 0.322, p = 0.003). IL-6 -572 C/G, CRP -757 A/G, and CRP -717 T/C gene polymorphisms had no effect on the severity of chronic periodontitis in CAD patients in the Indonesian population. We also observed no apparent effects of the influence of gene polymorphisms in IL-6 -572 C/G, CRP -757 A/G, and CRP -717 T/C genes. Although the IL-6 and CRP levels were not significantly different between the two groups, IL-6 levels affected CRP levels in periodontitis patients with CAD.","Sitompul SI, Pikir BS, Aryati, Kencono Wungu CD, Supandi SK, Sinta ME",Genes (Basel),2023 May 12,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
29950477,"Characteristics and the average 30-day and 6-month clinical outcomes of patients hospitalised with coronary artery disease in a poor South-East Asian setting: the first cohort from Makassar Cardiac Center, Indonesia.","OBJECTIVE: To provide a detailed description of characteristics at hospital admission and clinical outcomes at 30-day and 6-month follow-up in patients hospitalised with coronary artery disease (CAD) in a poor South-East Asian setting. DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study. SETTING: From February 2013 to December 2014, in Makassar Cardiac Center, Indonesia. PARTICIPANTS: 477 patients with CAD (acute coronary syndrome and stable CAD). OUTCOME MEASURES: All-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). RESULTS: Out of 477 patients with CAD, the proportion of young age (<60 years) was 53.9% and 72.7% were male. At admission, 44.2% of patients were diagnosed with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), 38.6% with diagnosis or signs of heart failure and 75.1% had previous hypertension. Out of 211 patients with STEMI, only 4.7% had been treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and 6.2% received thrombolysis. The time lapse from symptom onset to hospital admission was 26.8 (IQR 10.0-48.0) hours, and 19.1% of all patients had undergone either PCI or coronary artery bypass graft. The survival rate at 6 months was 78.9%. The rates of all-cause mortality at 30 days and 6 months were 13.4% and 7.3%, respectively; the rate of composite MACE at 30 days was 26.2% and 18.0% at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CAD from a poor South-East Asian setting present themselves with predominantly unstable conditions of premature CAD. These patients show relatively severe illness, have significant time delay from symptom onset to admission or intervention, and most do not receive the guidelines-recommended treatment. Awareness of symptoms, prompt initial management of acute CVD, well-established infrastructures and resources both in primary and secondary hospital for CVD should be improved to reduce the high rates of 30-day and 6-month mortality and adverse outcomes in this population.","Qanitha A, Uiterwaal CSPM, Henriques JPS, Alkatiri AH, Mappangara I, Mappahya AA, Patellongi I, de Mol BAJM",BMJ Open,2018 Jun 27,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia

This review aims to identify the literature systematically that analyzes the barriers that affect the participation of CHD patients after reperfusion therapy in implementing the CR program. This study used the Preferred Reporting Item for PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) with databases PubMed, ScienceDirect, EBSCO-hosted Academic Search Complete, Scopus, Taylor & Francis, and Sage Journals. The keywords used in English were ""coronary artery disease OR myocardial infarction OR cardiovascular disease OR heart disease"" AND ""Barrier OR obstacle"", AND ""percutaneous coronary intervention OR PCI OR angioplasty OR coronary artery bypass graft surgery OR CABG"" AND ""cardiac rehabilitation OR rehabilitation OR recovery"". The inclusion criteria in this review were full-text articles in English, articles with a descriptive, cross-sectional, and cohort design with a minimum of 100 participants that discussed barriers to participation in patients with CHD after undergoing reperfusion therapy, and the CR phases such as I, II, III, and IV have also been identified. Based on the initial search, there are 23 relevant studies out of 7400. The results of this study reported that most of the participants from the studies analyzed had a low level of participation in CR (</=50%). We classify the factors that affect the level of CR participation into five categories: individual factors, health history, environmental, logistical, and health system. The most reported barriers in each category were age, comorbidities, lack of support from friends, family and health workers, distance or travel time, and cost and economic status. Professional health workers, especially nurses, can identify various barriers that patients feel so that they can increase their participation in attending CR.","Sugiharto F, Nuraeni A, Trisyani Y, Melati Putri A, Aghnia Armansyah N",Vasc Health Risk Manag,2023,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia

Stem cell therapy to repair and regenerate the infarcted myocardium is a promising approach to address this unmet medical need. However, the poor survival of transplanted cells in the hostile ischemic myocardium has been a major hurdle in achieving an effective cell therapy against myocardial infarction. As such, novel strategies to promote the survival of transplanted cells are highly sought after. Mitochondria are intimately involved in cell survival and have been the main organelles being targeted for cytoprotection. Mitochondrial morphology is linked to mitochondrial function and cell viability. Therefore, quantitative methodologies to obtain reliable and reproducible results of mitochondrial morphology and function are essential for identifying and developing new cytoprotective strategies to enhance the survival of stem cells post-transplantation. Here, we describe methods for assessing mitochondrial morphology, mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production.","Rosdah AA, Delbridge LMD, Lim SY",Methods Mol Biol,2019,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia

This study aimed to assess whether physician characteristics may account for such reduced sex difference. (2) Methods: Totally 10,105 type 2 diabetes patients (including 4962 men and 5143 women) were selected from Taiwan's National Health Insurance claim data. The three-year period following the first day of clinical visit for type 2 diabetes in 2000 was set as the baseline period. The follow-up was made from the first day after baseline period to date of ischemic heart disease (IHD) incidence or censoring. Cox regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of IHD in relation to physician's characteristics. (3) Results: The incidence of IHD for men and women was estimated at 17.47 and 15.96 per 1000 person-years, respectively. After controlling for socio-demographic variables and co-morbidity, male patients experienced a significantly higher HR than females for IHD (1.16, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.04 to 1.29). Further adjustment for treatment adherence/continuity and physician characteristics resulted in essentially the same results. (4) Conclusions: Our study provides little support for the notation that physician characteristics may contribute to the reduced sex difference in IHD incidence in patients with type 2 diabetes.","Lee YH, Chang YH, Ku LE, Wu JS, Isfandiari MA, Chou LP, Li CY",Healthcare (Basel),2021 Apr 8,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia

RESULTS: Ten randomized controlled trials and 3 animal studies investigated resveratrol's impact on inflammatory mediators and endothelial function. In primary prevention studies, meta-analysis showed a significant reduction (95% CI: -0.73 to -0.20; P=0.0005) in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) expression with resveratrol, demonstrating a dose-dependent relationship. No significant difference was observed in interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression with P=0.58 for primary prevention and P=0.57 for secondary prevention. Vascular endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression was significantly increased after resveratrol pre-treatment following CAD events. Secondary prevention studies yielded no significant results; however, meta-regression identified associations between age, hypertension, and lower doses with the extent of TNF-alpha alterations. High certainty of evidence supported TNF-alpha reduction, while evidence for IL-6 reduction and eNOS elevation was deemed low. CONCLUSION: Resveratrol reduces TNF-alpha in individuals at risk for CAD, specifically 15 mg per day. However, its usefulness in patients with confirmed CAD is limited due to factors such as age, high blood pressure, and insufficient dosage. Due to the small sample size, the reduction of IL-6 is inconclusive. Animal studies suggest that resveratrol enhances endothelial function by increasing eNOS.

36634997,Comparison of various calcium antagonist on vasospastic angina: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Coronary artery vasospasm is an abnormal spasm of coronary arteries that cause transient or complete occlusion without exertion. It causes stable angina to ACS. However, this can be prevented by calcium channel blockers (CCBs) which suppress Ca(2+) influx into the vascular muscle cells. Nevertheless, several CCBs adverse effects are harmful for these patients. Selecting the right CCBs would give the best clinical practice. METHOD: The studies were obtained from four major medical databases by various keywords. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were implemented as adult >18 years, observational study, English language and drug of interest. Duplicates were eliminated, and the remaining studies were reviewed. Final full-texts assessment was conducted independently by Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Revised Cochrane. RESULTS: The search found 1378 articles. However, six studies were selected after implementing the study criteria. Diltiazem was found to decrease angina and increase quality of life until 12th week of treatment; however, some adverse effects include atrioventricular block and recurrent angina up till 4th week were found. Meanwhile, nifedipine was found to decrease vasospastic angina (VSA) by the fourth and eighth weeks of treatment. Nevertheless, it caused excessive drop in BP and increase heart rate by eighth week. In addition, slow-release preparation of both CCBs were found to increase efficacy and compliance. Lastly amlodipine was also found to decrease VSA by 17%+/-140% and 33% after 6 weeks, but further studies needed. CONCLUSION: Diltiazem, nifedipine and amlodipine are potent in decreasing VSA, however, tailoring specific CCBs adverse reactions to patient condition and the drug preparation would be substantially beneficial for the outcome.","Singh J, Elton A, Kwa M",Open Heart,2023 Jan,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
37249745,Exploring the link between cardiovascular risk factors and manifestations in latent tuberculosis infection: a comprehensive literature review.,"BACKGROUND: The global burden of tuberculosis (TB) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is overt, and the prevalence of this double burden disease remains steadily rising, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. This review aims to explore the association between latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and the development of cardiovascular diseases and risk factors. Furthermore, we elucidated the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that contribute to this relationship. MAIN BODY: Approximately 25% of the global population carries a dormant form of tuberculosis (TB) infection. During this latent stage, certain subsets of mycobacteria actively reproduce, and recent research suggests that latent TB infection (LTBI) is connected to persistent, long-term low-grade inflammation that can potentially contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The presence of LTBI can be confirmed through a positive result on either a tuberculin skin test (TST) or an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). Several plausible explanations for the association between LTBI and CVD include increased inflammation, autoimmunity related to heat shock proteins (HSP), and the presence of pathogens within the developing atherosclerotic plaque. The most commonly observed cardiovascular events and risk factors associated with LTBI are acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery stenosis, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: This article highlights the critical role of LTBI in perpetuating the tuberculosis disease cycle and its association with cardiovascular risk factors. Chronic and persistent low inflammation underlined the association. Identifying high-risk LTBI patients and providing targeted preventive medication are crucial strategies for global TB eradication and interrupting transmission chains.","Djaharuddin I, Amir M, Qanitha A",Egypt Heart J,2023 May 30,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
37457562,Association between cardiovascular diseases and COVID-19 pneumonia outcome in Indonesia: a multi-center cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a pandemic affecting 185 countries, including Indonesia. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in COVID-19 patients were linked to worse clinical outcomes. However, the association remained inconclusive due to limited data in Indonesia. This study aimed to determine the association between CVD in COVID-19 pneumonia patients with its clinical outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in four Indonesian hospitals, enrolling 584 adult COVID-19 pneumonia patients from September 2020 to July 2021. Patients were categorized into two groups: non-CVD and CVD [hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic heart failure (CHF), hypertensive heart disease (HHD), arrhythmia, cardiomegaly, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), mitral regurgitation (MR), and myocardial injury (MI)]. Clinical outcomes include in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit admission, ventilator use, earlier death, and prolonged hospital stay. Mann-Whitney test was used for analysis. RESULTS: The most common CVD was hypertension (48.1%), followed by MI (10.6%), CAD (9.2%), CHF (6.8%), HHD (3.1%), arrhythmia (1.7%), and others (0.7%). The in-hospital mortality rate was 24%, and patients were hospitalized for a median of 12 days. MI was the only CVD that increased in-hospital mortality (RR 2.105). It was also significantly increased in patients with diabetes mellitus (RR 1.475) and chronic kidney disease (RR 2.079). Meanwhile, prolonged hospital stay was associated with any CVD (RR 1.553), hypertension (RR 1.511), MI (RR 1.969), CHF (RR 1.595), diabetes mellitus (RR 1.359), and cerebrovascular disease (RR 2.203). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with CVD, specifically MI and hypertension, worsens the COVID-19 clinical outcomes.","Burhan E, Mubarak F, Adilah SASU, Sari CYI, Ismail E, Astuti P, Hanifah Y, Wiyarta E, Suryana NM",Front Med (Lausanne),2023,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
39801189,"Overweight, obesity, and cardiovascular disease in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia: the EAS FH Studies Collaboration registry.","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Overweight and obesity are modifiable risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in the general population, but their prevalence in individuals with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HeFH) and whether they confer additional risk of ASCVD independent of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) remains unclear. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis was conducted in 35 540 patients with HeFH across 50 countries, in the EAS FH Studies Collaboration registry. Prevalence of World Health Organization-defined body mass index categories was investigated in adults (n = 29 265) and children/adolescents (n = 6275); and their association with prevalent ASCVD. RESULTS: Globally, 52% of adults and 27% of children with HeFH were overweight or obese, with the highest prevalence noted in Northern Africa/Western Asia. A higher overweight/obesity prevalence was found in non-high-income vs. high-income countries. Median age at familial hypercholesterolaemia diagnosis in adults with obesity was 9 years older than in normal weight adults. Obesity was associated with a more atherogenic lipid profile independent of lipid-lowering medication. Prevalence of coronary artery disease increased progressively across body mass index categories in both children and adults. Compared with normal weight, obesity was associated with higher odds of coronary artery disease in children (odds ratio 9.28, 95% confidence interval 1.77-48.77, adjusted for age, sex, lipids, and lipid-lowering medication) and coronary artery disease and stroke in adults (odds ratio 2.35, 95% confidence interval 2.10-2.63 and odds ratio 1.65, 95% confidence interval 1.27-2.14, respectively), but less consistently with peripheral artery disease. Adjusting for diabetes, hypertension and smoking modestly attenuated the associations. CONCLUSIONS: Overweight and obesity are common in patients with HeFH and contribute to ASCVD risk from childhood, independent of LDL-C and lipid-lowering medication. Sustained body weight management is needed to reduce the risk of ASCVD in HeFH.","Elshorbagy A, Vallejo-Vaz AJ, Barkas F, Lyons ARM, Stevens CAT, Dharmayat KI, Catapano AL, Freiberger T, Hovingh GK, Mata P, Raal FJ, Santos RD, Soran H, Watts GF, Abifadel M, Aguilar-Salinas CA, Alhabib KF, Alkhnifsawi M, Almahmeed W, Alnouri F, Alonso R, Al-Rasadi K, Al-Sarraf A, Arca M, Ashavaid TF, Averna M, Banach M, Becker M, Binder CJ, Bourbon M, Brunham LR, Chlebus K, Corral P, Cruz D, Davletov K, Descamps OS, Dwiputra B, Ezhov M, Groselj U, Harada-Shiba M, Holven KB, Humphries SE, Kayikcioglu M, Khovidhunkit W, Lalic K, Latkovskis G, Laufs U, Liberopoulos E, Lima-Martinez MM, Maher V, Marais AD, Marz W, Mirrakhimov E, Miserez AR, Mitchenko O, Nawawi H, Nordestgaard BG, Panayiotou AG, Paragh G, Petrulioniene Z, Pojskic B, Postadzhiyan A, Reda A, Reiner Z, Reyes X, Sadiq F, Sadoh WE, Schunkert H, Shek AB, Stroes E, Su TC, Subramaniam T, Susekov AV, Tilney M, Tomlinson B, Truong TH, Tselepis AD, Tybjaerg-Hansen A, Vazquez-Cardenas A, Viigimaa M, Vohnout B, Yamashita S, Ray KK",Eur Heart J,2025 Mar 24,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
37218918,Risk Factors and Clinical Characteristics of Acute Kidney Injury in Patients with COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with a worse prognosis in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Identification of AKI, particularly in COVID-19 patients, is important for improving patients' management. The study aims to assess risk factors and comorbidities of AKI in COVID-19 patients. We systematically searched PubMed and DOAJ databases for relevant studies involving confirmed COVID-19 patients with data on risk factors and comorbidities of AKI. The risk factors and comorbidities were compared between AKI and non-AKI patients. A total of 30 studies involving 22385 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included.

36093338,Electronic Cigarette and Atherosclerosis: A Comprehensive Literature Review of Latest Evidences.,"Coronary artery diseases (CAD), also known as coronary heart disease (CHD), are the world's leading cause of death. The basis of coronary artery disease is the narrowing of the heart coronary artery lumen due to atherosclerosis. The use of electronic cigarettes has increased significantly over the years. However, harmful effects of electronic cigarettes are still not firm. The aim of this article is to review the impact of electronic cigarette and its role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis from recent studies. The results showed that several chemical compounds, such as nicotine, propylene glycol, particulate matters, heavy metals, and flavorings, in electronic cigarette induce atherosclerosis with each molecular mechanism that lead to atherosclerosis progression by formation of ROS, endothelial dysfunction, and inflammation. Further research is still needed to determine the exact mechanism and provide more clinical evidence.","Damay VA, Setiawan, Lesmana R, Akbar MR, Lukito AA, Tarawan VM, Martha JW, Nugroho J",Int J Vasc Med,2022,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
30050317,Expert opinion on the applicability of dyslipidemia guidelines in Asia and the Middle East.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a growing burden across the world. In Asia and the Middle East, in particular, CVD is among the most prevalent and debilitating diseases. Dyslipidemia is an important factor in the development of atherosclerosis and associated cardiovascular events, and so effective management strategies are critical to reducing overall cardiovascular risk. Multiple dyslipidemia guidelines have been developed by international bodies such as the European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, which all have similarities in practice recommendations for the optimal management of dyslipidemia. However, they differ in certain aspects including pharmacological treatment, lifestyle modification and the target levels used for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The evidence behind these guidelines is generally based on data from Western populations, and their applicability to people in Asia and the Middle East is largely untested. As a result, practitioners within Asia and the Middle East continue to rely on international evidence despite population differences in lipid phenotypes and CVD risk factors. An expert panel was convened to review the international guidelines commonly used in Asia and the Middle East and determine their applicability to clinical practice in the region, with specific recommendations, or considerations, provided where current guideline recommendations differ from local practice. Herein, we describe the heterogeneous approaches and application of current guidelines used to manage dyslipidemia in Asia and the Middle East. We provide consensus management recommendations to cover different patient scenarios, including primary prevention, elderly, chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes, documented CVD, acute coronary syndromes and family history of ischemic heart disease. Moreover, we advocate for countries within the Asian and Middle East regions to continue to develop guidelines that are appropriate for the local population.","Alshamiri M, Ghanaim MMA, Barter P, Chang KC, Li JJ, Matawaran BJ, Santoso A, Shaheen S, Suastika K, Thongtang N, Yusof AK",Int J Gen Med,2018,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
22354465,Apixaban: an oral direct factor-xa inhibitor.,"Apixaban is a highly selective, reversible, direct factor Xa inhibitor that inhibits both free factor Xa and prothrombinase activity, and clot-bound factor Xa activity. A predictable pharmacokinetic profile, multiple pathways of elimination, an improved bleeding profile relative to warfarin with a lack of other significant adverse events, and no need for routine anticoagulation monitoring make apixaban appealing. Apixaban is currently approved for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in total hip replacement and total knee replacement in Europe, Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand, and has been pre-approved in Indonesia and the Philippines. Completed phase 3 trials suggest that apixaban has promise as an alternative to aspirin and warfarin for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation. Results of a large phase 3 trial were the first to show a survival benefit for this new class of oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation. In patients with acute coronary syndrome, apixaban added to dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel resulted in unacceptably high rates of major bleeding. In medically ill patients, an extended course of thromboprophylaxis with apixaban was not superior to a shorter course with enoxaparin, and was associated with significantly more major bleeding events than enoxaparin. Ongoing phase 3 trials will provide data regarding the efficacy and safety of apixaban for treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.","Jimenez D, Yusen RD, Ramacciotti E",Adv Ther,2012 Mar,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
26586393,Extended Dual Antiplatelet for Diabetic Elderly Patients After Drug-eluting Stent Implantation: an Evidence-based Clinical Review.,"Antiplatelet is an important drug for patients with coronary heart disease undergoing drug-eluting stent implantation. Current guidelines recommend dual antiplatelet with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor for at least 12 months. Continuation of DAPT beyond 12 months may be considered for preventing very late stent thrombosis. Several patient-related factors that contribute to stent thrombosis have been recognized, including diabetes and advanced age, but the optimal DAPT duration for these patients is still controversial. This article reviews the efficacy of extended (>12 months) compared to standard (12 months) DAPT for reducing myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis rates, especially in diabetic elderly patients. Literature screening was conducted at PubMed and Cochrane database using ""dual antiplatelet"", ""duration"", ""adult-onset diabetes mellitus"", ""elderly"" and, ""drug-eluting stent"" as keywords. Article types were limited to meta-analysis, systematic review, randomized clinical trial, or clinical trial that compared the efficacy of extended to standard duration of DAPT. Clinical outcomes used were myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis. The initial search was done to find relevant studies specifically assessing diabetic and elderly patients, then widened to diabetic and non-diabetic patients of any age above eighteen years. A total of 5 clinical trials and 1 meta-analysis were reviewed, showing an overall risk reduction of stent thrombosis and myocardial infarction. This review has several limitations, such as its potential selection bias and under-represented proportion of diabetic and elderly patients. High-risk subgroups like diabetes mellitus has a tendency of increased ischemic risk, while advanced age could have both increased ischemic risk and bleeding risk. This review suggests that it is better to reserve extended dual antiplatelet therapy for patients with high ischemic risk and low bleeding risk (tailored therapy).","Suwita BM, Laksmi PW, Wijaya IP",Acta Med Indones,2015 Jul,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
19752490,Indication for percutaneous coronary angioplasty.,"Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or balloon angioplasty, was performed in the United States, but the technique remained challenged by the primary problem of ''re-stenosis'', which was approximately 30% closing of the coronary artery after balloon dilatation. When first PTCA introduced by Gruentzig in 1977, it was specific directed for patients who have angina, documented ischemia, single vessel disease, and proximal lesion (simple lesion). But then by the recent advanced in technology including guide wire, balloon, intravascular ultrasound, pharmacological therapy particularly of stents, it is than indicated in much more complex lesions. The extension of indication of PCI to more complex lesion were supported by many studies and clinical trials. Comprehensively indication of PCI were summarize in the two most well known guideline, following first to European Society of Cardiology (ESC, 2005) and second to the American Heart Association (AHA, 2007), American college of cardiology (ACC), and American Society of Cardiac Intervention (ASCAI). The latest guidelines for appropriateness criteria for coronary Revascularization was just published in Jan 2009 by The American College of Cardiology, Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Intervention and Society of Thoracic surgery. In this guidelines indication of coronary revascularization is assessed following 3 categories which is appropriate, uncertain and inappropriate.

31699954,Aspirin vs. P2Y12 Inhibitor Rivalry: Which One Can be Continued During Gastrointestinal Bleeding.,"Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is the mainstay of secondary prevention treatment for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and ischemic stroke, especially after coronary intervention. DAPT consists of aspirin and P2Y12 receptor inhibitor (e.g. clopidogrel), and the use of DAPT has been increased over time. The most serious and common adverse effect is gastrointestinal bleeding. Guidelines in managing such condition are available among Gastroenterologist Societies and Cardiologist Societies. Most guidelines are consistent with each other to continue the use of aspirin while withholding P2Y12. However, European Society of Cardiologist (ESC) guideline in 2017 recommends P2Y12 receptor inhibitor as the preferred antiplatelet for patient with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. This review will look on the guidelines and other supporting evidence for the justification on the antiplatelet of choice.","Bestari MB, Joewono IR",Acta Med Indones,2019 Jul,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
38324147,The 30 Years of Shifting in The Indonesian Cardiovascular Burden-Analysis of The Global Burden of Disease Study.,"IMPORTANCE: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of mortality and morbidity. Compared with disease burden rates in 1990, significant reductions in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) burden rates for CVD have been recorded. However, general DALYs rates have not changed in Indonesia in the past 30 years. Thus, assessing Indonesian CVD burdens will be an essential first step in determining primary disease interventions. OBJECTIVE: To determine the national and province-level burden of CVD from 1990 to 2019 in Indonesia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective observational study was conducted using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019, provided by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), to analyze trends in the burden of CVD, including mortality, morbidity, and prevalence characteristics of 12 underlying CVDs. EXPOSURES: Residence in Indonesia. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mortality, incidence, prevalence, death, and DALYs of CVD. RESULTS: CVD deaths have doubled from 278 million in 1990 to 651 million in 2019. All CVDs recorded increased death rates, except for rheumatic heart disease (RHD) (- 69%) and congenital heart disease (CHD) (- 37%). Based on underlying diseases, stroke and ischemic heart disease (IHD) are still the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in Indonesia, whereas stroke and peripheral artery disease (PAD) are the most prevalent CVDs. Indonesia has the second worst CVD DALYs rates compared to ASEAN countries after Laos. At provincial levels, the highest CVD DALY rates were recorded in Bangka Belitung, South Kalimantan, and Yogyakarta. In terms of DALYs rate changes, they were recorded in West Nusa Tenggara (24%), South Kalimantan (18%), and Central Java (11%). Regarding sex, only RHD, and PAD burdens were dominated by females. CONCLUSIONS: CVD mortality, morbidity, and prevalence rates increased in Indonesia from 1990 to 2019, especially for stroke and ischemic heart disease. The burden is exceptionally high, even when compared to other Southeast Asian countries and the global downward trend. GBD has many limitations. However, these data could provide policymakers with a broad view of CVD conditions in Indonesia.","Muharram FR, Multazam CECZ, Mustofa A, Socha W, Andrianto, Martini S, Aminde L, Yi-Li C",J Epidemiol Glob Health,2024 Mar,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
29447739,Native T1 and ECV of Noninfarcted Myocardium and Outcome in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the major cause of cardiac morbidity and mortality worldwide, despite the advances in treatment with coronary revascularization and modern antiremodeling therapy. Risk stratification in CAD patients is primarily based on left ventricular volumes, ejection fraction (LVEF), risk scores, and the presence and extent of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). The prognostic role of T1 mapping in noninfarcted myocardium in CAD patients has not yet been determined. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to examine prognostic significance of native T1 mapping of noninfarcted myocardium in patients with CAD. METHODS: A prospective, observational, multicenter longitudinal study of consecutive patients undergoing routine cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with T1 mapping and LGE. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Major adverse cardiocerebrovascular events (MACCE) (cardiac mortality, nonfatal acute coronary syndrome, stroke, and appropriate device discharge) are also reported. RESULTS: A total of 34 deaths and 71 MACCE (n = 665, males n = 424, median age [interquartile range] 57 [22] years; 64%; median follow-up period of 17 [11] months) were observed. Native T1 and extracellular volume were univariate predictors of outcome. Native T1 and LGE were stronger predictors of survival and MACCE compared with extracellular volume, LVEF, cardiac volumes, and clinical scores (p < 0.001). Native T1 of noninfarcted myocardium was the sole independent predictor of all-cause mortality (chi-square = 21.7; p < 0.001), which was accentuated in the absence of LGE or LVEF </=35%. For MACCE, native T1 and LGE extent were joint independent predictors (chi-square = 25.6; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Characterization of noninfarcted myocardium by native T1 is an important predictor of outcome in CAD patients, over and above the traditional risk stratifiers. The current study's results provide a basis for a novel risk stratification model in CAD based on a complementary assessment of noninfarcted myocardium and post-infarction scar, by native T1 mapping and LGE, respectively.","Puntmann VO, Carr-White G, Jabbour A, Yu CY, Gebker R, Kelle S, Rolf A, Zitzmann S, Peker E, D'Angelo T, Pathan F, Elen, Valbuena S, Hinojar R, Arendt C, Narula J, Herrmann E, Zeiher AM, Nagel E",J Am Coll Cardiol,2018 Feb 20,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
19258681,Prevention and management of coronary artery disease in patients with diabetes mellitus.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common medical problem and a major risk factor for the development of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD). Coronary artery disease is highly prevalent and is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Patients with CAD and prediabetic states should undergo lifestyle modifications aimed at preventing DM. In patients with CAD and DM, routine use of aspirin and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I)-unless contraindicated or not tolerated-and strict glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid control are strongly recommended. Intense insulin therapy might be needed for glycemic control, and high-dose statin therapy might be needed for lipid control. For blood pressure control, ACE-Is and angiotensin receptor blockers are considered as first-line therapy. The outcomes after revascularization in diabetic patients are usually worse compared with non-diabetic patients. Advances in PCI include the use of drug-eluting stents and adjunctive drug therapies, such as abciximab. Glycemic control is an important determinant of outcome after revascularization in diabetic patients. Improvements in PCI and coronary artery bypass graft surgery are leading to better results in diabetic patients, and clinical trials are presently comparing contemporary PCI with surgery.",Majid A,Acta Med Indones,2009 Jan,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
11710361,Cardiovascular epidemiology in the Asia-Pacific region.,"By 2020, non-communicable diseases including cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are expected to account for seven out of every 10 deaths in the developing countries compared with less than half this value today. As a proportion of total deaths from all-causes, CVD in the Asia Pacific region ranges from less than 20% in countries such as Thailand, Philippines and Indonesia to 20-30% in urban China, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea and Malaysia. Countries such as New Zealand, Australia and Singapore have relatively high rates that exceed 30-35%. The latter countries also rank high for coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality rate (more than 150 deaths per 100,000). In contrast, death from cerebrovascular disease is higher among East Asian countries including Japan, China and Taiwan (more than 100 per 100,000). It is worth noting that a number of countries in the region with high proportions of deaths from CVD have undergone marked declining rates in recent decades. For example, in Australia, between 1986 and 1996, mortality from CHD in men and women aged 30-69 years declined by 46 and 51%, respectively. In Japan. stroke mortality dropped from a high level of 150 per 100,000 during the 1920s-1940s to the present level of approximately 100 per 100,000. Nonetheless, CVD mortality rate is reportedly on the rise in several countries in the region, including urban China, Malaysia, Korea and Taiwan. In China, CVD mortality increased as a proportion of total deaths from 12.8% in 1957 to 35.8% in 1990. The region is undergoing a rapid pace of urbanization, industrialization and major technological and lifestyle changes. Thus, monitoring the impact of these changes on cardiovascular risks is essential to enable the implementation of appropriate strategies towards countering the rise of CVD mortality.",Khor GL,Asia Pac J Clin Nutr,2001,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
35232953,"Retrospective Study of the Association Between Platelet-to-Lymphocyte Ratio in Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome on Admission to a Rural Referral Center in East Java, Indonesia, and the Incidence of New Symptomatic Heart Failure at 6 Months.","BACKGROUND This was a retrospective study conducted at a rural referral center in East Java, Indonesia, to evaluate the association between the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) on hospital admission and the incidence of new symptomatic heart failure (HF) within 6 months in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). MATERIAL AND METHODS The study population consisted of all ACS patients who were hospitalized between 1 January and 31 December 2018 at a non-percutaneous coronary intervention-capable secondary referral hospital and came for a routine follow-up until 6 months afterwards. The diagnosis of new symptomatic HF was based on International Classification of Diseases 10th revision code I50.9. RESULTS From 126 hospitalized patients, 92 patients were included in the analysis. The incidence rate of new symptomatic HF at 6 months was 70.65%. High PLR upon initial admission was significantly associated with new symptomatic HF incidence (odds ratio=1.70, P<0.001). PLR was also able to discriminate new symptomatic HF incidence at 6 months with area under the curve of 0.83 (P=0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that PLR was an independent predictor for new symptomatic HF incidence (hazard ratio=4.5, P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS In a rural center in Indonesia, the PLR was independently correlated with the onset of new symptomatic HF in patients with ACS 6 months after hospital admission. The PLR may be a supplementary biomarker for clinical outcomes in patients with ACS for use in resource-limited regions.","Intan RE, Alkaff FF, Oktaviono YH, Nugraha RA, Octora TN, Jonatan M, Balti DR, Hasibuan FS, Radi B, Santoso A",Med Sci Monit,2022 Mar 2,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
35429418,PCSK9 and LRP6: potential combination targets to prevent and reduce atherosclerosis.,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a disease characterized by atherosclerosis formation which causes sudden cardiac death. The prevalence of CAD is expected to increase by 2030. Atherosclerosis started from accumulation of LDL in the blood vessels, followed by endothelial cell activation and dysfunction. PCSK9 is a gene that plays an important role in the creation of atherosclerotic plaque through induced degradation of LDLRs. Inhibition of PCSK9 gene resulted in a decrease of LDLRs degradation and reduction in LDL-C levels. LRP6, as well as its mutation, is a coreceptor that contributes to atherosclerosis through the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. By employing EMPs mediated miRNA-126, third-generation antisense against miR-494-3p (3 GA-494), and recombinant Wnt mouse Wnt3a (rmWnt3a), the inhibition of LRP6 could reduce VSMCs proliferation, enhancing anti-inflammatory macrophages, and diminished bioactive lipids component, respectively. Those mechanisms lead to the stabilization and reduction of atherosclerosis plaques.","Desita SR, Hariftyani AS, Jannah AR, Setyobudi AK, Oktaviono YH",J Basic Clin Physiol Pharmacol,2022 Sep 1,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
27433345,Mitochondrial fission - a drug target for cytoprotection or cytodestruction?,"Mitochondria are morphologically dynamic organelles constantly undergoing processes of fission and fusion that maintain integrity and bioenergetics of the organelle: these processes are vital for cell survival. Disruption in the balance of mitochondrial fusion and fission is thought to play a role in several pathological conditions including ischemic heart disease. Proteins involved in regulating the processes of mitochondrial fusion and fission are therefore potential targets for pharmacological therapies. Mdivi-1 is a small molecule inhibitor of the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1. Inhibiting mitochondrial fission with Mdivi-1 has proven cytoprotective benefits in several cell types involved in a wide array of cardiovascular injury models. On the other hand, Mdivi-1 can also exert antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects, particularly in hyperproliferative cells. In this review, we discuss these divergent effects of Mdivi-1 on cell survival, as well as the potential and limitations of Mdivi-1 as a therapeutic agent.","Rosdah AA, K Holien J, Delbridge LM, Dusting GJ, Lim SY",Pharmacol Res Perspect,2016 Jun,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
38523733,Resistance Training in Cardiovascular Diseases: A Review on Its Effectiveness in Controlling Risk Factors.,"Cardiovascular Disease (CVD), a term encompassing various disorders affecting the heart and blood vessels, includes coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD is primarily due to the development of atherosclerotic plaques that disrupt blood flow, oxygenation, and nutrient delivery to the myocardium. Risk factors contributing to CAD progression include smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), dyslipidaemia, and obesity. While aerobic exercise (AE) has shown promising results in controlling CVD risk factors, the impact of resistance training (RT) has not been extensively investigated. This review aims to describe the effects of RT on CVD risk factors based on studies retrieved from PubMed and Google Scholar databases. Both isometric and isotonic RT have been found to decrease systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure, or mean arterial pressure, with SBP showing a more significant reduction. Hypertensive patients engaging in RT alongside a calorie-restricted diet demonstrated significant improvements in blood pressure. RT is associated with increased nitric oxide bioavailability, sympathetic modulation, and enhanced endothelial function. In type-2 DM patients, 8-12 weeks of RT led to improvements in fasting blood glucose levels, insulin secretion, metabolic syndrome risk, and glucose transporter numbers. Combining AE with RT had a more significant impact in reducing insulin resistance and enhancing blood glucose compared to performing exercises separately. It also significantly decreased total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein levels while increasing high-density lipoprotein within 12 weeks of application. However, improvements are considered insignificant when lipid levels are already low to normal at baseline. The administration of RT resulted in weight loss and improved body mass index, with more pronounced effects seen when combining AE with RT and a calorie-restricted diet. Considering these results, the administration of RT, either alone or in combination with AE, proves beneficial in rehabilitating CAD patients by improving various risk factors.","Nazir A, Heryaman H, Juli C, Ugusman A, Martha JW, Moeliono MA, Atik N",Integr Blood Press Control,2024,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
37738916,Prognostic identifier of cerebrovascular complications in tuberculous meningitis: Meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Cerebrovascular complications could occur in 15-57 % of patients with tuberculous meningitis (TBM). It is crucial to rapidly identify TBM patients who are at risk for stroke. This study aimed to find predictors of stroke in patients with TBM. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis were done using literature searches through online databases up to April 30th, 2022. Three independent authors performed literature screening, data extraction, and critical appraisal of the studies. Eight studies involving 1535 samples were included. RESULTS: We analyzed data regarding demographic, comorbidity, clinical presentation, radiologic, and laboratory parameters. Overall, clinical presentation that showed outcome difference was found in patients with findings of vomiting (OR = 2.71, 95 % CI: 1.30-5.63), cranial nerve deficit (OR = 4.10, 95 % CI: 1.83-9.21), focal deficit (OR = 5.56, 95 % CI: 2.24-13.79), and altered consciousness (OR = 1.90, 95 % CI: 1.24-2.92). Some comorbidities showed significant differences such as diabetes mellitus (OR = 2.58, 95 % CI: 1.51-4.41), hypertension (OR = 5.73, 95 % CI: 3.36-9.77), ischemic heart disease (OR = 2.18, 95 % CI: 1.02-4.63), and smoking (OR = 2.65, 95 % CI: 1.22-5.77). Two radiological changes shown to have significantly higher proportions are hydrocephalus (OR = 2.50, 95 % CI: 1.74-3.58) and meningeal enhancements (OR = 3.99, 95 % CI: 1.73-9.20). CONCLUSION: Our analysis indicated that clinical presentations of vomiting, cranial nerve deficit, focal deficit, altered consciousness; comorbidity of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking history, ischemic heart disease; and radiological findings of meningeal enhancement and hydrocephalus showed significant association with stroke incidence in tuberculous meningitis.","Tomidy J, Satriadinatha GBY, Liwang FK, Maharani K, Imran D, Estiasari R",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,2023 Nov,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
34611061,"The Importance of Selecting Permanent Pacemaker, Evaluating the Heart and Assessing Quality of Life in Cardiac Patient.","The use of pacemakers is necessary for patients with symptomatic bradycardia. Pacemaker implantation also acts as a life-saving procedure. However, there are several reports that patients with a pacemaker (the most widely used pacemaker is on the right ventricle, known as single chamber pacemaker) had disturbances in left ventricle contraction lead to left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Global Longitudinal Strain (GLS) Echocardiography can confirm these left ventricular disturbances. Echocardiography examination is best carried out before and after single-chamber PPM implantation. This study compares PPM placement in apical Right Ventricle (RV) and Right Ventricular Outflow Tract (RVOT) and compares paced QRS duration 150 ms and > 150 ms. Pacing burden >40% causes subclinical left ventricular systolic dysfunction after a month of PPM implantation with decreased GLS in apical RV pacing.This study gives additional information that PPM placement is preferably in RVOT with some specific settings. However, there are many ways to reduce the effects of impaired left ventricular function due to lead installation on the PPM single-chamber device. By using the PPM device which has a dual chamber, the leads will be placed in RVOT and also in the right atrium with atrial-ventricle synchronization. The aim is to avoid impaired left ventricular pump function as supported by a systematic review which states the superiority of dual-chamber PPM over single-chamber PPM in reducing atrial fibrillation and pacemaker syndrome. In the importance of quality of life related to heart disease, the Indonesian version of the MacNew questionnaire can be used. This questionnaire seeks the quality of life of patients with coronary heart disease after revascularization surgery and has undergone rehabilitation. Another important thing is the suitability of the adaptation to the original English version.",Wijaya IP,Acta Med Indones,2021 Jul,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
29326185,Enhancing prescribing of guideline-recommended medications for ischaemic heart diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis of interventions targeted at healthcare professionals.,"OBJECTIVES: Ischaemic heart diseases (IHDs) are a leading cause of death worldwide. Although prescribing according to guidelines improves health outcomes, it remains suboptimal. We determined whether interventions targeted at healthcare professionals are effective to enhance prescribing and health outcomes in patients with IHDs. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed and EMBASE for studies published between 1 January 2000 and 31 August 2017. We included original studies of interventions targeted at healthcare professionals to enhance prescribing guideline-recommended medications for IHDs. We only included randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Main outcomes were the proportion of eligible patients receiving guideline-recommended medications, the proportion of patients achieving target blood pressure and target low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C)/cholesterol level and mortality rate. Meta-analyses were performed using the inverse-variance method and the random effects model. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. RESULTS: We included 13 studies, 4 RCTs (1869 patients) and 9 cluster RCTs (15 224 patients). 11 out of 13 studies were performed in North America and Europe. Interventions were of organisational or professional nature. The interventions significantly enhanced prescribing of statins/lipid-lowering agents (OR 1.23; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.42, P=0.004), but not other medications (aspirin/antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers and the composite of medications). There was no significant association between the interventions and improved health outcomes (target LDL-C and mortality) except for target blood pressure (OR 1.46; 95% CI 1.11 to 1.93; P=0.008). The evidence was of moderate or high quality for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Organisational and professional interventions improved prescribing of statins/lipid-lowering agents and target blood pressure in patients with IHDs but there was little evidence of change in other outcomes.

29920124,Long-term incidence and risk factors of cardiovascular events in Asian populations: systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based cohort studies.,"BACKGROUND: Scientific studies on cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden and risk factors are predominantly based on short-term risk in Westerner populations, and such information may not be applicable to Asian populations, especially over the longer term. This review aims to estimate the long-term (>10 years) CVD burden, including coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as associated risk factors in Asian populations. METHODS: PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were systematically searched, and hits screened on: Asian adults, free of CVD at baseline; cohort study design (follow-up >10 years). Primary outcomes were fatal and non-fatal CVD events. Pooled estimates and between-study heterogeneity were calculated using random effects models, Q and I(2) statistics. RESULTS: Overall, 32 studies were eligible for inclusion (follow-up: 11-29 years). The average long-term rate of fatal CVD is 3.68 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 2.84-4.53), the long-term cumulative risk 6.35% (95% CI 4.69%-8.01%, mean 20.13 years) and the cumulative fatal stroke/CHD risk ratio 1.5:1. Important risk factors for long-term fatal CVD (RR, 95% CI) were male gender (1.49, 1.36-1.64), age over 60/65 years (7.55, 5.59-10.19) and current smoking (1.68, 1.26-2.24). High non-HDL-c, and beta- and gamma-tocopherol serum were associated only with CHD (HR 2.46 [95% CI 1.29-4.71] and 2.47 [1.10-5.61] respectively), while stage 1 and 2 hypertensions were associated only with fatal stroke (2.02 [1.19-3.44] and 2.89 [1.68-4.96] respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Over a 10 year + follow-up period Asian subjects had a higher risk of stroke than CHD. Contrary to CVD prevention in Western countries, strategies should also consider stroke instead of CHD only.","Irawati S, Wasir R, Floriaan Schmidt A, Islam A, Feenstra T, Buskens E, Wilffert B, Hak E",Curr Med Res Opin,2019 Feb,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia

Coal was key to the Industrial Revolution and along with petroleum, was essential to world development. However, coal is the most pollutant of fossil fuels, generating more CO(2) and particulate material. Coal-derived air pollution is associated with several diseases including respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lower respiratory infections, cerebrovascular disease, ischaemic heart disease and lung cancer. Air pollution caused by coal and other fossil fuels causes millions of deaths a year. Despite its negative impacts on human health and climate change, coal has been extensively used for electricity generation in the last four decades and is still responsible for more than 35% of all the electricity produced in the world, with countries like Australia, Indonesia, Poland, India and China showing a much higher coal dependency from 45% to 75% in 2023.

34815751,2021 Asian Pacific Society of Cardiology Consensus Recommendations on the Use of P2Y1(2) Receptor Antagonists in the Asia-Pacific Region: Special Populations.,"Advanced age, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease not only increase the risk for ischaemic events in chronic coronary syndromes (CCS) but also confer a high bleeding risk during antiplatelet therapy. These special populations may warrant modification of therapy, especially among Asians, who have displayed characteristics that are clinically distinct from Western patients. Previous guidance has been provided regarding the classification of high-risk CCS and the use of newer-generation P2Y(12) inhibitors (i.e. ticagrelor and prasugrel) after acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in Asia. The authors summarise evidence on the use of these P2Y(12) inhibitors during the transition from ACS to CCS and among special populations. Specifically, they present recommendations on the roles of standard dual antiplatelet therapy, shortened dual antiplatelet therapy and single antiplatelet therapy among patients with coronary artery disease, who are either transitioning from ACS to CCS; elderly; or with chronic kidney disease, diabetes, multivessel coronary artery disease and bleeding events during therapy.","Tan JWC, Chew DP, Tsui KL, Tan D, Duplyakov D, Hammoudeh A, Zhang B, Li Y, Xu K, Ong PJ, Firman D, Gamra H, Almahmeed W, Dalal J, Tam LW, Steg G, Nguyen QN, Ako J, Al Suwaidi J, Chan M, Sobhy M, Shehab A, Buddhari W, Wang Z, Fong AYY, Karadag B, Kim BK, Baber U, Chin CT, Han YL",Eur Cardiol,2021 Feb,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia

We aim to estimate the extent of preventable deaths due to tobacco and SHS exposure in Southeast Asia. METHODS: Data were from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. We analysed data from Southeast Asia, including Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, Mauritius, Myanmar, Philippines, Seychelles, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam. RESULTS: In 2019, there were 728,500 deaths attributable to tobacco in Southeast Asia, with 128,200 deaths attributed to SHS exposure. The leading causes of preventable deaths were ischemic heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, lower respiratory infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer. Among deaths attributable to tobacco, females had higher proportions of deaths attributable to SHS exposure than males in Southeast Asia. CONCLUSION: The burden of preventable deaths in a year due to SHS exposure in Southeast Asia is substantial. The implementation and enforcement of smoke-free policies should be prioritized to reduce the disease burden attributed to passive smoking in Southeast Asia.","Leung J, Lim C, Sun T, Vu G, McClure-Thomas C, Bao Y, Tran L, Santo T, Fausiah F, Farassania G, Chan GCK, Sebayang SK",Int J Public Health,2024,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
36170801,The role of optimism in manifesting recovery outcomes after coronary artery bypass graft surgery: A systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE: Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) is a major surgery conducted in coronary heart disease management. Postoperative recovery is a crucial process for patients undergoing CABG. This systematic review evaluates current evidence regarding the association between trait optimism and recovery outcomes in patients following coronary artery bypass graft surgery. METHODS: This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) 2020 Guideline. The inclusion criteria focused on observational study that examined study participants aged >/=18 years old undergoing elective CABG and measurement of trait optimism with validated methods (i.e. LOT, LOT-R) and at least one recovery outcome. Studies in non-English languages and duplicates were excluded. A systematic literature search was carried out on PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science electronic databases. Search results were screened based on the eligibility criteria. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the quality of each included study. RESULTS: The search yielded a total of 1853 articles, in which 7 articles fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were subsequently included in the analysis. Measurement of trait optimism was conducted on 1276 patients who underwent a non-emergency/elective CABG. Optimism was significantly associated with several categories of recovery, including reduced rehospitalization rate, complications, pain, and physical symptoms along with improved quality of life, rate of return to normal life, and psychological status. CONCLUSION: Our review showed that trait optimism was associated with recovery outcomes following CABG surgery. However, the heterogeneity of recovery outcomes may hamper the clinical benefit of trait optimism in CABG.

38599562,3D printing technology and its revolutionary role in stent implementation in cardiovascular disease.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD), exemplified by coronary artery disease (CAD), is a global health concern, escalating in prevalence and burden. The etiology of CAD is intricate, involving different risk factors. CVD remains a significant cause of mortality, driving the need for innovative interventions like percutaneous coronary intervention and vascular stents. These stents aim to minimize restenosis, thrombosis, and neointimal hyperplasia while providing mechanical support. Notably, the challenges of achieving ideal stent characteristics persist. An emerging avenue to address this involves enhancing the mechanical performance of polymeric bioresorbable stents using additive manufacturing techniques And Three-dimensional (3D) printing, encompassing various manufacturing technologies, has transcended its initial concept to become a tangible reality in the medical field. The technology's evolution presents a significant opportunity for pharmaceutical and medical industries, enabling the creation of targeted drugs and swift production of medical implants. It revolutionizes medical procedures, transforming the strategies of doctors and surgeons. Patient-specific 3D-printed anatomical models are now pivotal in precision medicine and personalized treatment approaches. Despite its ongoing development, additive manufacturing in healthcare is already integrated into various medical applications, offering substantial benefits to a sector under pressure for performance and cost reduction. In this review primarily emphasizes stent technology, different types of stents, highlighting its application with some potential complications. Here we also address their benefits, potential issues, effectiveness, indications, and contraindications. In future it can potentially reduce complications and help in improving patients' outcomes. 3DP technology offers the promise to customize solutions for complex CVD conditions and help or fostering a new era of precision medicine in cardiology.","Khan MA, Khan N, Ullah M, Hamayun S, Makhmudov NI, Mbbs R, Safdar M, Bibi A, Wahab A, Naeem M, Hasan N",Curr Probl Cardiol,2024 Jun,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
37445467,Intramyocardial Stem Cell Transplantation during Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery Safely Improves Cardiac Function: Meta-Analysis of 20 Randomized Clinical Trials.,"IMSC transplantation during CABG is considered one of the most promising methods to effectively deliver stem cells and has been widely studied in many trials. But the results of outcomes and safety of this modality still vary widely. We conducted this meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate not only the outcome but also the safety of this promising method. A meta-analysis was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive literature search was undertaken using the PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases. Articles were thoroughly evaluated and analyzed. Twenty publications about IMSC during CABG were included. Primary outcomes were measured using LVEF, LVESV, LVESVI, LVESD, LVEDV, LVEDVI, LVEDD, WMSI, and 6-MWT. Safety measures were depicted by total deaths, MACE, CRD, CVA, myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmia, and cardiac-related readmission. IMSC transplantation during CABG significantly improved LVEF (MD = 3.89%; 95% CI = 1.31% to 6.46%; p = 0.003) and WMSI (MD = 0.28; 95% CI = 0.01-0.56; p = 0.04). Most of the other outcomes showed favorable results for the IMSC group but were not statistically significant. The safety analysis also showed no significant risk difference for IMSC transplantation compared to CABG alone. IMSC during CABG can safely improve cardiac function and tend to improve cardiac volumes and dimensions. The analysis and application of influencing factors that increase patients' responses to IMSC transplantation are important to achieve long-term improvement.","Soetisna TW, Thamrin AMH, Permadijana D, Ramadhani ANE, Sugisman, Santoso A, Mansyur M",J Clin Med,2023 Jun 30,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia

37252407,Clinicodemographic Profile and Outcomes of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in the Indonesian Cohort of DISCOVER: A 3-Year Prospective Cohort Study.,"BACKGROUND: Indonesia is amongst the top 10 countries with the highest prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) at 10.8%. However, the distinguishable features of T2DM in Indonesia remain obscure. Therefore, the DISCOVER study aimed to describe the characteristics of T2DM patients, associated vascular complications and treatment in Indonesia. METHODOLOGY: DISCOVER study is a multi-country, multicenter, prospective, cohort study over 3 years. In the present study, the data were collected from 13 sites from clinical practice, hospitals and public health facilities in Indonesia. RESULTS: A total of 221 subjects were recruited with a mean age of 55.6 +/- 9.8 years and body mass index (BMI) of 26.4 +/- 4.4 kg/m(2). Over 40% of patients had hypertension and/or hyperlipidemia. The mean duration of T2DM was 58.3 +/- 62.0 months while the mean HbA1c levels was 9.2 +/- 2%. In total, 82.4% completed the study within a 36-month followup period. BMI remained elevated i.e., >25 kg/m(2). A significant reduction was observed in HbA1c levels as compared to baseline (9.2 +/- 2% to 8.1 +/- 1.8%). T2DM-associated microvascular complications such as peripheral neuropathy, albuminuria and chronic kidney disease were observed in 17.2%. Macrovascular complications including coronary artery disease and heart failure were seen in 26.2% of patients. We also found that more than 70% of patients were on metformin and/or sulfonylurea. CONCLUSION: The features of patients with T2DM in Indonesia were high BMI, with hypertension and hyperlipidemia as co-morbidities. Metformin and sulfonylureas were the most common treatment. HbA1c reduction during follow-up did not reach recommended target. Thus, early detection and intervention using available glucose-lowering medications and aggressive management of risk factors and complications are essential to improve outcomes of diabetes management in Indonesia.","Soeatmadji DW, Rosandi R, Saraswati MR, Sibarani RP, Tarigan WO",J ASEAN Fed Endocr Soc,2023,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia

31981452,Antiaggregation effect of clopidogrel in coronary heart disease patients using omeprazole.,"Background Antiplatelet agents used in coronary heart disease (CHD) cause gastrointestinal side effects. Omeprazole can prevent and cure these antiplatelet side effects. Clopidogrel combined with aspirin increases the risk of gastrointestinal tract ulcers and bleeding. This research studied the effect of omeprazole on the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel. Methods CHD patients using clopidogrel and aspirin receive omeprazole 20 mg in a single dose for 10 days. Platelet antiaggregation point for clopidogrel was measured using VerifyNow P2Y12. The cutoff points used were: low on treatment platelet reactivity (LPR) <85 P2Y12 reaction unit (PRU), normal on treatment platelet reactivity (NPR) 85-208 PRU, and high on treatment platelet reactivity (HPR) >208 PRU. Results Using the paired t-test PRU points pre- and post-omeprazole were 154 +/- 85.89 PRU and 169.4 +/- 56.15 PRU, respectively. The PRU points were consistent or decreased from the previous PRU points below the HPR cutoff (p: 0.215; >0.05). Before omeprazole use, five patients were categorized as NPR, two patients as LPR, and three patients as HPR. After omeprazole use, two patients, each from HPR and NPR category had a PRU point >208; the rest showed results below the HPR point. Conclusions In this study the PRU points of clopidogrel after omeprazole use showed a PRU <208. The hypothesis that omeprazole may reduce the antiaggregation effect of clopidogrel as shown by the increase in PRU above the cutoff points >208 PRU (HPR) was not proven.","Munthe DHB, Sargo SS, Yogiarto M",J Basic Clin Physiol Pharmacol,2020 Jan 25,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
32089874,Increased Heart Rate Variability following Elective Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Patients with Stable Coronary Artery Disease and Preprocedural Anxiety.,"BACKGROUND: There is a strong association between chronic ischemia and autonomic imbalance. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may restore autonomic balance in patients with stable coronary artery disease (SCAD), which is characterized by increased heart rate variability (HRV). Anxiety is often found in patients who are going to undergo invasive procedures and has been identified to induce autonomic imbalance. The aim of our study is to identify the impact of preprocedural anxiety on increased HRV following an elective PCI. METHODS: Our study was a pretest and post-test correlation study involving 44 SCAD patients who underwent elective PCI at Cipto Mangunkusumo National Hospital. The HRV was measured before and after PCI. Anxiety symptoms were evaluated using Hospital Anxiety Depression Score (HADS) questionnaires. RESULTS: We found a higher increase on HRV parameter following the PCI of subjects in the nonanxiety group compared with the anxiety group (median = 9.11 vs. 2.83; U = 154.00; p=0.043). CONCLUSIONS: Preprocedural anxiety may inhibit HRV increase following PCI procedure.","Oktaramdani T, Mudjaddid E, Muhadi, Shatri H",Cardiol Res Pract,2019,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia

Single cells isolated from an excess heart tissue obtained from the correction of the right ventricular hypertrophy in patients with Tetralogy of Fallot for future heart study were investigated. METHODS: Once resected, the heart tissues were transported at 37  degrees C, in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium/ DMEM (4.5 g.L(-1), antibiotic-antimycotic 3x, PRP10% (v/v)), to reach the lab within 30 min, weighted and grouped into less than 500 mg and more than 1000 mg (n = 4). Each sample was digested with 250 U.mL(-1) Collagenase type V and 4U.mL(-1) Proteinase XXIV in the MACS C-tube (Milltenyi, Germany), then dissociated using the MACS Octo Dissociator with Heater (Milltenyi, Germany) for 60 min at 37  degrees C. RESULTS: All cells isolated were rod-shaped cells; viability was up to 90%. The cell density obtained from the 500 mg group were 4,867 +/- 899 cells.mg(-1) tissue weight, significantly higher compared to the 1,000 mg group; had 557 +/- 490 cells.mg(-1) tissue weight (mean of (n = 3) +/- 95% C.l).

CONCLUSION: Cardiomyocytes taken from the wasted heart tissue might be a candidate of cardiomyocytes source to study interventions to the heart as it contained up to 13.38% cardiomyocytes, and 32.25% of cardiac progenitor cells. Moreover, perhaps when cardiac cell therapy needs autologous cardiomyocytes, less than 500 mg tissue weight can be considered as sufficient.","Sandora N, Putra MA, Nurhayati RW, Suwarti, Nauli R, Kusuma TR, Fitria NA, Ardiansyah, Muttaqin C, Makdinata W, Alwi I",Cell Tissue Bank,2022 Sep,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
37304338,Factors Associated with Increased Length of Stay in Post Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Patients: A Scoping Review.,"Several studies identify factors affecting increased length of stay (LOS) in patients with post-primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, there has not been a review study that synthesizes these results. This study aimed to describe the duration of LOS and factors associated with increased LOS among patients with STEMI after PPCI. This study used scoping review using EBSCO-host Academic Search Complete, PubMed, Scopus, Taylor & Francis, and Google Scholar databases. The keywords used in English were ""adults OR middle-aged"" AND ""length of stay OR hospital stay"" AND ""primary percutaneous coronary intervention OR PPCI"" AND ""myocardial infarction OR coronary infarction OR cardiovascular disease"". The inclusion criteria for articles were: the article was a full-text in English; the sample was STEMI patients who had undergone a PPCI procedure; and the article discussed the LOS. We found 13 articles discussing the duration and factors affecting LOS in patients post-PPCI. The duration of LOS was the fastest 48 hours, and the longest of LOS was 10.2 days. Factors influencing LOS are categorized into three predictors: low, moderate, and high. Post-procedure complications after PPCI was the most influential factors in increasing the LOS duration. Professional health workers, especially nurses, can identify various factors that can be modified to prevent complications and worsen disease prognosis to increase LOS efficiency.","Sugiharto F, Trisyani Y, Nuraeni A, Mirwanti R, Melati Putri A, Aghnia Armansyah N",Vasc Health Risk Manag,2023,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
37744767,Predicting multi-vascular diseases in patients with coronary artery disease.,"Background: Because of its systemic nature, the occurrence of atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries can also indicate a risk for other vascular diseases. However, screening program targeted for all patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) is highly ineffective and no studies have assessed the risk factors for developing multi-vascular diseases in general. This study constructed a predictive model and scoring system to enable targeted screening for multi-vascular diseases in CAD patients. Methods: This cross-sectional study includes patients with CAD, as diagnosed during coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention from March 2021 to December 2021. Coronary artery stenosis (CAS) and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) were diagnosed using Doppler ultrasound while peripheral artery disease (PAD) was diagnosed based on ABI score. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to construct the predictive model and risk scores. Validation was conducted using ROC analysis and Hosmer-Lemeshow test. Results: Multivariate analysis showed that ages of >60 years (OR [95% CI] = 1.579 [1.153-2.164]), diabetes mellitus (OR = 1.412 [1.036-1.924]), cerebrovascular disease (OR = 3.656 [2.326-5.747]), and CAD3VD (OR = 1.960 [1.250-3.073]) increased the odds for multi-vascular disease. The model demonstrated good predictive capability (AUC = 0.659) and was well-calibrated (Hosmer-Lemeshow p = 0.379). Targeted screening for high-risk patients reduced the number needed to screen (NNS) from 6 in the general population to 3 and has a high specificity of 96.5% Conclusions: Targeted screening using clinical risk scores was able to decrease NNS with good predictive capability and high specificity.","Adiarto S, Nurachman LA, Dewangga R, Indriani S, Taofan T, Alkatiri AA, Firman D, Santoso A",F1000Res,2023,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
33386841,Hydralazine protects the heart against acute ischaemia/reperfusion injury by inhibiting Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission.,"AIMS: Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial fission induced by acute myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) has been shown to reduce myocardial infarct size. The clinically used anti-hypertensive and heart failure medication, hydralazine, is known to have anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic effects. Here, we investigated whether hydralazine confers acute cardioprotection by inhibiting Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission. METHODS AND RESULTS: Pre-treatment with hydralazine was shown to inhibit both mitochondrial fission and mitochondrial membrane depolarisation induced by oxidative stress in HeLa cells. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), pre-treatment with hydralazine attenuated mitochondrial fission and cell death induced by oxidative stress, but this effect was absent in MEFs deficient in the mitochondrial fission protein, Drp1. Molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance studies demonstrated binding of hydralazine to the GTPase domain of the mitochondrial fission protein, Drp1 (KD 8.6+/-1.0 microM), and inhibition of Drp1 GTPase activity in a dose-dependent manner. In isolated adult murine cardiomyocytes subjected to simulated IRI, hydralazine inhibited mitochondrial fission, preserved mitochondrial fusion events, and reduced cardiomyocyte death (hydralazine 24.7+/-2.5% vs. control 34.1+/-1.5%, P=0.0012). In ex vivo perfused murine hearts subjected to acute IRI, pre-treatment with hydralazine reduced myocardial infarct size (as % left ventricle: hydralazine 29.6+/-6.5% vs. vehicle control 54.1+/-4.9%, P=0.0083), and in the murine heart subjected to in vivo IRI, the administration of hydralazine at reperfusion, decreased myocardial infarct size (as % area-at-risk: hydralazine 28.9+/-3.0% vs. vehicle control 58.2+/-3.8%, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: We show that, in addition to its antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects, hydralazine, confers acute cardioprotection by inhibiting IRI-induced mitochondrial fission, raising the possibility of repurposing hydralazine as a novel cardioprotective therapy for improving post-infarction outcomes.","Kalkhoran SB, Kriston-Vizi J, Hernandez-Resendiz S, Crespo-Avilan GE, Rosdah AA, Lees JG, Costa JRSD, Ling NXY, Holien JK, Samangouei P, Chinda K, Yap EP, Riquelme JA, Ketteler R, Yellon DM, Lim SY, Hausenloy DJ",Cardiovasc Res,2022 Jan 7,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
33667694,Prognostic performance of troponin in COVID-19: A diagnostic meta-analysis and meta-regression.,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac injury is frequently encountered in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is associated with increased risk of mortality. Elevated troponin may signify myocardial damage and is predictive of mortality. This study aimed to assess the prognostic value of troponin above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL) for mortality, and factors affecting the relationship. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus and Embase was undertaken, from inception of the databases until 16 December 2020. The key exposure was elevated serum troponin, defined as troponin (of any type) above the 99th percentile URL. The outcome was mortality due to any cause. RESULTS: In total, 12,262 patients from 13 studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The mortality rate was 23% (20-26%). Elevated troponin was observed in 31% (23-38%) of patients. Elevated troponin was associated with increased mortality [odds ratio (OR) 4.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.07-5.53; P < 0.001; I(2) = 19.9%]. Meta-regression showed that the association did not vary with age (P = 0.218), male gender (P = 0.707), hypertension (P = 0.182), diabetes (P = 0.906) or coronary artery disease (P = 0864). The association between elevated troponin and mortality had sensitivity of 0.55 (0.44-0.66), specificity of 0.80 (0.71-0.86), positive likelihood ratio of 2.7 (2.2-3.3), negative likelihood ratio of 0.56 (0.49-0.65), diagnosis odds ratio of 5 (4-5) and area under the curve of 0.73 (0.69-0.77). The probability of mortality was 45% in patients with elevated troponin and 14% in patients with non-elevated troponin. CONCLUSION: Elevated troponin was associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19 with 55% sensitivity and 80% specificity.","Wibowo A, Pranata R, Akbar MR, Purnomowati A, Martha JW",Int J Infect Dis,2021 Apr,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
26932699,ST2 Levels Before and After Treatment of NYHA III and IV Heart Failure.,"AIM: to find whether ST2 can be used to determine clinical improvement in patients with NYHA III and IV heart failure. METHODS: this is a longitudinal, pre and post-test study without a control group. Study subjects are 23 NYHA III and IV heart failure patients. ST2 was tested at the start and end of hospital treatment. RESULTS: of 23 heart failure patients, 70% were classified as NYHA III while 30% were NYHA IV. There were more male subjects than females (51.4% vs. 48.6%). Median age for NYHA III heart failure patients was 52 years and mean age for NYHA IV heart failure patients was 58 years. Heart failure was mostly caused by coronary artery disease (52%). ST2 levels did not correlate with age, length of care, sex and cause of heart failure. ST2 levels in NYHA IV heart failure patients (58.82+/-37.36 ng/mL) tended to be higher than the one in NYHA III group (30.75 [14.4-84.5] ng/mL), but the difference was statistically not insignificant (p=0.89). ST2 levels at the start of treatment was significantly higher than at the end (31.4 [14-129.2] ng/mL vs. 18.4 [7.6-77.8] ng/mL), p=0.001. This shows that clinical improvement is associated with significant reduction of ST2 levels. CONCLUSION: ST2 can be used as a marker to determine clinical improvement in NYHA III and IV heart failure.","Immanuel S, Mandey NM, Makmun LH",Acta Med Indones,2015 Oct,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
24585902,Ischemic preconditioning reduces apoptosis in open heart surgery.,"BACKGROUND: This study was performed to assess the role of ischemic preconditioning on cardiomyocyte apoptosis after open heart surgery, based on morphology by transmission electron microscopy, caspase-3 activity, biochemical markers, and cardiac performance. METHODS: 12 piglets were divided into 2 equal groups: an ischemic preconditioning group and a control group. Ventricular muscles were collected to examine apoptotic ultrastructure morphology and caspase-3 activity. Blood samples from the coronary sinus were obtained for measurement of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, malondialdehyde, and cardiac troponin I. Aortic blood samples were taken for lactate measurements before and after cardiopulmonary bypass. Cardiac performance was measured by echocardiography before and after surgery. RESULTS: Cardiomyocyte apoptosis occurred postoperatively, as shown by ultrastructure observation. Caspase-3 activity was less in the ischemic preconditioning group than the control group (p < 0.05). Measurements of specific markers of cardiomyocyte injury also showed lower increases in the ischemic preconditioning group, although not significantly different. Clinical outcomes showed that ischemic preconditioning was able to preserve cardiac performance in terms of ejection fraction, cardiac index, and stroke volume index; these were statistically significant, except for lactate concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiomyocyte apoptosis occurs after open heart surgery. Ischemic preconditioning can reduce cardiomyocyte apoptosis and improve cardiac performance. Laboratory findings showed that ischemic preconditioning prevents injury of cardiomyocytes and reduces lactate concentration, although not statistically significant.","Rachmat J, Sastroasmoro S, Suyatna FD, Soejono G",Asian Cardiovasc Thorac Ann,2014 Mar,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
24045397,Potential clinical application of novel cardiac biomarkers for acute myocardial infarction.,"Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of cardiac related death worldwide. Therefore, early and accurate diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome is required to determine the next clinical step. The current gold standard for cardiac markers, troponin and CK-MB have their downside. The delayed increase of detectable circulating level of these markers contribute to delayed diagnosis and therapy. Novel biomarkers that rise earlier, has a good diagnosis accuracy and has additional prognostic information, are highly needed. There are some potential emerging novel biomarkers for acute myocardial infarction. High sensitivity troponin have a greater sensitivity and accuracy for detection and early exclusion of myocardial infarction, as compared to troponin. B-natriuretic peptide (BNP and NT-pro BNP) provide prognostic information in regards of mortality. Myeloperoxidase identify subjects with increased risk of cardiac events in the absence of myocardial necrosis. Dual marker strategy combining copeptin with troponin T is more accurate assay to diagnose acute myocardial infarction. The level of Growth Differentiation Factor-15 is correlated with the risk of death or myocardial infarction in the next 6 months. While, Heart-Fatty Acid Binding Protein assay is an earlier marker for myocardial necrosis and provide valuable prognostic information and can further stratify patients' risk. Novel cardiac biomarkers provide a faster exclusion of acute myocardial infarction, yet with very good accuracy. However unlike their predecessors, the clinical use of these novel cardiac biomarkers are not only limited to establishing the diagnosis of myocardial infarction. Novel cardiac biomarkers possess additional potential use, some of which are to determine patients' prognosis and to further stratify patients' risk that would determine the next step of therapy.","Nursalim A, Suryaatmadja M, Panggabean M",Acta Med Indones,2013 Jul,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
39760806,Risk and Protective Factors of Poor Clinical Outcomes in Heart Failure with Improved Ejection Fraction Population: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"AIMS: Heart failure with improved ejection fraction (HFimpEF) patients could still develop adverse outcomes despite EF improvement. This study evaluates the risk and protective factors of poor clinical outcomes in HFimpEF patients. METHODS: Systematic searching was done to include studies that evaluate the risks of developing poor outcomes in HFimpEF patients. HFimpEF is defined as improvement of 5-10% EF within 6-12 months or normalization of EF > 40%. Poor clinical outcome is defined as a composite of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, HF rehospitalization, and requirement of LVAD/ transplant. Odds ratios of outcome are pooled with random effects model. A subgroup analysis of multivariate analysis-only studies was also conducted. RESULTS: 32 studies comprising 10,740 HFimpEF patients are included. Poor clinical outcomes followed up for approximately 3 years, are seen in 18.9% of HFimpEF patients. Twelve statistically significant factors that increase the risk of outcome are found. Among them, anemia (OR 7.69, CI 3.48-16.99, I(2) 0%) and baseline NT pro-BNP (OR 3.25) are the two most important predictors. Other significant risk factors are increasing age, ischemic heart disease, NYHA III/IV, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, dyslipidemia, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, use of diuretics, and baseline LVEDD. Alternately, protective factors of poor clinical outcome are regression of left atrial diameter (LAD) (OR 0.33, CI: 0.18-0.61, p 0.0003, I(2) 0%), use beta-blockers, SGLT- 2 inhibitors, and baseline LVEF level (OR 0.60, 0.78, 0.90, respectively). CONCLUSION: HFimpEF patients are not fully recovered and patient stratification based on risk and protective factors is recommended.","Huang W, Nurhafizah A, Frederich A, Khairunnisa AR, Kezia C, Fathoni MI, Samban S, Flindy S",Curr Cardiol Rep,2025 Jan 6,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
40134053,Diet and the gut microbiota profiles in individuals at risk of chronic heart failure - A review on the Asian population.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) is one of the leading cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), particularly in the Asian population. Individuals with specific health risks, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD), are more susceptible to developing CHF. Current evidence is limited to understanding the link between gut microbiota dysbiosis and CHF. Therefore, this review aims to explore the potential connection between dietary patterns, gut microbiota, and its metabolites in individuals at risk of CHF in the Asian population. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: A literature review of cross-sectional studies was conducted using primary keywords such as ""Asian"", ""obesity"", ""type 2 diabetes"", ""hypertension"", ""dyslipidemia"", ""coronary artery disease"", and ""chronic heart failure"". There was no restriction on sample size. RESULTS: Several gut microbiotas were found to correlate with CHF risk factors. There were increased levels of Prevotella, Klebsiella, Romboutsia, Catenibacterium, Clostridium, Holdemanella, Ruminococcus, Coprococcus, Parabacteroides, Bacteroides, Lachnoclostridium, Streptococcus, and Megamonas, while decreased levels of Oscillibacter, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Akkermansia, Roseburia, Faecalibacterium, Pseudobutyrivibrio, and Eubacterium were reported. These microbiota shifts were linked to increased TMAO production and impaired short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production. Dietary intake and microbial metabolites were also identified as contributors to the gut microbiota associated with CHF. CONCLUSIONS: A potential link exists between the gut microbiota profile and CHF risk factors, possibly mediated by microbial metabolites. Dietary patterns may influence CHF-associated gut microbiota and me-tabolites. Future research is needed to investigate how dietary modifications can modulate gut microbiota and its metabolites in CHF patients.","Fadhillah FS, Habibah K, Juniarto AZ, Sobirin MA, Maharani N, Pramono A",Asia Pac J Clin Nutr,2025 Apr,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
18042522,Desirable intakes of polyunsaturated fatty acids in Indonesian adults.,"A Indonesian Advisory Group on Fatty Acid Nutrition and Health was established in 2004 to consider the increasing incidence of nutritionally-related cardiovascular disease in Indonesia. Emerging international recommendations, often focused on dietary fat and may not have been relevant to the national situation. Traditional dietary patterns were apparently protective against ischaemic heart disease often with fat derived dominantly from a particular source like coconut, soy, peanut or fish. These fats were used in ways which promoted the use of potentially cardioprotective foods like legumes, vegetables, fruits and aquatic food. Optimal intakes of polyunsaturated fatty acids in Indonesia are likely to reflect both absolute intakes and the relationships between n-3 and n-6 fatty acids of longer chain lengths. This leaves some issues for active and continuing review, like the intakes of trans fatty acids, and the regulatory and food labelling implications. Some studies underway and others which need implementation will enable the Advisory Group to prepare a second report with more basis in Indonesian evidence. In the meantime, the Advisory Group has recommended that the AHA (American Heart Association) and ISSFAL (International Society for the Study of Fatty Acids and Lipids) recommendations obtain until the end of 2007.","Hanafiah A, Karyadi D, Lukito W, Muhilal, Supari F",Asia Pac J Clin Nutr,2007,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
35888580,High Level of Mid-Regional Proadrenomedullin during ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction Is an Independent Predictor of Adverse Cardiac Events within 90-Day Follow-Up.,"Background and Objectives: the cardiovascular adverse events including mortality and heart failure, persist significantly during the first months after the acute phase of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The increased level of midregional proadrenomedullin (MR-proADM), at hospital presentation in STEMI patients is considered an independent predictor of short-term and long-term mortality and heart failure. This study aimed to measure MR-proADM levels during the acute and recovery phases of STEMI and corroborate whether MR-proADM level was associated with the adverse cardiac events after recovering from STEMI. Materials and Methods: this prospective study enrolled subjects with acute phase STEMI admitted to the intensive cardiac care unit. After recovering and discharged from hospitalization, subjects were followed-up for 90 days. For MR-proADM measurement, the blood samples during acute phase were withdrawn on hospital admission (MR-proADM-0) and during recovery at the day-30 follow up (MR-proADM-30). Adverse cardiac events were evaluated at 30-day and 90-day follow up, namely a composite of death, chronic heart failure, and hospital readmission of any cardiac causes. Results: 83 subjects were enrolled. The median MR-proADM-0 was 3313.33 pg/mL and MR-proADM-30 was significantly reduced at 292.50 pg/mL, p < 0.001. Nineteen subjects (22.9%) experienced adverse cardiac events at 30-day follow up. The MR-proADM-0 level was independently associated with 30-day adverse cardiac events (adjustedOR 1.002, 95%CI: 1.001-1.003, p = 0.040), after adjustment with other variables. In this case, 25 subjects (32.5%) experienced adverse cardiac events at 90-day follow-up. The MR-proADM-0 level was independently associated with 90-day adverse cardiac events (adjustedOR 1.002, 95%CI: 1.001-1.003, p = 0.049). The higher changes of MR-proADM-0 to MR-proADM-30 also associated with adverse cardiac events at 90 days. Conclusions: The MR-proADM was significantly increased during the acute phase of STEMI and declined during recovery phase. The higher MR-proADM level during the acute phase of STEMI and its change intensity were predictors of adverse cardiac events within the 90-day follow up.","Hartopo AB, Puspitawati I, Anggraeni VY",Medicina (Kaunas),2022 Jun 28,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
25629795,The use of medications in the secondary prevention of coronary artery disease in the Asian region.,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases, to which coronary artery disease (CAD) is a significant contributor, are a leading cause of long-term morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the years ahead, it is estimated that approximately half of the world's cardiovascular burden will occur in the Asian region. Currently there is a large gap in secondary prevention, with unrealized health gains resulting from underuse of evidence-based medications, including beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), aspirin and other antiplatelet agents, and lipid-lowering drugs. Despite the almost universal recommendation for these drugs in unstable CAD, their under-prescription is well documented for patients with acute heart failure, non-obstructive CAD, and for secondary prevention of CAD. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the burden of CAD in Asian countries together with guidelines supporting evidence-based medication use from a secondary prevention perspective. METHODS: The MEDLINE database was searched from 2000 to 2013, inclusive, for country-specific data related to CAD and supplemented with unpublished registry data. RESULTS: In the post-discharge setting following hospital admission for acute coronary syndromes, medication prescription rates were low. Beta-blocker prescription rates ranged from 49% in China to 99% in Singapore, ACE-inhibitor/ARB prescription rates ranged from 28% in China to 96% in Singapore, and lipid-lowering therapy rates ranged from 47% in China to 97% in Singapore. Aspirin/antiplatelet drug prescription rates ranged from 86% in Indonesia to 99.5% in Singapore. Recommendations are provided to improve patient outcomes and reduce the disease burden in Asia. CONCLUSIONS: Despite recommendations issued in international and national guidelines, use of CAD medications in Asia remains suboptimal. In the absence of clear contraindications, all patients with unstable CAD should receive these agents as secondary prevention. This averts the need to target drug use according to risk, with high-risk features paradoxically associated with under-prescribing of such drugs.","Dalal J, Low LP, Van Phuoc D, Abdul Rahman AR, Reyes E, Ann Soenarta A, Tomlinson B",Curr Med Res Opin,2015 Mar,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
31073105,Profile of Kawasaki Disease in Adolescents: Is It Different?,"BACKGROUND: there is clearly growing population of young adults with potentially important coronary artery disease after Kawasaki disease (KD) during childhood, and cardiologist must be prepared to take care for them. As Kawasaki disease in adolescent and adult is rare and under-recognized, it is important to study data on patient presentations which may permit development of diagnostic criteria and treatment guidelines for this age group.This study aimed to compare the clinical profile of KD between adolescents (>10 years of age) and children </=10 years. METHODS: This is a cross sectional study. A total of 1150 KD cases (age 1-192 months) during the period of January 2003-December 2016 were analyzed. The clinical profile of subjects aged >10 years (adolescents) and  </=10 years (children) at acute phase of KD were compared. RESULTS: we found 17 cases of KD in adolescents among 1150 total cases (1.5%). Incomplete KD was more often seen in adolescents compared to children </= 10 years of age (59% vs. 29%). Some clinical features were more frequently seen in children than in adolescents, e.g. conjunctivitis (85% in </= 10 years of age vs. 65% in > 10 years), mucosal changes (94% vs. 77%), rash (86% vs. 59%), and hand/foot changes (68% vs. 41%). While other clinical features were more often seen in adolescents, e.g., cervical lymphadenopathy (82% vs. 39%) and coronary dilatation (47% vs. 29%). Laboratory results (hemoglobin, leukocytes, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein) did not differ much between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Kawasaki disease in adolescents has some different clinical profile from that of younger age. Majority of adolescent patients have incomplete presentation. Some clinical features such as conjunctivitis, mucosal changes, rash, and hand/foot changes are more often seen in children </= 10 years compared to in adolescents, while cervical lymphadenopathy and coronary dilatation are more frequently seen in adolescents. The ratio of male to female is much higher in adolescents.","Advani N, Santoso LA, Sastroasmoro S",Acta Med Indones,2019 Jan,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia
31912996,Remote ischemic preconditioning reduces the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy in patients undergoing coronary angiography/intervention: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"BACKGROUND: Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is associated with increased mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing coronary angiography (CAG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We aimed to assess the latest evidence on the effect of remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) on the incidence of CIN in patients undergoing CAG/PCI. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive search on topics assessing RIPC and CIN in CAG/PCI patients from inception up until July 2019 through several electronic databases. RESULTS: There were a total of 1,925 subjects from 14 randomized controlled trials. Remote ischemic preconditioning was associated with reduced CIN incidence in patients undergoing CAG/PCI (OR 0.41 [0.30, 0.55], p < .001; I(2) : 22%). The nephroprotective effect was also demonstrated in those at moderate-high risk for CIN subgroup (OR 0.41 [0.29, 0.58], p < .001; I(2) : 26%) and PCI-only subgroup (OR 0.41 [0.29, 0.58], p < .001; I(2) : 0%). Time from RIPC to CAG/PCI has similar effectiveness among </=45, </=60, and </=120 min. Mortality, rehospitalization, hemodialysis, and major adverse events were lower in the RIPC group (OR 0.50 [0.33, 0.76], p = .001; I(2) : 0%). Grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) assessment showed that RIPC has high evidence certainty for reducing CIN in patients undergoing PCI/CAG, moderate-high risk subgroup, and PCI-only subgroup with absolute reduction of 97 per 1,000, 129 per 1,000, and 121 per 1,000, respectively. Harbord test showed no evidence for the presence of small-study effects (p = .157). CONCLUSIONS: Remote ischemic preconditioning is an effective procedure to reduce the risk of CIN and should be considered in patients with moderate-high risk at developing CIN.","Pranata R, Tondas AE, Vania R, Toruan MPL, Lukito AA, Siswanto BB",Catheter Cardiovasc Interv,2020 Nov,Ischemic Heart Disease AND Indonesia

31657690,Type 2 Diabetes and its Impact on the Immune System.,"INTRODUCTION: Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is a major health problem worldwide. This metabolic disease is indicated by high blood glucose levels due to insufficient insulin production by the pancreas. An inflammatory response occurs as a result of the immune response to high blood glucose levels as well as the presence of inflammatory mediators produced by adipocytes and macrophages in fat tissue. This low and chronic inflammation damages the pancreatic beta cells and leads to insufficient insulin production, which results in hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia in diabetes is thought to cause dysfunction of the immune response, which fails to control the spread of invading pathogens in diabetic subjects. Therefore, diabetic subjects are known to more susceptible to infections. The increased prevalence of T2D will increase the incidence of infectious diseases and related comorbidities. OBJECTIVE: This review provides an overview of the immunological aspect of T2D and the possible mechanisms that result in increased infections in diabetics. CONCLUSION: A better understanding of how immune dysfunctions occur during hyperglycemia can lead to novel treatments and preventions for infectious diseases and T2D comorbidities, thus improving the outcome of infectious disease treatment in T2D patients.","Berbudi A, Rahmadika N, Tjahjadi AI, Ruslami R",Curr Diabetes Rev,2020,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
36309772,Sarcopenia and Chronic Complications of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Sarcopenia, defined as the loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength and/or a decrease in physical performance, is classically related to aging. However, chronic disease, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), may accelerate the development of sarcopenia. Previous studies found strong association between T2DM and sarcopenia. Insulin resistance that exists in T2DM is thought to be the key mediator for impaired physical function and mobility which may lead to sarcopenia. T2DM may cause sarcopenia through the mediation of insulin resistance, inflammation, accumulation of advanced glycation end-products, and oxidative stress that may affect muscle mass and strength, protein metabolism, and vascular and mitochondrial dysfunction. On the other hand, loss of muscle in sarcopenia may play a role in the development of T2DM through the decreased production of myokines that play a role in glucose and fat metabolism. This review highlights the findings of existing literature on the relationship between T2DM and sarcopenia which emphasize the pathophysiology, chronic vascular complications, and the course of macrovascular and microvascular complications in T2DM.","Purnamasari D, Tetrasiwi EN, Kartiko GJ, Astrella C, Husam K, Laksmi PW",Rev Diabet Stud,2022 Sep 28,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
37491159,Global prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease, with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as a major predictor. Insulin resistance and chronic inflammation are key pathways in the pathogenesis of T2DM leading to NAFLD and vice versa, with the synergistic effect of NAFLD and T2DM increasing morbidity and mortality risks. This meta-analysis aims to quantify the prevalence of NAFLD and the prevalence of clinically significant and advanced fibrosis in people with T2DM. METHODS: MEDLINE and Embase databases were searched from inception until 13 February 2023. The primary outcomes were the prevalence of NAFLD, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis in people with T2DM. A generalised linear mixed model with Clopper-Pearson intervals was used for the analysis of proportions with sensitivity analysis conducted to explore heterogeneity between studies. RESULTS: 156 studies met the inclusion criteria, and a pooled analysis of 1 832 125 patients determined that the prevalence rates of NAFLD and NASH in T2DM were 65.04% (95% CI 61.79% to 68.15%, I(2)=99.90%) and 31.55% (95% CI 17.12% to 50.70%, I(2)=97.70%), respectively. 35.54% (95% CI 19.56% to 55.56%, I(2)=100.00%) of individuals with T2DM with NAFLD had clinically significant fibrosis (F2-F4), while 14.95% (95% CI 11.03% to 19.95%, I(2)=99.00%) had advanced fibrosis (F3-F4). CONCLUSION: This study determined a high prevalence of NAFLD, NASH and fibrosis in people with T2DM. Increased efforts are required to prevent T2DM to combat the rising burden of NAFLD.

36240684,The efficacy of vitamin B(12) supplementation for treating vitamin B(12) deficiency and peripheral neuropathy in metformin-treated type 2 diabetes mellitus patients: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Metformin-treated type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients are at higher risk of vitamin B(12) deficiency and more severe neuropathy symptoms. There is still no guideline suggesting vitamin B(12) supplementation for this population. This study aimed to analyze the efficacy of vitamin B(12) supplementation in this population. METHOD: Studies reporting the efficacy of vitamin B(12) supplementation in metformin-treated T2DM patients were systematically searched in PubMed, Cochrane, EBSCOHost, and Scopus following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. Additional relevant studies were searched manually through citations. Study quality and risk of bias were assessed using suitable tools. RESULTS: Seven clinical trials with a total of 506 participants were included. Using the Cochrane's Risk of Bias 2 tools for clinical trials, 4 studies were assessed to have high risk of bias and 3 studies had low risk of bias. There were 5 studies that measured changes in serum vitamin B(12) level, all of which reported a statistically significant increase after supplementation. Significant reductions in homocysteine after supplementation were found in 2 studies. Its effect on neuropathy symptoms was still unclear, with 2 studies reporting a significant improvement and 1 study reporting no significant effect. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this systematic review support the implementation of vitamin B(12) supplementation for metformin-treated T2DM to prevent or treat vitamin B(12) deficiency and neuropathy. More high-quality clinical studies are required to generate quantitative analysis and to encourage supplementation in available guidelines.","Pratama S, Lauren BC, Wisnu W",Diabetes Metab Syndr,2022 Oct,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
33511948,The Prospect for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Combined with Exercise and Synbiotics: A Perspective.,"Change in gut microbiome diversity (the so-called dysbiosis) is correlated with insulin resistance conditions. Exercise is typically the first management for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which is generally well-known for improving glucose regulation. The new prebiotics and probiotics, like synbiotics, designed to target specific diseases, require additional studies. While the effectiveness of exercise combined with synbiotics seems promising, this review discusses these agents' possibility of increasing the gut microbiota's diversity. Therefore, they could enhance short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). In particular, the synbiotic interaction on gut microbiota, the exercise mechanism in improving gut microbiota, and the prospect of the synergistic effect of the combination of synbiotic and exercise to improve insulin sensitivity are addressed.","Dewi L, Rosidi A, Noer ER, Ayuningtyas A",Curr Diabetes Rev,2021,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
36714242,In Vitro Insulin Resistance Model: A Recent Update.,"Insulin resistance, which affects insulin-sensitive tissues, including adipose tissues, skeletal muscle, and the liver, is the central pathophysiological mechanism underlying type 2 diabetes progression. Decreased glucose uptake in insulin-sensitive tissues disrupts insulin signaling pathways, particularly the PI3K/Akt pathway. An in vitro model is appropriate for studying the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying insulin resistance because it is easy to maintain and the results can be easily reproduced. The application of cell-based models for exploring the pathogenesis of diabetes and insulin resistance as well as for developing drugs for these conditions is well known. However, a comprehensive review of in vitro insulin resistance models is lacking. Therefore, this review was conducted to provide a comprehensive overview and summary of the latest in vitro insulin resistance models, particularly 3T3-L1 (preadipocyte), C2C12 (skeletal muscle), and HepG2 (liver) cell lines induced with palmitic acid, high glucose, or chronic exposure to insulin.","Yudhani RD, Sari Y, Nugrahaningsih DAA, Sholikhah EN, Rochmanti M, Purba AKR, Khotimah H, Nugrahenny D, Mustofa M",J Obes,2023,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
35124077,Relation Between Glycemic Control and Cardiac Autonomic Neuropathy in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus Type 2.,"BACKGROUND: Glycemic control is very important in type 2 diabetic patients. Microangiopathy is the first chronic complications in type 2 diabetic patients. Cardiac autonomic neuropathy can be used as a tool for early detection of complication in type 2 diabetic that relates well with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to analyze the correlation between glycemic control and cardiac autonomic neuropathy in type 2 diabetic patients. METHODS: It was an observational cross sectional with correlative analysis conducted on type 2 diabetic at Hasan Sadikin hospital within July until August 2019. Value of HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, and post prandial plasma glucose within 2 years were obtained with NGSP standard of examination. Cardiac autonomic neuropathy was assessed by Cardiovascular Autonomic Reflex Testing's (CARTs) with Bellevere scoring system. RESULT: The research was conducted on 39 subjects with mean age 56 +/- 7,05 years (48,7% males and 51,3% women). Median value of the last HbA1c was 7,6% (5,2%-12,9%) and mean HbA1c in the last 2 years was 8,1 +/- 1,88%. Median CARTs score was 5 (1-8). Rank-Spearman correlation analysis showed significant moderately positive correlation between HbA1c and CARTs score (r = 0,454, CI 95% 0,187-0,772, P = 0,004) and also mean HbA1c within the last 2 years with CARTs score (r = 0,564, IK 95% 0,289-0,839, P = 0,000). Multivariate analysis, mean HbA1c remained correlated significantly with CARTs score even after adjustment toward age, gender, duration of diabetes, and diabetic therapy. CONCLUSION: There is significant moderately positive correlation between glycemic control and cardiac autonomic neuropathy in type 2 diabetic patients.","Achmad C, Lim NS, Pramudyo M, Iqbal M, Karwiky G, Febrianora M, Natalia N",Curr Probl Cardiol,2023 Jul,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
39445433,Once-weekly insulin icodec as novel treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials.,"AIMS: The primary objective of this investigation is to examine the efficacy and safety of insulin icodec when compared to regular basal insulin for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted on the Cochrane Library, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Medline databases up until August 19th, 2023. This review incorporates literature that examines the comparison between insulin icodec and basal insulin. The risk of bias was assessed by using RoB v2 tool from Cochrane Collaborations. We employed random-effect models to analyze the mean difference (MD) and odds ratio (OR) for presentation of the outcomes. RESULTS: A total of nine trials with 3,963 participants were incorporated. Five included trials had ""low-risk"" of bias, whereas the remaining four trials had ""some-concern"" risk of bias due to protocol deviations from intended intervention. The results of our meta-analysis showed no significant difference in the reduction of HbA1c levels between insulin icodec and regular basal insulin (MD -0.11 %; 95 %CI: -0.23, 0.01, p = 0.08, I(2) = 91 %). The fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and body weight change from baseline also did not differ significantly between two groups. Meanwhile, the total adverse events (TAEs) were shown to be higher in the insulin icodec; however, the serious AEs (SAEs) and clinically significant hypoglycemia did not differ significantly between insulin icodec and these active controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests similar efficacy and safety between insulin icodec and regular basal insulin. Further clinical trials are still needed to confirm the results of our study.

37563662,The experiences and barriers in addressing type 2 diabetes mellitus-associated erectile dysfunction: a mixed method systematic review.,"INTRODUCTION: Experiences and determinants connected with type 2 diabetes mellitus-associated erectile dysfunction (T2DMED) in health appointments are not well understood and infrequently reported. This systematic review was undertaken to synthesise evidence of the experiences, facilitators, and barriers around screening ED in men with T2DM during health service consultations. METHODS: The review report was based on the guidelines provided by the Joanna Briggs Institute for conducting mixed-method systematic reviews. Eight electronic databases were searched, including Web of Science, Embase via Ovid, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) via EBSCO, ProQuest, PubMed, PsychInfo via Ovid, MEDLINE via Ovid, Portal Garuda. Additionally, the review manually looked through the reference lists of the studies we included. Erectile dysfunction, type 2 diabetes mellitus, screening and barriers were initially used as keywords in the search strategy. All identified primary studies written in English and Bahasa Indonesia, and published between 2001 and 2022 were meticulously screened following an agreed set of inclusion criteria. FINDINGS: Out of 3468 papers screened, only six were chosen for the review. These included three cross-sectional studies, two qualitative studies, and one mixed-method study. The study quality of the included studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist. Based on the checklist criteria, the studies ranged between 5/10 to 9/10 in terms of quality. After synthesizing the findings, four main categories were identified including the willingness to discuss T2DMED, the barriers experienced and perceived, the limited understanding of T2DMED, and the support expected by men with T2DM. DISCUSSION: Many men kept quiet about their struggles with T2DMED, hoping to bring it up as a topic of discussion during healthcare consultations. Barriers such as embarrassment, a sense of helplessness and reluctance to seek help, financial constraints, and dismissive healthcare professionals hindered them from addressing this issue. Both the participating men and healthcare professionals lacked a comprehensive understanding of T2DMED. RECOMMENDATIONS: It is important to provide education tailored to men's specific needs and improve awareness about T2DM-associated ED. Creating a more T2DMED-friendly environment could be a potential solution to increase early screening and management. Future research should investigate potential barriers that prevent HCPs from identifying and addressing T2MED since their absence in the identified studies highlights this need.

34839111,Direct Medical Cost of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Its Associated Complications in Indonesia.,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the direct medical cost of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its complications in the Indonesian population from a payer perspective using a prevalence-based approach. METHODS: The direct medical costs in 2016 were estimated using the database of Indonesia's National Health Insurance, known as Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional, which included diagnosis-related group costs and unbundled costs for patients accessing advanced care. The study population included people aged 30 years or older having a diagnosis of T2DM. T2DM and its related complications were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, code. Hypoglycemia and all complications listed in the Diabetes Severity Complications Index were included. Descriptive analysis was conducted. Costs were converted to 2016 US dollar equivalent. RESULTS: Of the 18.9 million Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional members who accessed secondary and tertiary care, 812 204 (4%) were identified with T2DM, of which 57% had complications. The most common complication was cardiovascular diseases (24%). The total direct medical cost was US $576 million, with 56% spent on hospitalization, 38% on specialist visits, 4% on unbundled non-diabetes-related medication, and 2% on unbundled anti-hyperglycemic medications. Approximately 74% of the total costs was used for the management of people with complications. People with complications (US $930/person/year +/- US $1480/person/year) incurred twice the cost of those without complications (US $421/person/year +/- US $745/person/year). CONCLUSION: The direct medical cost for management of people with T2DM in Indonesia was high. Early diagnosis and optimal management of T2DM to prevent complications may reduce the costly sequelae and have a possibility of cost savings.","Hidayat B, Ramadani RV, Rudijanto A, Soewondo P, Suastika K, Siu Ng JY",Value Health Reg Issues,2022 Mar,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia

Yoga could be one type of exercise to overcome the barriers to adhere to regular physical activity. The current study aimed to systematically review the effect of yoga on health-related fitness, including cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, body composition, balance, and flexibility, among patients with T2DM. METHODS: We systematically searched four databases and two registries (Pubmed, Scopus, Cochrane, Embase, WHO-ITCRP, and Clinicaltrials.gov) in September 2021, following a registered protocol on PROSPERO (CRD42022276225). Study inclusion criteria were T2DM patients with or without complication, yoga intervention as a single component or as a complement compared to other kinds of exercise or an inactive control, health-related fitness, and a randomized, controlled trial or quasi-experimental with control group design. The ROBINS-I tool and ROB 2.0 tool were used to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. A vote-counting analysis and meta-analysis computed using random effects' models were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 10 records from 3 quasi-experimental and 7 randomized, controlled trials with 815 participants in total were included. The meta-analysis favored yoga groups compared to inactive controls in improving muscle strength by 3.42 (95% confidence interval 2.42 to 4.43), repetitions of chair stand test, and improving cardiorespiratory fitness by 6.6% (95% confidence interval 0.4 to 12.8) improvement of baseline forced vital capacity. The quality of evidence for both outcomes was low. CONCLUSION: Low-quality evidence favored yoga in improving health-related fitness, particularly muscle strength and cardiorespiratory fitness, among patients with T2DM.

36612560,Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Telecoaching for Self-Care Management among Persons with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"BACKGROUND: In response to the need for safe care for people with diabetes mellitus in the current outbreak of COVID-19, it is critical to evaluate the model, service delivery, feasibility, and efficiency of diabetes mellitus telecoaching. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the model and efficacy of telecoaching to improve self-care and clinical outcomes. METHODS: This study uses the Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). We searched on 22 March 2022, using keywords that matched the MeSH browser in four databases to find relevant studies, namely, PubMed/Medline, Proquest, Scopus, and EBSCOhost. Additionally, we collected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on Google Scholar using the snowball technique. A quality assessment was performed using the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias tool (RoB)2. The meta-analysis used the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model to analyze the pooled mean difference (MD) and its p-value. RESULTS: Thirteen RCT studies were included for the systematic review and meta-analysis with a total number of participants of 3300. The model of telecoaching is a form of using nurses-led telephone and mobile apps, which are relatively cost-effective. The meta-analysis showed a positively improved statistically significance in clinical outcomes, including in HbA1c (a pooled MD of -0.33; 95% CI: -0.51--0.15; p = 0.0003), blood glucose (-18.99; 95% CI: -20.89--17.09; p = 0.00001), systolic blood pressure (-2.66; 95% CI: -3.66--1.66; p = 0.00001), body mass index (-0.79; 95% CI: -1.39--0.18; p = 0.01), and weight (-2.16 kg; 95% CI: -3.95--0.38; p = 0.02). It was not, however, statistically significant in diastolic blood pressure (-0.87; 95% CI: -2.02-0.28; p = 0.14), total cholesterol (-0.07; 95% CI: -0.26-0.12; p = 0.46), low-density lipoprotein (-2.19; 95% CI: -6.70-2.31; p = 0.34), triglycerides (-13.56; 95% CI: -40.46-13.35; p = 0.32) and high-density protein (0.40; 95% CI: -1.12-1.91; p = 0.61). CONCLUSIONS: The telecoaching with nurses-led telephone and mobile apps significantly affected clinical outcomes on HbA1c, systolic blood pressure, weight, and BMI. Moreover, there was no significant effect on the total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein. Thus, telecoaching has the potential as a care model in diabetes mellitus during COVID-19 and similar pandemics to improve self-care and clinical outcomes, but all the studies analyzed involved non-COVID-19 patients, limiting the generalizability of the results to COVID-19.","Platini H, Lathifah A, Maulana S, Musthofa F, Amirah S, Abdurrahman MF, Komariah M, Pahria T, Ibrahim K, Lele JAJMN",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2022 Dec 23,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
35742719,Medication Knowledge and Adherence in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients in Brunei Darussalam: A Pioneer Study in Brunei Darussalam.,"AIM: The present study measured the medication knowledge and medication adherence in patients with type 2 diabetes in Brunei Darussalam. Demographic details and diabetes knowledge were also evaluated. METHODS: A cross-sectional study conducted via the administration of a structured questionnaire consisting of 4 sections via a face-to-face interview. RESULTS: A total of 118 participants were interviewed. A majority of the participants were aged 40 years or above (106, 89.8%). The mean number of total medications that the participants were taking was 7.36 +/- 2.87 and the mean number of antidiabetic medications was 2.39 +/- 1.06. As for the antidiabetic therapy, the largest proportion of the participants were taking oral antidiabetic medications only (87, 73.73%). In the diabetes knowledge section of the questionnaire, more than half of the participants (63, 53.34%) scored higher than the acquired mean score. Family history, education level, and total medications taken were significantly correlated with diabetes knowledge. However, in the medication knowledge section of the questionnaire, the mean score (3.37 +/- 1.38) was below the intended score for good knowledge. Medication knowledge has been significantly associated with gender, family history and total medications taken. A majority of the participants reported non-adherence (74, 62.71%) due to various reasons. In this study, those of the Malay race were significantly correlated with adherence to their medication regimen. This study also revealed that there is no significant relationship between diabetes knowledge, medication knowledge and medication adherence. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides insights in regard to patients with type 2 diabetes in Brunei Darussalam and their knowledge towards the disease as well as their medications. Despite the lack of significance between the variables, the rate of non-adherence is still alarming. Further studies are required to better understand the barriers to non-adherence in these patients.","Muhammad Haskani NH, Goh HP, Wee DVT, Hermansyah A, Goh KW, Ming LC",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2022 Jun 18,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia

37606429,"Review of the Case Reports on Metformin, Sulfonylurea, and Thiazolidinedione Therapies in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients.","Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the world's most common metabolic disease. The development of T2DM is mainly caused by a combination of two factors: the failure of insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta-cells and the inability of insulin-sensitive tissues to respond to insulin (insulin resistance); therefore, the disease is indicated by a chronic increase in blood glucose. T2DM patients can be treated with mono- or combined therapy using oral antidiabetic drugs and insulin-replaced agents; however, the medication often leads to various discomforts, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation, nausea and vomiting, and hypersensitivity reactions. A biguanide drug, metformin, has been used as a first-line drug to reduce blood sugar levels. Sulfonylureas work by blocking the ATP-sensitive potassium channel, directly inducing the release of insulin from pancreatic beta-cells and thus decreasing blood glucose concentrations. However, the risk of the failure of sulfonylurea as a monotherapy agent is greater than that of metformin or rosiglitazone (a thiazolidinedione drug). Sulfonylureas are used as the first-line drug of choice for DM patients who cannot tolerate metformin therapy. Other antidiabetic drugs, thiazolidinediones, work by activating the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), decreasing the IR level, and increasing the response of beta-cells towards the glucose level. However, thiazolidines may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, weight gain, water retention, and edema. This review article aims to discuss case reports on the use of metformin, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones in DM patients. The literature search was conducted on the PubMed database using the keywords 'metformin OR sulfonylureas OR thiazolidinediones AND case reports', filtered to 'free full text', 'case reports', and '10 years publication date'. In some patients, metformin may affect sleep quality and, in rare cases, leads to the occurrence of lactate acidosis; thus, patients taking this drug should be monitored for their kidney status, plasma pH, and plasma metformin level. Sulfonylureas and TZDs may cause a higher risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain or edema due to fluid retention. TZDs may be associated with risks of cardiovascular events in patients with concomitant T2DM and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Therefore, patients taking these drugs should be closely monitored for adverse effects.","Susilawati E, Levita J, Susilawati Y, Sumiwi SA",Med Sci (Basel),2023 Aug 15,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between low social support and risk for depression in people with type 2 diabetes through a meta-analysis. METHODS: PubMed, ProQuest, SpringerLink, ScienceDirect, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and Google Scholar were searched for English-language articles published up to 2021. Pooled adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were calculated using a random-effect model with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity was evaluated by using the Cochrane Q test and I2 statistics. The risk of publication bias was estimated using a funnel plot, the Egger test, and the Begg test. The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools were used to assess the quality of evidence and the risk of bias. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included in this meta-analysis, containing a total of 3151 people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pooled analysis showed that people with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had low social support had twice as high a risk of depression as those with high social support (aOR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.51 to 2.70; p&lt;0.001). A random-effect model was used because the heterogeneity was high (I2= 87%). CONCLUSIONS: Low social support was found to increase the risk of depression among people with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

After removing one study that was conducted with an unstandardized questionnaire cut-off value, the pooled prevalence of FSD was 62% (95% CI = 0.58-0.66; I(2) 68.7%, p = 0.001). Age more than 45 years old and or menopause, and the use of antihypertensives were associated with FSD. While Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is only correlated with a desire for sexual dysfunction. CONCLUSION: FSD was prevalent among T2D patients in Indonesia and was associated with age more than 45 years old, menopause, and the use of antihypertensive medications.","Pasaribu A, Astrella C, Kristanti M, Tahapary DL, Shatri H, Soewondo P, Edi Tarigan TJ, Yunir E",Diabetes Metab Syndr,2023 Nov,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
35227186,Effect of Resveratrol in Melinjo Seed (Gnetum gnemon L.) Extract on Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients and its Possible Mechanism: A Review.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Diabetes mellitus is the third leading cause of death in Indonesia (6.7 %), followed by stroke (21.1 %) and coronary heart disease (12.9 %). The prevalence of diabetes worldwide continues to increase on a yearly basis, including in Indonesia. Diabetes is a significant burden for many countries due to the high costs of treatment and reduced productivity of diabetes patients. Comprehensive strategies to prevent and treat diabetes are therefore mandatory. Oral hypoglycemic drugs are the first-line therapy for diabetes mellitus patients; however, these oral drugs still have several side effects. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct studies on medicinal plants with hypoglycemic effects to identify substances that have an anti-diabetic potential resembling physiological processes in the body. Indonesian people often use herbal medicines empirically, but the benefits have not been scientifically documented. Melinjo (Gnetum gnemon L.) is a native Indonesian gymnosperm plant, and the seeds are often processed into food. Melinjo seeds extract contains many polyphenols, including trans-resveratrol. CONCLUSION: Studies on the health benefits of resveratrol are widely available, including antidiabetes and blood sugar control in patients with type 2 diabetes.","Ariyanto EF, Danil AS, Rohmawaty E, Sujatmiko B, Berbudi A",Curr Diabetes Rev,2023,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia

The aim of this paper was to investigate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on symptoms of depression in type 2 diabetic patients. METHODS: The protocol for this review has been registered in PROSPERO:CRD42021231713. Searching for literature was conducted using Pubmed, EBSCOhost, and EMBASE. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) regarding vitamin D supplementation in type 2 diabetic patients with depression were retrieved through a systematic search. The outcome measured was a change in depressive symptoms evaluated with any validated rating scale. Independent data extraction was conducted, and the study quality was assessed. A meta-analysis was carried out to calculate the improvement in depressive symptoms in the group receiving vitamin D and the control group. The available evidence in RCTs was analysed using the PRISMA approach, and clinical significance was determined using the GRADE system. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. RESULTS: Four RCTs were reviewed and three RCTs were meta-analysed. In two studies, vitamin D was statistically effective in improving depressive symptoms in type 2 diabetic patients. Three randomised controlled trials  were included in the meta-analysis with 161 subjects using depression score as an outcome assessment. Vitamin D is significantly more effective than placebo (95% CI: -0.70 to - 0.08, p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Vitamin D supplementation is effective in improving depressive symptoms in type 2 diabetic patients. Future research with different geographical areas and larger samples should be done to further assess the benefits.","Putranto R, Harimurti K, Setiati S, Safitri ED, Saldi SRF, Subekti I, Nasrun MWS, Shatri H",Acta Med Indones,2022 Oct,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
33442132,A Systematic Review on the Association between Lipid Accumulation Product Index and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"INTRODUCTION: Excess fat accumulation contributes to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Lipid accumulation product (LAP) is an index computed from waist circumference and triglycerides, which represents increased lipotoxicity. We aim to study the relationship of LAP index and T2DM and its utility as a predictor for T2DM development. METHODOLOGY: A literature search in PubMed and Cochrane database was performed to retrieve and review studies reporting the association between LAP and T2DM. RESULTS: Two cross-sectional studies from Japan and the United States, and one cohort study from Iran were obtained. A high LAP was associated with a higher risk of T2DM [odds ratio (OR) 19.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) (6.6-55.5) for women; and OR 7.4, 95% CI (5.1-10.8) for men]. CONCLUSION: LAP was strongly associated with T2DM. Its utility in predicting the development of T2DM needs to be confirmed.","Ayundini G, Astrella C, Tahapary D, Soewondo P",J ASEAN Fed Endocr Soc,2019,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
37511848,"Platelet Glycoprotein-Ib (GPIb) May Serve as a Bridge between Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and Atherosclerosis, Making It a Potential Target for Antiplatelet Agents in T2DM Patients.","Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a persistent metabolic condition that contributes to the development of cardiovascular diseases. Numerous studies have provided evidence that individuals with T2DM are at a greater risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, typically two to four times more likely than those without T2DM, mainly due to an increased risk of atherosclerosis. The rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque leading to pathological thrombosis is commonly recognized as a significant factor in advancing cardiovascular diseases caused by TD2M, with platelets inducing the impact of plaque rupture in established atherosclerosis and predisposing to the primary expansion of atherosclerosis. Studies suggest that individuals with T2DM have platelets that display higher baseline activation and reactivity than those without the condition. The expression enhancement of several platelet receptors is known to regulate platelet activation signaling, including platelet glycoprotein-Ib (GPIb). Furthermore, the high expression of platelet GP1b has been reported to increase the risk of platelet adhesion, platelet-leucocyte interaction, and thrombo-inflammatory pathology. However, the study exploring the role of GP1b in promoting platelet activation-induced cardiovascular diseases in T2DM patients is still limited. Therefore, we summarize the important findings regarding pathophysiological continuity between T2DM, platelet GPIb, and atherosclerosis and highlight the potential therapy targeting GPIb as a novel antiplatelet agent for preventing further cardiovascular incidents in TD2M patients.","Amalia M, Puteri MU, Saputri FC, Sauriasari R, Widyantoro B",Life (Basel),2023 Jun 29,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
37707772,Exploring diet-induced promoter hypomethylation and PDK4 overexpression: implications for type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by limited metabolic flexibility in the body. Such limitation implicates the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) gene Poor nutrition, frequently observed among Southeast Asians usually involves excessive intakes of carbohydrates and monosodium glutamate (MSG), that have been frequently linked to an increased risk of T2DM. METHODS: The 14-week study aimed to assess the effects of high-carbohydrate (HC), high-MSG (HMSG), and a combination of high-carbohydrate and high-MSG (HCHMSG) diets on the development of T2DM using male mice. To assess the effects, the male mice were divided into four groups: control (C), HC, HMSG, and HCHMSG for 14 weeks. RESULTS: After 14 weeks, both the HC and HCHMSG groups showed signs of T2DM (168.83 +/- 32.33; 156.42 +/- 32.46). The blood samples from the HMSG, HC, and HCHMSG groups (57.67 +/- 2.882; 49.22 +/- 7.36; 48.9 +/- 6.43) as well as skeletal muscle samples from the HMSG, HC, and HCHMSG groups (57.78 +/- 8.54; 42.13 +/- 7.25; 37.57 +/- 10.42) exhibited a gradual hypomethylation. The HC groups particularly displayed significant PDK4 gene expression in skeletal muscle. A progressive overexpression of the PDK4 gene was observed as well in the HMSG, HCHMSG, and HC groups (2.03 +/- 3.097; 3.21 +/- 2.94; 5.86 +/- 2.54). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that T2DM can be induced by high-carbohydrate and high-MSG diets. However, the sole consumption of high MSG did not lead to the development of T2DM. Further research should focus on conducting long-term studies to fully comprehend the impact of a high MSG diet on individuals with pre-existing T2DM.","Putra SED, Humardani FM, Mulyanata LT, Tanaya LTA, Wijono H, Sulistomo HW, Kesuma D, Ikawaty R",Mol Biol Rep,2023 Nov,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
37153973,Practical considerations for the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors in the Asia-Pacific countries-An expert consensus statement.,"Recent clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of SGLT-2 inhibitors in reducing the risks of cardiovascular and renal events in both patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus. Consequently, many international guidelines have begun advocating for the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors for the purpose of organ protection rather than as simply a glucose-lowering agent. However, despite the consistent clinical benefits and available strong guideline recommendations, the utilization of SGLT-2 inhibitors have been unexpectedly low in many countries, a trend which is much more noticeable in low resource settings. Unfamiliarity with the recent focus in their organ protective role and clinical indications; concerns with potential adverse effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors, including acute kidney injury, genitourinary infections, euglycemic ketoacidosis; and their safety profile in elderly populations have been identified as deterring factors to their more widespread use. This review serves as a practical guide to clinicians managing patients who could benefit from SGLT-2 inhibitors treatment and instill greater confidence in the initiation of these drugs, with the aim of optimizing their utilization rates in high-risk populations.","Liew A, Lydia A, Matawaran BJ, Susantitaphong P, Tran HTB, Lim LL",Nephrology (Carlton),2023 Aug,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
32172486,The genetic basis of high-carbohydrate and high-monosodium glutamate diet related to the increase of likelihood of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a review.,"Diabetes is one of the most common metabolic diseases. Aside from the genetic factor, previous studies stated that other factors such as environment, lifestyle, and paternal-maternal condition play critical roles in diabetes through DNA methylation in specific areas of the genome. One of diabetic cases is caused by insulin resistance and changing the homeostasis of blood glucose control so glucose concentration stood beyond normal rate (hyperglycemia). High fat diet has been frequently studied and linked to triggering diabetes. However, most Asians consume rice (or food with high carbohydrate) and food with monosodium glutamate (MSG). This habit could lead to pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Previous studies showed that high-carbohydrate or high-MSG diet could change gene expression or modify protein activity in body metabolism. This imbalanced metabolism can lead to pleiotropic effects of diabetes mellitus. In this study, the authors have attempted to relate various changes in genes expression or protein activity to the high-carbohydrate and high-MSG-induced diabetes. The authors have also tried to relate several genes that contribute to pathophysiology of T2D and proposed several ideas of genes as markers and target for curing people with T2D. These are done by investigating altered activities of various genes that cause or are caused by diabetes. These genes are selected based on their roles in pathophysiology of T2D.","Nathanael J, Harsono HCA, Wibawa AD, Suardana P, Vianney YM, Dwi Putra SE",Endocrine,2020 Jul,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia

36578896,Factors Associated With Dietary Behaviour Among Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Rural Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is one of the fastest-growing diseases and most serious major health problems worldwide. Few studies have focused on the association of social support with diabetes-related dietary behaviour. OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between social support and dietary behaviour among patients with diabetes in a rural area of Indonesia. METHODOLOGY: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study that included 120 physically healthy patients above 18 years old with T2DM for at least 6 months. Data analysis was done using a stepwise regression model. RESULTS: The mean age was 61.97 years (SD = 7.85, range = 52-74); 86.7% of the participants were females. Social support (beta = 0.272, p = <0.001), diabetes medications (beta = 0.169, p = 0.003), duration of diabetes (beta = 0.118, p = 0.0047), and presence of diabetes complications (beta = 0.197, p = 0.008) were significant predictors of dietary behaviour and accounted for 34.2% of the variance. CONCLUSIONS: Social support, diabetes medications, presence of diabetes complications, and duration of diabetes were associated with improved dietary behaviour. Therefore, social support should be considered when designing dietary interventions for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.","Kurnia AD, Masruroh NL, Melizza N, Prasetyo YB, Hidayani HN",J ASEAN Fed Endocr Soc,2022,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
39463112,Effectiveness and Safety of DLBS3233 in Newly Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A 12-week Clinical Trial.,"BACKGROUND: DLBS3233, recognized as an agent enhancing insulin sensitivity, has exhibited promise as a therapeutic option for addressing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of DLBS3233, a natural compound, in individuals newly diagnosed with T2DM. METHODS: A 12-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted with 104 eligible participants. They were assigned to receive DLBS3233 or a placebo along with lifestyle modifications. Various metabolic parameters, including fasting and post-meal plasma glucose levels at two hours, fasting insulin level, HOMA-IR, adiponectin level, lipid profile, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, GLUT-4 concentrations, and body weight measurements, were assessed at baseline, Week 6, and Week 12. Safety parameters assessment will include vital signs, liver function, renal function and adverse event. RESULTS: Participants exhibited similar demographic characteristics in both groups. While no significant changes were noted in fasting plasma glucose and most other parameters, the DLBS3233 group significantly reduced 2-hour postprandial glucose at Week 12 (p = 0.026). There were no substantial differences in A1c levels, fasting insulin, insulin resistance, adiponectin levels, or lipid profiles between the two groups at any point in time. Safety parameters, including blood pressure, liver enzymes, heart rate, gamma GT, and serum creatinine, remained comparable between the groups. CONCLUSION: DLBS3233 showed potential for improving postprandial glucose control in newly diagnosed T2DM individuals. Although significant changes were limited, the study suggests that DLBS3233 could enhance glycemic regulation. The safety evaluation indicated no adverse effects on vital parameters. Further research with larger samples and more prolonged duration is warranted to comprehensively explore DLBS3233's potential in T2DM management.","Nugroho H, Nurmilawati N, Novitasari D, Rombeallo L, Effendi RF, Reski R, Surayya I, Daryanto NA, Putera S, Tjandrawinata RR",Acta Med Indones,2024 Jul,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
34365924,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with Early Dry Skin Disorder: A Comparison Study Between Primary and Tertiary Care in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in Indonesia has continued to increase over the years. Management of T2DM is challenging across clinical settings, including primary and tertiary care. Uncontrolled T2DM puts patients at risk of the development of T2DM complications, especially early-stage dry skin that is neglected by most of the patients. This study aimed to investigate the comparison between the T2DM management profile and dry skin clinical profile of T2DM patients in primary care and tertiary care settings. METHODS: The study was conducted as a cross-sectional epidemiological study by comparing T2DM patient profiles in primary and tertiary care. The data collected included sociodemographic, clinical, and laboratory data that were correlated with T2DM and early dry skin related-T2DM. This study included early dry skin within the SRRC score of 3-11 and excluded infection, ulcer, and severe erythema. RESULTS: The patients in primary and tertiary care presented poorly controlled T2DM with median HbA1c levels of 7.8% and 7.6%. The patients in primary care also presented with high triglyceride, 179 mg/dl. Furthermore, several significant differences were found in the duration of T2DM, duration of dry skin, and DM treatment (OAD and insulin). CONCLUSION: Significant differences in the duration of T2DM, duration of dry skin, and DM treatment (OAD and insulin) might be affected by the parameter of T2DM glycemic control (Blood pressure (BP), body mass index (BMI), HbA1c, random blood glucose (RBG), and triglyceride).","Legiawati L, Bramono K, Indriatmi W, Yunir E, Pratama AI",Curr Diabetes Rev,2022,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
39465621,Mediating pathways between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and type 2 diabetes mellitus: evidence from a two-step and multivariable Mendelian randomization study.,"AIMS: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a global health burden, more prevalent among individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) compared to the general population. To extend the knowledge base on how ADHD links to T2D, this study aimed to estimate causal effects of ADHD on T2D and to explore mediating pathways. METHODS: We applied a two-step, two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) design, using single nucleotide polymorphisms to genetically predict ADHD and a range of potential mediators. First, a wide range of univariable MR methods was used to investigate associations between genetically predicted ADHD and T2D, and between ADHD and the purported mediators: body mass index (BMI), childhood obesity, childhood BMI, sedentary behaviour (daily hours of TV watching), blood pressure (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure), C-reactive protein and educational attainment (EA). A mixture-of-experts method was then applied to select the MR method most likely to return a reliable estimate. We used estimates derived from multivariable MR to estimate indirect effects of ADHD on T2D through mediators. RESULTS: Genetically predicted ADHD liability associated with 10% higher odds of T2D (OR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.18). From nine purported mediators studied, three showed significant individual mediation effects: EA (39.44% mediation; 95% CI: 29.00%, 49.73%), BMI (44.23% mediation; 95% CI: 34.34%, 52.03%) and TV watching (44.10% mediation; 95% CI: 30.76%, 57.80%). The combination of BMI and EA explained the largest mediating effect (53.31%, 95% CI: -1.99%, 110.38%) of the ADHD-T2D association. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a potentially causal, positive relationship between ADHD liability and T2D, with mediation through higher BMI, more TV watching and lower EA. Intervention on these factors may thus have beneficial effects on T2D risk in individuals with ADHD.","Zhang J, Chen ZK, Triatin RD, Snieder H, Thio CHL, Hartman CA",Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci,2024 Oct 28,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia

METHODS: We performed a comprehensive systematic literature search using PubMed, Scopus, and Embase for records published from inception until 9 February 2021. The effect estimates were reported as relative risks (RRs). RESULTS: 270,229 subjects from 14 studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled incidence of T2DM was 9%. Meta-regression analysis indicates that baseline age (coefficient: 0.67, p = 0.026), drinking (coefficient: 0.03, p = 0.035), and HDL (coefficient: -0.89, p = 0.035) affected the incidence of T2DM in future. High TyG index was associated with increased incidence of T2DM in pooled unadjusted (RR 4.68 [3.01, 7.29], p < 0.001; I(2): 96.6%) and adjusted model (adjusted RR 3.54 [2.75, 4.54], p < 0.001; I(2): 83.7%). Dose-response meta-analysis for the adjusted RR showed that the linear association analysis was not significant per 0.1 increase in TyG index (RR 1.01 [0.99, 1.03], p = 0.223). There is a non-linear trend (p < 0.001) for the association between TyG index and incidence of T2DM. The dose-response curve became increasingly steeper at TyG index above 8.6. CONCLUSIONS: TyG index was associated with the incidence of T2DM in a non-linear fashion.","Pranata R, Huang I, Irvan, Lim MA, Vania R",Endocrine,2021 Nov,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia

32097996,Use of SGLT-2 Inhibitors in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Abdominal Obesity: An Asian Perspective and Expert Recommendations.,"The prevalence of obesity in Asia is of epidemic proportions, with an estimated 1 billion overweight/obese individuals in the region. The majority of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are overweight/obese, which increases the risk of cardiorenal outcomes in these patients; hence, sustained reductions in body weight and visceral adiposity are important management goals. However, most of the glucose-lowering therapies such as insulin, sulfonylureas, glinides, and thiazolidinediones induce weight gain, which makes the management of overweight/obese T2DM patients challenging. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are the only oral glucose-lowering agents that have been shown to reduce body weight and visceral adiposity. In addition, SGLT-2 inhibitors therapy reduces ectopic fat deposition and improves adipose tissue function and weight-related quality of life. In this article, we aim to consolidate the existing literature on the effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors in Asian patients with T2DM and to produce clinical recommendations on their use in overweight or obese patients with T2DM. Recommendations from international and regional guidelines, as well as published data from clinical trials in Asian populations and cardiovascular outcomes trials are reviewed.

RESULTS: Of the 25 studies reviewed, 23(92.2%) were in the English language. They were conducted in 17(51.5%) of the 33 provinces in Indonesia. The questionnaires used were 36-item Short Form 8(32%), EuroQol 5-dimension 5-level scale 6(24%), World Health Organisation Quality of Life-Brief version 6(24%), Diabetes Quality of Life 3(12%) and Diabetes Quality of Life Clinical Trial Questionnaire 2(8%). Variables associated with the quality of life of the diabetics included education, gender and age. The internal factors included glycaemic control, psychological condition, self-efficacy, perception of illness, self-care management, medication adherence, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and complications. The external factors included family support, medication counselling and pharmacists' intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Many instruments measure quality of life related to patients of diabetes mellitus. Countries with different socio-cultural forms have different quality of life perspectives, and the assessment tool should be picked accordingly.","Suniyadewi NW, Sufyanti Y, Kurniawati ND, Putu Inca Buntari Agustin NL, Ayu Rismayanti ID",J Pak Med Assoc,2023 Feb,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
31264765,Use of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and multiple cardiovascular risk factors: An Asian perspective and expert recommendations.,"Diabetes mellitus in Asia accounts for more than half of the global prevalence. There is a high prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the region among people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and it is often associated with multiple risk factors including hypertension, renal disease and obesity. The early onset of T2DM and the eventual long disease duration portends an increasing proportion of the population to premature CVD. In addition to lowering blood glucose, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors exert favourable effects on multiple risk factors (including blood pressure, body weight and renal function) and provide an opportunity to reduce the risk of CVD in patients with T2DM. In this article, we consolidated the existing literature on SGLT-2 inhibitor use in Asian patients with T2DM and established contemporary guidance for clinicians. We extensively reviewed recommendations from international and regional guidelines, published data from clinical trials in the Asian population (dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin, ipragliflozin, luseogliflozin and tofogliflozin), CVD outcomes trials (EMPAREG-OUTCOME, CANVAS and DECLARE-TIMI 58) and real-world evidence studies (CVD-REAL, EASEL, CVD-REAL 2 and OBSERVE-4D). A series of clinical recommendations on the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors in Asian patients with T2DM was deliberated among experts with multiple rounds of review and voting. Based on the available evidence, we conclude that SGLT-2 inhibitors represent an evidence-based therapeutic option for the primary prevention of heart failure hospitalization and secondary prevention of CVD in patients with T2DM, and should be considered early on in the treatment algorithm for patients with multiple risk factors, or those with established CVD.","Deerochanawong C, Chan SP, Matawaran BJ, Sheu WH, Chan J, Man NH, Suastika K, Khoo CM, Yoon KH, Luk A, Mithal A, Linong J",Diabetes Obes Metab,2019 Nov,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
33863354,The differences in health-related quality of life between younger and older adults and its associated factors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: It is well known that diabetes mellitus (DM) affects health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in both younger (aged 18-64 years) and older adults (aged >/= 65 years). However, to date, no study has compared HRQOL and its predictors between younger and older adults with DM in Indonesia. Such a comparison is important because the results can guide nurses and clinicians to establish evidence-based educational programs that are specific and suitable for patients. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the difference in HRQOL and its predictors in younger and older adults with DM in Indonesia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 641 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who were recruited via simple random sampling from 16 primary health centers in Banyumas Regency, Indonesia. A self-administered questionnaire containing the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities, the DDS17 Bahasa Indonesia, the Beck Depression Inventory II, the Self-Efficacy for Diabetes Scale, the Family APGAR, and the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey was used to measure diabetes self-management (DSM), diabetes distress (DD), depression, self-efficacy, family support, and HRQOL, respectively. Independent t-tests were used to compare the physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores between younger and older adults with T2DM. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to examine the factors associated with HRQOL in both groups. RESULTS: PCS scores were significantly different between the two groups. Older adults reported lower PCS scores than younger adults. No differences between the two groups were observed in the MCS scores. The hierarchical multiple regression analysis showed that level of education, employment status, number of diabetes-related complications, DSM, DD, depression, and self-efficacy were significant predictors of HRQOL in younger adults, while income, depression, DD, and self-efficacy were significant predictors of HRQOL in older adults. DD was the strongest predictor of HRQOL in younger adults, and depression was the strongest predictor in older adults. CONCLUSION: Older adult patients had lower PCS scores than younger adult patients. This study is the first to show that the predictors of HRQOL differ between younger and older adults with T2DM. It provides insights for nurses and clinicians in Indonesia to establish evidence-based, age-specific educational programs.","Sari Y, Isworo A, Upoyo AS, Taufik A, Setiyani R, Swasti KG, Haryanto H, Yusuf S, Nasruddin N, Kamaluddin R",Health Qual Life Outcomes,2021 Apr 16,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
31275789,Low muscle mass and inflammation among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Indonesia.,"INTRODUCTION: Chronic inflammation, as observed in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is associated with complications. How chronic inflammation influences body composition in patients with T2DM remains to be investigated. Our study aimed to evaluate the difference of skeletal muscle mass between patients with and without inflammation indicated by plasma high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). METHODS: Patients with T2DM were recruited from primary health care in Sleman district, Indonesia. Measurements were performed to obtain information on body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio, total body fat, subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, mid-upper arm circumference, and muscle mass. Spearman's rank correlation was performed to test the correlation between hs-CRP level and several components of body composition. To test the difference of percent skeletal muscle mass between subjects with and without inflammation (hs-CRP >/= 3 or < 3 mg/dL), general linear model was utilized with adjustment for several variables. Analysis with p value of less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant. RESULT: In all subjects, hs-CRP is correlated with skeletal muscle mass (r: - 0.343; p = 0.04), total body fat (r: 0.353; p = 0.04), and subcutaneous fat (r: 0.369; p = 0.02) but not visceral fat (p: - 0.065; p = ns). Significant difference of skeletal muscle mass between subjects with and without inflammation was found in all and female subjects after adjustment for covariates. CONCLUSION: There was a negative correlation between skeletal muscle mass percentage and inflammation indicated by hs-CRP in type 2 diabetes patients.","Suyoto PST, Aulia B",Diabetol Int,2019 Jul,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
38863918,Efficacy and Safety of Bromocriptine-QR as an Adjunctive Therapy on Glycemic Control in Subjects with Uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: There has been an increasing awareness of the effects of combining bromocriptine-QR with other medications for diabetes mellitus type 2. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of bromocriptine-QR as an adjunctive therapy for patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODOLOGY: This systematic review is registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42022360326). Literature search was done via MEDLINE, NCBI, Google Scholar, Science Direct, Europe PMC and Cochrane Library databases. We included randomized controlled trials with participants 18 years old and above with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus. The primary outcome of interest is the efficacy and safety of bromocriptine-QR as an adjunctive therapy for glycemic control. Case reports, case series, reviews and animal studies were excluded. The risk of bias was reviewed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.4 and presented as a weighted mean difference and 95% confidence interval for changes from the baseline level. RESULTS: Nine studies were included in the systematic review with a total of 2709 participants. The baseline HbA1c in the bromocriptine-QR group was 7.42% and 7.51% in the control group. The bromocriptine-QR group was favoured, outperforming the control group in terms of reducing hemoglobin A1c(HbA1c), with a statistically significant difference (weighted mean difference -0.6%; 95% CI [-0.83,-0.36]; p<0.00001). The most common side effects were nausea (33.75% vs 6.92%), fatigue (13.11% vs 5.94%), and headache (11.17% vs 6.87%). CONCLUSION: Administration of bromocriptine-QR at a dose range of 1.6 to 4.8 mg/day as an adjunctive therapy reduced HbA1c and FBG in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, there were also statistically greater odds of the occurrence of adverse events such as nausea, vomiting, and headache compared to controls.","Yanto TA, Budiputri CL, Muljono MP, Chandra S",J ASEAN Fed Endocr Soc,2024,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
36441733,Integrated Diabetes Self-Management (IDSM) mobile application to improve self-management and glycemic control among patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in Indonesia: A mixed methods study protocol.,"The number of patients with diabetes in Indonesia reach 19,47 million in 2021, mostly is caused by the adoption of sedentary and unhealthy lifestyles. Continuous self-management is important in diabetes care. It requires optimal coordination and communication between patients, families, and health care provider. The use of communication technology could be solution to the problem. This study aims to initiate an android-based mobile apps technology as a tool for patient, family, and healthcare provider to optimize patient with T2DM treatment. This study will be conducted in Public Health Centers (PHCs) in Yogyakarta using an exploratory sequential mixed-methods design which is divided into three phases. The first phase will use qualitative descriptive methods. Patients with T2DM, families, nurses, physicians and Health Social Security Agency officers in Indonesia will be involved in a focus group discussion (FGD) and in-depth interviews to understand their needs in optimizing the treatment. The second phase will be the development of an android-based application on the first phase results. The apps will be usability tested by involving experts (heuristic evaluation) and users (think aloud method) to ensure that the apps really meet targeted user's need. In the third phase, we will collect feedback from user after using this apps for three months. The effectiveness of the apps will be measured by self-management improvement and glycemic control of patients with T2DM. The non-equivalent control group design will be applied using a pre-repeated post-test control group. The result of this study will be an Android-based Application which will be called Integrated Diabetes Self-Management (IDSM) app to optimize the implementation of diabetes self-management which can improve glycemic control of patients with T2DM as one of the indicators of the Indonesian Chronic Disease Management Program at PHCs.","Prihatin Putri DM, Suhoyo Y, Putri Pertiwi AA, Effendy C",PLoS One,2022,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
35398820,"Indonesia DIA-RAMADAN Study: A Real-life, Prospective and Observational of Gliclazide MR in Type-2 Diabetes Patients During Ramadan Fasting.","BACKGROUND: Sulfonylureas (SUs) have been widely used in many countries for T2DM treatment. Gliclazide is one of the SUs with the lowest risk of hypoglycemia; however, the safety and effectiveness of gliclazide MR during Ramadan has not yet been reported in Indonesia. This study aimed to assess safety, efficacy, and tolerability of gliclazide modified release (MR) during Ramadan fasting. METHODS: The study was a part of DIA-RAMADAN study, a prospective observational study with subjects of T2DM patients aged >18 years, who had either controlled or sub-optimally controlled blood glucose level, performed Ramadan fasting. Subjects had been treated with gliclazide MR for at least 90 days prior the study, and were examined for their body mass index (BMI), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c levels 6 to 8 weeks before Ramadan (V0) and 4 to 6 weeks after the end of Ramadan (V1). RESULTS: Out of 198 subjects participating in the study, there were only two subjects (1.0%) who reported symptomatic HEs (either confirmed or not confirmed) and no severe HEs had been reported. There were no significant changes in HbA1c and FPG levels (p>0.05). Interestingly, there was a reduction of bodyweight (-0.4kg) from pre- to post-Ramadan (p < 0.001). Almost no subjects reported discontinuation of gliclazide MR throughout the entire study; however, there was one subject who reported a change of diabetic treatment into diet only. CONCLUSION: gliclazide MR is safe, well tolerated and can maintain glycemic control effectively for Indonesian patients with T2DM who perform Ramadan fasting.","Soelistijo SA, Aman AM, Zufry H, Pranoto A, Rudijanto A, Hassanien M",Acta Med Indones,2022 Jan,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
35122903,Prevalence and correlates of diabetes distress and depressive symptoms among individuals with type-2 diabetes mellitus during Ramadan fasting: A cross-sectional study in Bangladesh amid the COVID-19.,"AIMS: Psychological concerns relating to ""diabetes distress"" (DD) and depressive symptoms (DS) in individuals with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) may negatively impact adherence to medical treatments and overall mental health. Thus, this study was undertaken to investigate DS and DD in relation to fasting during the month of Ramadan. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 735 patients with T2DM in 2021. DD and DS were measured by the Problem Areas in Diabetes scale and Patient Health Questionnaire-9, respectively. Logistic regression and correlation analyses were executed. RESULTS: More than one-third of the participants (41.2%) had DD and DS (36.9%). DS was significantly higher in participants who did not fast (p = 0.027). Participants who had higher dietary diversity were less likely to have DD (p = 0.004) and DS (p = 0.001). Females (AOR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.25-2.85) and those who lived alone (AOR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.25-2.85) were more likely to have DS. Participants with diabetes-related complications were more likely to experience DS (AOR = 2.17; 95% CI: 1.5-3.13) and DD (AOR = 3.46; 95% CI: 2.42-4.95). DD was also associated with being younger (p = 0.003), having hypertension (p = 0.030), having heart disease (p = 0.012), and taking insulin (p = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with T2DM who were not fasting experienced more mental health concerns. Psychosocial support and other interventions from health professionals should be examined and empirical interventions should be implemented to promote the mental health and well-being of individuals with T2DM.","Sultana MS, Islam MS, Sayeed A, Potenza MN, Sikder MT, Rahman MA, Koly KN",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,2022 Mar,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
39247104,The Association between Drug-Related Problems and Length of Stay of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients.,"INTRODUCTION: Drug-related problems (DRPs) are treatment-related occurrences that affect therapeutic efficacy. In a previous study, approximately 279 out of 330 (84.5%) patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) had experienced at least one DRP, including non-optimal drug effects (n = 240, 52.7%) and indications without medication (n = 137, 30.1%). Patients who were hospitalised for 5-10 days had the highest number of DRPs. Therefore, this study investigates the association between DRPs and length of stay (LoS) in patients with T2DM. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from January 2020 to May 2023 at Rumah Sakit Akademik, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Clinical pharmacists reviewed electronic health data to examine DRPs. The Fisher's exact test evaluated the association between DRPs and LoS. RESULTS: A total of 60.7% (n = 17) of the participants were females, with the majority falling into the age group >/= 65 years old (n = 11, 29.7%). A significant portion experienced LoS > 7 days (n = 17, 60.7%). Antidiabetic monotherapy was predominant, and the categories of DRPs included adverse drug reaction (n = 15, 40.5%), dosage too high (n = 6, 16.2%), wrong drug (n = 6, 16.2%), non-adherence (n = 4, 10.8%), need for additional therapy (n = 4, 10.8%) and dosage too low (n = 2, 5.4%). A significant association was observed between non-adherence and LoS (P = 0.016). The possibility of experiencing LoS of 1-7 days increased by 3.43 times with improved non-adherence (OR = 3.43; 95% CI: 1.83, 6.39). In this context, non-adherence refers to DRPs associated with the non-compliance of patients with the prescribed treatment plan. CONCLUSION: This study concludes that non-adherence was significantly associated with hospital LoS.","Larasati N, Satibi S, Kristina SA, Lazuardi L",Malays J Med Sci,2024 Aug,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
36891960,Synergistic Interactions of Insufficient Physical Activity and a High Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index on Psychological Problems in Indonesians With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"BACKGROUND: High-grade inflammation represents a critical contribution to the onset of depression and might be manageable by physical activity (PA). Nevertheless, no study has examined synergistic interactions of insufficient PA and high values of the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) on psychological problems. OBJECTIVE: We investigated independent and synergistic interactions of insufficient PA and high SII levels on stress, anxiety, and depression in T2DM patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional research design with 294 T2DM patients was conducted. An XP-100 automated hematology analyzer was used to evaluate inflammatory biomarkers. Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 items and a standardized questionnaire about PA were respectively used to measure psychological problems and metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-h/week. RESULTS: A multiple linear regression demonstrated that patients with insufficient PA were significantly more likely to have higher stress (beta = 1.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03-2.65), anxiety (beta = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.81-2.96), and depression (beta = 2.53, 95% CI = 0.82-4.24) than those with active PA. A high SII level was a key predictor and was most strongly associated with stress (beta = 2.61, 95% CI = 2.02-3.20), anxiety (beta = 3.16, 95% CI = 2.37-3.94), and depression (beta = 3.72, 95% CI = 2.49-4.96) compared to those who had low SII levels. Notably, additive interaction results showed that combining insufficient PA and a high SII level had a significantly escalated 1.71-fold risk of stress, 1.82-fold risk of anxiety, and 2.69-fold risk of depression. CONCLUSIONS: Active PA and a low SII had a positive synergistic effect of decreasing psychological problems.","Rias YA, Tsai HT, Thato R, Apriyanto BS, Chou KR, Ho SC, Sun CH",Biol Res Nurs,2023 Oct,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
36635653,Attitudes towards deprescribing and patient-related factors associated with willingness to stop medication among older patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Indonesia: a cross-sectional survey study.,"BACKGROUND: Deprescribing of preventive medication is recommended in older patients with polypharmacy, including people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). It seems that many patients in low-middle-income countries are not willing to have their medicines deprescribed. This study aims to assess attitudes of Indonesian patients with T2D towards deprescribing in general and regarding specific cardiometabolic medicines, and factors influencing their willingness to stop medicines. METHODS: Primary care patients with T2D of >/=60 years in Indonesia completed the revised Patients' Attitudes Towards Deprescribing (rPATD) questionnaire. Attitudes in general and for cardiometabolic medicines were reported descriptively. Proportions of patients willing to stop one or more medicines when recommended by different healthcare professionals were compared with Chi-square test. Multiple regression analysis was used to analyse the influence between patient-related factors and the willingness to stop medicines. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 196 participants (median age 69 years, 73% female). The percentages willing to stop medicines were 69, 67, and 41%, when the general practitioner (GP), the specialist, or the pharmacist initiates the process (p-value < 0.001). Higher perceived burden of medicines (p-value = 0.03) and less concerns about stopping (p-value < 0.001) were associated with a higher willingness to stop medicines if proposed by the GP. Patients using multiple glucose-regulating medicines were less willing to stop (p-value = 0.02). Using complementary or alternative medicines was not associated with the willingness to stop. If proposed by their pharmacist, patients without substantial education were more willing to stop than educated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Only two-thirds of older people with T2D in Indonesia were willing to stop one or more of their medicines if the GP or specialist recommended this, and even less when the pharmacist proposed this. Attention should be given to concerns about stopping specific medicines, especially among patients using multiple glucose-lowering medicines, who may be more eligible but were less willing to accept deprescribing.","Oktora MP, Yuniar CT, Amalia L, Abdulah R, Hak E, Denig P",BMC Geriatr,2023 Jan 12,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia

People with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) need appropriate treatment strategies to maintain glycemic control. New modalities with simplicity, such as fixed-ratio combination of basal insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), further referred to as FRC, have proven to be an effective and practical therapeutic approach that may address this issue. In January 2021, a scientific expert meeting was held with the participation of endocrinologists from Indonesia to provide expert opinions regarding the optimal practical use of the FRC basal insulin/GLP1-RA. Topics discussed in the meeting included the challenges in diabetes management, clinical inertia with insulin therapy, local and international guideline positioning, initiation, titration, and switching of basal insulin and GLP-1 RA, including FRC, and the management of T2DM.","Suastika K, Eliana F, Kshanti IAM, Mardianto M, Mudjarnako SW, Natalia N, Hs HN, Sibarani RP, Soewondo P, Soelistijo SA, Tarigan TJE, Zufry H",Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes,2022,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
37166083,Physical Activity and Its Synergistic Interaction With Low Platelet-Lymphocyte Ratio Levels Increasing the Sleep Quality in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to explore the effect of synergistic interaction and the independence of physical activity and inflammatory markers, including platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), on sleep quality in persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional study included 294 persons with T2DM in East Java, Indonesia. Fasting blood was analyzed for inflammation markers, including NLR and PLR. Physical activity and sleep quality were assessed using Metabolic Equivalent of Task and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression, chi-square test, and independent t test were performed. RESULTS: There was an independently significant relationship between physical activity, NLR, and PLR with sleep quality. Persons with both active physical activity and low PLRs were 12.52 times more likely to have high sleep quality scores than those with low physical activity and high PLRs. A positive additive interaction of active physical activity and low PLRs for high sleep quality scores was identified. CONCLUSION: Physical activity, NLR, and PLR revealed an independently significant relationship with sleep quality. Persons with both active physical activity levels and low PLR were the most substantial synergistic effect of high sleep quality. Further studies are necessary to examine the problems and solutions for sleep quality in this population.","Rias YA, Thato R, Tsai HT",Sci Diabetes Self Manag Care,2023 Aug,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia

33669379,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) Treatment in Patients with Complications of Kidney and Peripheral Vascular Diseases in Indonesia.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disease with high-cost treatment. This study aimed to analyze the cost-effectiveness of T2DM treatment in hospitalized patients with complications of kidney and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) in Indonesia by focusing on patients of Health Social Security Agency (BPJS Kesehatan). An observational study was applied by collecting data retrospectively from patients' medical record at the biggest public hospital in West Java Province, Indonesia. Two perspectives of payer and healthcare provider were applied to estimate the treatment cost. We considered following inclusion criteria: (i) Hospitalized T2DM patients without complication, with complications of kidney and PVD during 2014-2017; (ii) member of BPJS Kesehatan; (iii) >18 years old patients; and (iv) patients with complete medical record data. The results showed that the majority patients were female (56.72%), 45-64 years old (69.40%), and had a length of stay at 4-10 days (54.48%). The greatest contributions in the total treatment cost were found to be hospital room, medical services and medicines for the treatment of T2DM without complications, with complications of kidney and PVD, respectively. From the perspective of payer, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of T2DM treatment with complications of kidney and PVD would be IDR 215,723 and IDR 234,591 per 1 mg/dL blood glucose reduction, respectively. From the perspective of healthcare provider, the ICERs of T2DM treatment with complications of kidney and PVD would be IDR 166,289 and IDR 681,853 per 1 mg/dL blood glucose reduction in both perspectives (1 US$ = IDR 13,451). In a comparison with T2DM without complication, reducing 1 mg/dL blood glucose in T2DM treatment with complication of PVD would require higher cost than in T2DM treatment with complication of kidney from both perspectives.","Priyadi A, Permana H, Muhtadi A, Sumiwi SA, Sinuraya RK, Suwantika AA",Healthcare (Basel),2021 Feb 16,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
38952969,Prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension in patient's visiting the conservative dentistry and endodontics department: a cross-sectional study in Surabaya City.,"BACKGROUND: This descriptive cross-sectional study focuses on the prevalence of hypertension (HTN) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) amongst patients who visited the Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics department. Recognizing these incidence statistics is critical for improving endodontic therapy delivery and assuring high-quality dental care with positive treatment outcomes. METHODS: In advance of getting dental care, all patients visiting the department were advised to get their blood sugar and blood pressure levels checked at random. Measurements were taken with digital equipment, and individuals with high levels were encouraged to seek medical advice before undergoing dental procedures. The obtained data was imported into Excel and analyzed with IBM SPSS software (version 21). RESULTS: The investigation had 1,100 participants (55.8% female and 44.2% male), with an average age of 44.58 +/- 12.77 years. Of the individuals, 40.6% were referred for type 2 diabetes, 12.6% for hypertension, and 24.0% for both diseases. There was a significant correlation (p < 0.05) between referral status and gender. The average blood pressure and random blood sugar readings were 141.02 mmHg +/- 56.28 mmHg (systolic), 79.83 mmHg +/- 10.68 mmHg (diastolic), and 126.68 mg/dL +/- 15.36 mg/dL, respectively. There was a substantial (p < 0.05) difference in mean systolic blood pressure between men and women. Furthermore, age was strongly connected with random blood sugar levels (p < 0.05) and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.05). There were significant (p < 0.05) variations in mean blood pressure and blood sugar levels between referred and non-referred individuals. CONCLUSION: Age had a relationship with higher random blood sugar levels, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure. Dentists should consider patient age while planning treatment, as type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension require unique techniques to emphasize patient safety and produce excellent outcomes.","Manihar M, Wahjuningrum DA, Manihar S, Pawar AM, Atram J, Banga K, Luke AM, Elmsmari F",PeerJ,2024,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia

Counseling and medication booklets were distributed three times during the study period, while SMS reminders were sent once a week. Counseling was given for the management of diabetes mellitus (DM), including during the Ramadan fasting period, together with management for acute and chronic complications. The medication adherence level was measured using a medication adherence questionnaire (MAQ) and pill count adherence (PCA). The study sample comprised 80 T2DM patients, who were allocated into either the control group (CG) (n = 40) or intervention group (IG) (n = 40). Clinical outcomes were determined by measuring glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), blood pressure, and lipid profiles. FINDINGS: After the intervention, the IG showed significant improvements in most parameters, except for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. HbA1c levels were reduced, while MAQ scores and PCA scores were improved. Lipid parameters were significantly reduced total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), and triglyceride (TG). Compared with the CG, most parameters were significantly improved in the IG. Pharmacist counseling significantly improved almost all clinical parameters (HbA1c, TC, LDL-c, and TG). Pharmacist counseling was 7.1 times greater in lowering HbA1c compared with no counseling, after adjusted by other variables. The variable that most influenced the lowering of HbA1c was infrequent (""not often"") consumption of unhealthy foods (OR 14.9; 95% CI 3.5-63.7). CONCLUSION: The pharmacist primary health-care intervention program implemented in this study significantly improved HbA1c, TC, LDL-c, TG, and medication adherence in outpatients with T2DM.","Besemah NA, Sartika RAD, Sauriasari R",J Res Pharm Pract,2020 Oct-Dec,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
35807241,"Computational Study of Asian Propolis Compounds as Potential Anti-Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Agents by Using Inverse Virtual Screening with the DIA-DB Web Server, Tanimoto Similarity Analysis, and Molecular Dynamic Simulation.","Propolis contains a wide range of pharmacological activities because of their various bioactive compounds. The beneficial effect of propolis is interesting for treating type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) owing to dysregulation of multiple metabolic processes. In this study, 275 of 658 Asian propolis compounds were evaluated as potential anti-T2DM agents using the DIA-DB web server towards 18 known anti-diabetes protein targets. More than 20% of all compounds could bind to more than five diabetes targets with high binding affinity (<-9.0 kcal/mol). Filtering with physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties, including ADMET parameters, 12 compounds were identified as potential anti-T2DM with favorable ADMET properties. Six of those compounds, (2R)-7,4'-dihydroxy-5-methoxy-8-methylflavone; (RR)-(+)-3'-senecioylkhellactone; 2',4',6'-trihydroxy chalcone; alpinetin; pinobanksin-3-O-butyrate; and pinocembrin-5-methyl ether were first reported as anti-T2DM agents. We identified the significant T2DM targets of Asian propolis, namely retinol-binding protein-4 (RBP4) and aldose reductase (AKR1B1) that have important roles in insulin sensitivity and diabetes complication, respectively. Molecular dynamic simulations showed stable interaction of selected propolis compounds in the active site of RBP4 and AKR1B1. These findings suggest that Asian propolis compound may be effective for treatment of T2DM by targeting RBP4 and AKR1B1.","Syaifie PH, Harisna AH, Nasution MAF, Arda AG, Nugroho DW, Jauhar MM, Mardliyati E, Maulana NN, Rochman NT, Noviyanto A, Banegas-Luna AJ, Perez-Sanchez H",Molecules,2022 Jun 21,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia

36204396,Acute Effects of Breakfast Fruits Meal Sequence and Postprandial Exercise on the Blood Glucose Level and DPP4 Activity among Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients: A Pilot Study.,"OBJECTIVES: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major global public health issue. Diet and physical exercise are modifiable factors that influence the glycaemic status of patients with T2DM. We aimed to investigate the acute effects of breakfast fruits meal sequence and postprandial exercise on the blood glucose level and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) activity among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. METHODS: A randomized pilot study recruited patients with T2DM who attended two primary health care centres in Tasikmadu District, Karanganyar Regency, and Kartasura District, Sukoharjo Regency, Central Java, Indonesia, from July to October 2016. Eligible patients (4 men and 32 women) were randomly divided into four treatment groups. Venous blood samples were analyzed for fasting and one-hour postprandial blood glucose (FBG and 1 h PPG) levels and DPP4 activity. Blood glucose levels were measured using a routine hexokinase method, and serum DPP4 activity was determined spectrophotometrically after incubation with the Gly-Pro-p-nitroanilide substrate. RESULTS: Fruits last meal decreased FBG level whilst fruits first meal did not significantly decrease 1 h PPG level. Both treatments had no acute effects on DPP4 activity but the addition of postprandial exercise helped lower DPP4 activity. Fruit last and first meals showed significant opposite effects on mean changes of FBG level (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary report of fruits meal sequence is potentially involved in acute regulation of blood glucose levels and that it might be independent of DPP4 activity in Indonesian patients with T2DM. Moreover, postprandial exercise may be an important intervention for T2DM through the mediation of DPP4 but has no acute effects on the regulation of blood glucose levels. Further studies are required to investigate whether or not different types of fruits and longer treatment intervals can affect blood glucose levels and DPP4 activity differently. This study also gives an insight into the feasibility of conducting food order modification with or without the combination of postprandial exercise in a primary health setting for our next studies.","Dono I, Dwipajati D, Dirgahayu P, Wibowo YC, Pratama YM",J Obes,2022,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
33972194,"The knowledge, attitude, practice and predictors of complementary and alternative medicine use among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Indonesia.","OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) usage among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Indonesia is high. However, to date, little is known about why Indonesian T2DM patients choose CAM therapies, how their knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of CAM affects their choices, or how demographics correlate with patient choices. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the KAP and predictors of CAM usage in T2DM patients in Indonesia. METHODS: This was an observational, cross-sectional study. Patients were interviewed using a questionnaire. Chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests were used to compare demographic and clinical data, as well as KAP assessments, between T2DM patients who use and do not use CAM. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to investigate predictors of CAM usage. RESULTS: A total of 628 T2DM patients were enrolled in the study. CAM therapies were used by 341 patients (54.3%). The most common therapies were herbs and spiritual healing, used by 100.0% and 68.3% of CAM-using patients, respectively. CAM therapies were frequently recommended by family members (91.5%), and CAM users had significantly more knowledge and more positive attitudes toward CAM therapies than nonusers. Among users, 66% said they would not follow their healthcare providers' instructions to not use CAM therapies, and 69.5% said they would not disclose their plan to use CAM therapies with their healthcare provider. Neither demographic nor clinical characteristics were associated with CAM use. The factors that best predicted the use of CAM therapies were their availability and low cost (odds ratio [OR] = 4.59; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.01-7.01), the belief that CAM therapies were safe (OR = 2.04; 95% CI: 1.40-2.95), the belief that CAM therapies could help with diabetes control (OR = 1.75; 95% CI: 1.15-2.66), and the belief that CAM therapies could help maintain physical health (OR = 1.68; 95% CI: 1.13-2.49). CONCLUSION: CAM therapy users were more knowledgeable and had more positive attitudes toward CAM, but most of them chose not to disclose their CAM use to their healthcare providers. CAM use in Indonesia was associated with its accessibility, affordability, safety and effectivity, but not with any demographic or clinical characteristics. This study provided new evidence and insights for nurses and physicians in Indonesia that will help to design educational programs about the safety and efficacy of CAM therapies.","Sari Y, Anam A, Sumeru A, Sutrisna E",J Integr Med,2021 Jul,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
33393899,"Genomics, Proteomics and Metabolomics Approaches for Predicting Diabetic Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients.","BACKGROUND: There is a continuous rise in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) worldwide and most patients are unaware of the presence of this chronic disease at the early stages. T2DM is associated with complications related to long-term damage and failure of multiple organ systems caused by vascular changes associated with glycated end products, oxidative stress, mild inflammation, and neovascularization. Among the most frequent complications of T2DM observed in about 20-40% of T2DM patients is diabetes nephropathy (DN). METHODS: A literature search was made in view of highlighting the novel applications of genomics, proteomics and metabolomics, as the new prospective strategy for predicting DN in T2DM patients. RESULTS: The complexity of DN requires a comprehensive and unbiased approach to investigate the main causes of disease and identify the most important mechanisms underlying its development. With the help of evolving throughput technology, rapidly evolving information can now be applied to clinical practice. DISCUSSION: DN is also the leading cause of end-stage renal disease and comorbidity independent of T2DM. In terms of the comorbidity level, DN has many phenotypes; therefore, timely diagnosis is required to prevent these complications. Currently, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are gold standards for assessing glomerular damage and changes in renal function. However, GFR estimation based on creatinine is limited to hyperfiltration status; therefore, this makes albuminuria and eGFR indicators less reliable for early-stage diagnosis of DN. CONCLUSION: The combination of genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics assays as suitable biological systems can provide new and deeper insights into the pathogenesis of diabetes, as well as discover prospects for developing suitable and targeted interventions.","Darmayanti S, Lesmana R, Meiliana A, Abdulah R",Curr Diabetes Rev,2021,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
31190848,Carotid intima-media thickness among normoglycemia and normotension first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Introduction: Theoretically, first-degree relatives (FDRs) of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are predisposed to have earlier and more severe atherosclerosis than non-FDR due to hereditary insulin resistance. A previous study reported that atherosclerotic plaques were found in 45.2% of young adults FDR of T2DM, but the study did not include non-FDR as control group. The aim of this study was to compare subclinical atherosclerosis (carotid intima-media thickness, CIMT) between FDR of T2DM and non-FDR. Method: This was a cross-sectional study involving 16 FDR subjects and 16 age-sex matched non-FDR subjects, aged 19-40 years, with normal glucose tolerance and no hypertension. Collected data included demographic characteristic, anthropometric measurement (BMI and waist circumference), laboratory analysis (fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, lipid profile), and CIMT examination (using B-mode ultrasound). Results: The mean of CIMT in the FDR group was higher than that in the non-FDR group (0.44 mm vs 0.38 mm, p=0.005). After adjusting for waist circumference, BMI, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride, CIMT maintained significant difference between FDR and non-FDR subjects. BMI and waist circumference showed moderate correlation with CIMT. Conclusion: CIMT in young adult FDR of T2DM is thicker than that in age-and sex-matched non-FDR population.","Purnamasari D, Abdaly MS, Azizi MS, Wijaya IP, Nugroho P",Vasc Health Risk Manag,2019,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
38047423,"Different doses of imeglimin for management of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression of randomized clinical trials.","BACKGROUND: A new medication for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) called imeglimin can target all three organs involved in the pathogenesis of DM, namely the liver, skeletal muscles, and pancreas. This research seeks to examine the most efficacious and safe dose of imeglimin for the management of T2DM. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using particular keywords, we searched the CENTRAL, Medline, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases for pertinent literature. The results of continuous variables were pooled into the mean difference (MD) and dichotomous variables into odds ratio (OR) along with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) using fixed-effect models. RESULTS: Our pooled analysis revealed that imeglimin 1000 mg twice daily [MD -0.90% p < 0.00001] and 1500 mg twice daily [MD -0.84% p = 0.0003] as monotherapy was associated with a higher reduction in the HbA(1c) compared to placebo. This superiority was still maintained when given as combination therapy. Regrettably, there was an observed escalation in gastrointestinal AEs as the dosage of imeglimin was raised, despite the absence of a corresponding improvement in its efficacy in decreasing HbA(1c) levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that imeglimin 1000 mg twice daily may offer the most optimum therapeutic effects for glycemic control without compromising its safety profiles.","Permana H, Soetedjo NNM, Yanto TA, Tendean M, Hariyanto TI, Suastika K",Expert Rev Endocrinol Metab,2024 Jan-May,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
38450390,Association between depression and HbA1c levels in the elderly population with type 2 diabetes mellitus during COVID-19 pandemic.,"Diabetes mellitus is a chronic progressive disease affecting the metabolic hormonal system and its prevalence in the elderly population is high. Depression is one of the psychiatric disorders in diabetic patients in particular during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. People with depression are more susceptible to leading an unhealthy lifestyle; therefore, depression and diabetes have a negative influence on life quality and aggravate complications and symptoms. The aim of this study was to determine the association between depression and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in elderly with type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. A cross-sectional study was conducted where a total of 42 diabetic patients from the Puskesmas Belakang Padang, Batam of Indonesia was recruited. The HbA1c level, the main determinant of optimum glycemic control, was measured using ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography while the level of depression was assessed using Geriatric Depression Scale-15 (GDS-15). The association between depression and HbA1c levels was analyzed using the chi-squared test. Our study found that that 69% of the elderly with diabetes experienced a depression, classified as mild (40.5%), moderate (21.4%) and severe (7.1%). There were 61.9% of the subjects had poor HbA1c control. Our data suggested that the depression level was associated with HbA1c (p = 0.002). In conclusion, there is a significant association between depression and HbA1c levels in the elderly with type 2 diabetes mellitus.","Zahra Z, Ramadhani CT, Mamfaluti T, Pamungkas SR, Firdausa S",Narra J,2022 Apr,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
39687000,"The association between fibroblast growth factor 21 with diabetes retinopathy among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression.","BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, is a common complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) driven by chronic hyperglycemia and microvascular damage. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is crucial in blood sugar regulation and has been linked to DR incidence and severity. While some studies suggest that FGF21 levels may contribute to the DR incidence, others propose a protective role. This discrepancy necessitates further analysis, prompting this study to evaluate the association between FGF21 levels and DR incidence and severity in T2DM patients. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted through MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase up to May 2024 for studies evaluating the association between FGF21 and DR incidence and severity. A random-effect model meta-analysis was performed to calculate the pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). A univariate meta-regression was performed to analyze factors influencing pooled size estimates. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA 17 software. RESULT: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 5,852 participants revealed that FGF21 was positively correlated with DR (SMD 3.11; 95% CI [0.92-5.30], p = 0.005) and sight-threatening DR (STDR) incidence (SMD 3.61; 95% CI [0.82-6.41], p = 0.01). There was no significant difference in FGF21 levels in DR vs STDR (p = 0.79). Subgroup analysis revealed a significant difference in DR incidence between LDL groups, with higher DR incidence in the group with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels >100 (P < 0.00001). Meta-regression revealed no variables significantly influenced the pooled size estimates. CONCLUSION: A higher level of FGF21 was associated with higher DR and STDR incidence among T2DM patients, highlighting its potential utilization as a biomarker for DR detection and enabling the exploration of FGF21-based treatment strategies. However, variables independently predicting DR among patients with elevated FGF21 levels shall be explored further.

32744488,"Prevalence of the Effects of Anxiety and Depression on People with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: An Analysis of Health Policy Studies in Improving the Quality of Life of Poor Families in the Urban Areas of West Lombok, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: To explore the tendency of the effects of anxiety and depression that occur in type 2 diabetes patients, especially poor patients who live in the urban areas with poor economic conditions, who do not have health access from the government, and live away from the hospitals. METHODS: It is a cross-sectional study which aimed to determine the number of patients who experienced anxiety and depression problems due to the declining health conditions caused by diabetes. A sample size of 98 diabetics experiencing anxiety and depression when the treatment was carried out was included. The study design included a qualitative study with in-depth interviews with respondents who were at risk of diabetes, as well as to determine the level of anxiety and depression that occurred when medical care was provided and the feelings experienced by the respondents after the completion of treatment. RESULTS: Diabetic patients are generally unaware that their illness is a chronic disease that takes a long time to treat. When the patients are sick, most of them do not immediately go to the hospital or a specialist to get their health examination and treatment, because the hospital is far from the patients' residence. Furthermore, some patients still use traditional medicine and non-medical treatment, so when the patients with critical conditions are taken to the hospital, they already have chronic diabetes. CONCLUSION: The lack of access to health for chronic patients with poor economic conditions who live far from the hospitals and the scarcity of medical staff to carry out treatment of chronic diseases such as diabetes for poor patients in urban areas certainly have an impact on increasing the number of patients with chronic diseases. Therefore, the government is expected to be able to provide easy health policies to remote rural communities in order to achieve optimal community welfare and health.","Nasirin C, Lionardo A",Curr Diabetes Rev,2020,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
29093238,Multidiscipline Care for Type 2 Diabetes Patients: from General to Asian Population.,"Multidiscipline care is defined as a care consisting of at least a physician, a nurse, and other healthcare worker (eg. dietician). Multidiscipline care has generated benefits, both in medical aspects (eg. increasing patients' compliance) and nonmedical aspects (eg. more cost-effective than conventional treatment). There are several models of multidiscpline care; however, which model is more suitable for type 2 diabetes care is not clear yet. In this review, we aimed to identify and compare multidiscipline care method for reducing glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1C) levels in type 2 diabetes patients, particularly Asian patients because they have greater tendency to develop type 2 diabetes at lower degrees of obesity and at younger ages than Caucasian ethnic group. There were limited number of studies examining multidiscipline care for type 2 diabetes patients, moreover for Asian patients. They showed mixed results on the efficacy of multidiscipline care in achieving HbA1C target. Healthcare personnel visit, either personal or group session, appeared effective both for general and Asian T2DM patients. It needs further studies to clarify which models are most effective for practices of varying cultures, socio-economic condition, and healthcare settings.","Suwita BM, Friska D, Widjaja DS, Srisawitri L",Acta Med Indones,2017 Jul,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia

26119261,Parasitic helminths and their beneficial impact on type 1 and type 2 diabetes.,"It is estimated that by the year 2035 almost 600 million people will suffer from diabetes. In the case of type 2 diabetes, the strongest increase of diabetes incidence occurs in developing and newly industrialized countries. This increase correlates not only with a progressing sedentary lifestyle and nutritional changes, but also environmental changes. Similarly, the increase of type 1 diabetes incidence in industrialized countries over the past decades cannot be explained by genetic factors alone, suggesting that environmental changes are also involved. One such environmental change is a reduced exposure to pathogens because of improved hygiene. Parasitic helminths modulate the immune system of their hosts and induce type 2 as well as regulatory immune responses. As pro-inflammatory immune responses are crucial for the onset of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, helminth-induced immunomodulation may prevent diabetes onset and ameliorate insulin sensitivity. Several epidemiological studies in human and experimental animal models support such a protective effect of helminths for autoimmune diabetes. Recent studies further suggest that helminths may also provide such a beneficial effect for type 2 diabetes. In this review we summarize studies that investigated parasitic helminths and helminth-derived products and their impact on both type 1 and type 2 diabetes highlighting potential protective mechanisms.","Berbudi A, Ajendra J, Wardani AP, Hoerauf A, Hubner MP",Diabetes Metab Res Rev,2016 Mar,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia

We conducted and compared the DMSM practice and clinical value at baseline and 12 weeks after completing the program. The DMSM based coaching program was a 12-week program with several strategies based on a self-management model. The findings showed that patients who received the DMSM based coaching program have a positive effect on DMSM practice and metabolic marker except for body mass index (BMI). This study revealed that the DMSM based coaching program was practical and feasible for implementation in a broad population with uncontrolled T2DM in Indonesia.","Pamungkas RA, Chamroonsawasdi K",Diabetes Metab Syndr,2020 Jan-Feb,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
25888525,"Helminth infections and type 2 diabetes: a cluster-randomized placebo controlled SUGARSPIN trial in Nangapanda, Flores, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance is a strong predictor of the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Chronic helminth infections might protect against insulin resistance via a caloric restriction state and indirectly via T-helper-2 polarization of the immune system. Therefore the elimination of helminths might remove this beneficial effect on insulin resistance. METHODS/DESIGN: To determine whether soil-transmitted helminth infections are associated with a better whole-body insulin sensitivity and whether this protection is reversible by anthelmintic treatment, a household-based cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in the area of Nangapanda on Flores Island, Indonesia, an area endemic for soil-transmitted helminth infections. The trial incorporates three monthly treatment with albendazole or matching placebo for one year, whereby each treatment round consists of three consecutive days of supervised drug intake. The presence of soil-transmitted helminths will be evaluated in faeces using microscopy and/or PCR. The primary outcome of the study will be changes in insulin resistance as assessed by HOMA-IR, while the secondary outcomes will be changes in body mass index, waist circumference, fasting blood glucose, 2 h-glucose levels after oral glucose tolerance test, HbA1c, serum lipid levels, immunological parameters, and efficacy of anthelmintic treatment. DISCUSSION: The study will provide data on the effect of helminth infections on insulin resistance. It will assess the relationship between helminth infection status and immune responses as well as metabolic parameters, allowing the establishment of a link between inflammation and whole-body metabolic homeostasis.

34522111,Effect of Angiotensin Receptor Blocker and Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitor on Kidney Function and Blood Potassium Level in Indonesian Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with Hypertension: A Three-Month Cohort Study.,"PURPOSE: National formulary restrictions in Indonesia (2019) require estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) to be able to prescribe telmisartan and valsartan and ACE-I intolerance to be able to prescribe irbesartan and candesartan. These restrictions are based on economic considerations and differ from American Diabetes Association (ADA) (2020) guidelines which allow equal use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) without restriction. Since there is a need to evaluate the different effects of ACE-I and ARB in the Indonesian hypertensive type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) population, we compare their effects on urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and blood potassium level. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study at RSUPN Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital was conducted in 123 T2DM patients. We followed the study subjects prospectively for three months using a validated questionnaire, health record, and laboratory data. RESULTS: After 3 months of observation, there were no significant changes, except increased BMI values (p = 0.046) in the ACE-I group, and decreased LDL value (p = 0.016) and HDL value (p = 0.004) in the ARB group. Multivariate analysis showed that the consumption of ACE-I or ARB was not associated with a decrease/constant of UACR or increase potassium level, even after adjusting by confounding variables. Interestingly, we found ARB was more likely to increase eGFR, but the significance was lost once the duration of ACE-I/ARB use was entered into the model. In addition, BMI >25 kg/m(2) was a significant factor associated with decreased/constant UACR, maleness was significant for increased eGFR, and declining systolic blood pressure for increase in potassium level. CONCLUSION: ACE-I and ARB have a similar effect on UACR and blood potassium level, but ARB slightly increased eGFR compared to ACE-I within three months of consumption.","Puspita FM, Yunir E, Agustina PS, Sauriasari R",Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes,2021,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
22451182,Efficacy and safety of pioglitazone in type 2 diabetes mellitus: a postmarketing observational study.,"AIM: to assess the effectiveness and safety profile of pioglitazone in Indonesian type 2 diabetic patients. METHODS: type 2 diabetic patients, naive or under oral antidiabetics, with uncontrolled fasting (FBG) or postprandial blood glucose (PPBG) were enrolled from September 2009 to December 2010 from 23 cities in Indonesia. Pioglitazone (Actos(R)) 15 mg or 30 mg daily was prescribed by the physician and performed observation for 12 weeks. Body weight (BW), body mass index (BMI), FBG and PPBG were measured every 4 weeks and serum transaminase (SGPT) was measured at the beginning and at the end of the study. Changes from baseline to each visit were analyzed using Wilcoxon-test. RESULTS: 190 patients (92 male and 98 female) aged 56.3 (28-80) years were included. Mean FBG decreased from 191.8 mg/dL at baseline to 155.9; 141.0; and 127.3 mg/dL, at week 4, 8, and 12, respectively (p<0.001). Mean PPBG decreased from 267.3 mg/dL at baseline to 209.7; 188.2; and 174.9 at week 4, 8, and 12, respectively (p<0.001). BW slightly increased from 67.3 (range: 40-98) kg at baseline to 67.7 (42.0-98.5) and 67.8 (43.0-99.0) kg at weeks 8 and 12, respectively (p<0.001) and BMI increased from 25.6 (16.2-38.6) kg/m2 at baseline to 25.7 (17.0-36.3) and 25.7 (17.4-36.6) kg/m2 at weeks 8 and 12, respectively (p<0.001). SGPT values were not significantly changed (35.6U/L at baseline and 35.5U/L at week 12, p=0.93). CONCLUSION: Pioglitazone is effective in controlling blood glucose, without harmful effect on the liver. However, there was a slight but statistically significant increase in body weight, that mandates the precaution when using this drug in patients with heart failure or other conditions with water retention.",Nafrialdi,Acta Med Indones,2012 Jan,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
39561687,Trends and disability-attributable risk factors of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Southeast Asia (1990-2019): An in-depth 30-year analysis from the Global Burden of Disease study.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To provide insight on targeted approach to mitigate diabetes burden, this research aims to analyze the trends of prevalence, mortality, and disability attributable to risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) from 1990 to 2019 in the Southeast Asia (SEA) region. METHODS AND RESULTS: Age-standardized rates for prevalence (ASPR), mortality (ASMR), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) from 1990 to 2019 from the Global Burden of Disease Study were assessed. DALYs-related risk factors were estimated using multivariate regression analysis and estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was calculated to quantify the temporal trends. Over 30 years, the SEA region experienced a 59.5 % rise in T2DM ASPR, 17.33 % in ASMR, and 26.97 % in DALYs. The T2DM DALYs rate per 100,000 population was 1002.91 (885.23-1132.40) in 1990 and 1273.42 (1103.92-1452.41) in 2019, increasing by 27 %. Cambodia and Indonesia had the highest worsening in three parameters, while most significant improvement in all parameters was observed in Singapore. The curvilinear association was demonstrated between ASMR and DALYs to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. Prominent risk factors affecting DALYs increase were high fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (p < 0.001), high body mass index (BMI) (p < 0.001), tobacco use (p = 0.012), and household pollution (p = 0.03). Men were more affected than women. CONCLUSION: The burden of T2DM in the SEA region has increased significantly during the 30-year period. Policymakers should address high BMI, high FPG, smoking, and air pollution to regulate T2DM burden in SEA.","Nugrahani ASD, Muharram FR, Novida H, Swannjo JB, Wibisono S, Wungu CDK",Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,2025 Jan,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
34958178,Prevalence and risk factors of fatigue in type 1 and type 2 diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"PURPOSE: This meta-analysis was conducted to determine the prevalence and risk factors of fatigue in type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). METHODS: Observational studies reporting the prevalence and risk factors of fatigue in type 1 or 2 DM were systematically searched for in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL Plus, Cochrane Trial, and ProQuest Dissertation and Theses databases. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers. A random-effect model was used for data analysis. FINDINGS: We included 19 studies involving 7131 patients with type 1 DM and 32 studies involving 34,994 patients with type 2 DM in the study. The pooled prevalence of fatigue in type 1 and type 2 DM was 44% and 50%, respectively. The Asia-Pacific region (e.g., Japan and Australia), South America, and Africa lacked reports regarding fatigue prevalence in type 1 DM, and North Asia and Southeast Asia lacked reports of fatigue prevalence in type 2 DM. Depression and physical activity were the only two variables significantly correlated with fatigue in both type 1 and type 2 DM (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately half of the patients with type 1 or type 2 DM experienced fatigue, with the prevalence of 44% and 50%, respectively. Our findings regarding its risk factors can provide an evidence-based approach for managing fatigue in DM patients. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This meta-analysis emphasizes the importance of fatigue management in patients with type 1 and type 2 DM. Most significantly, our results on risk factors related to fatigue in diabetes can contribute to the development of evidence-based strategies for managing fatigue in individuals with DM.","Romadlon DS, Hasan F, Wiratama BS, Chiu HY",J Nurs Scholarsh,2022 Sep,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
34527220,"Early detection of macrovascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus in Medan, North Sumatera, Indonesia: A cross-sectional study.","Background: Macrovascular complications occur very frequently in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with a high mortality rate, due to the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), such as stroke, atherosclerosis acceleration, and atrial fibrillation. T2DM is a significant risk factor for CVD and has become the leading cause of death. The purpose of this study was to detect the early risk of macrovascular complications by using the ankle brachial index (ABI) as a marker. Methods: This study was an analytic study with a cross-sectional approach. The study population was patients with T2DM from several primary health care centers in Medan. In total, 89 subjects who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited with consecutive sampling. ABI was determined as the ratio of systolic blood pressure in the brachial artery to the posterior tibial artery after the subjects had been relaxed and felt comfortable in a supine position. Examination of vitamin D and lipid profile was derived from examination of venous blood.  Data were processed using SPSS and analyzed with one-way ANOVA. Results: The study found that there was a relationship between LDL-C, triglyceride, and vitamin D (25OH-D) based on the ABI (p > 0.05). Conclusions: ABI can be used for an early detection of macrovascular complications. Apart from being easy to perform, ABI was non-invasive. Some other risk factors that can also be used to assess complications and have relationships with ABI were LDL-C, triglyceride, and vitamin D (25OH-D). Complications in T2DM patients can be prevented with reasonable blood sugar control and lifestyle changes. Education and motivation need to be given to patients so that they become more independent in controlling their disease and improving their quality of life.","Amelia R, Harahap J, Yunanda Y, Wijaya H, Fujiati II, Yamamoto Z",F1000Res,2021,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
34214372,Analysis of HMGB-1 level before and after providing atorvastatin standard therapy in coronary artery disease patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus compared to without type-2 diabetes mellitus.,"OBJECTIVES: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the main causes of death from cardiovascular disease, because heart attacks result in atherosclerosis which causes narrowing of the arteries. Atorvastatin has a pleiotropic effect as anti-inflammatory through one of the target levels of High Mobility Group Box-1 (HMGB-1). This prospective observational study aimed to analyze the effect of atorvastatin on serum HMGB-1 levels in CAD. METHODS: Samples were collected from prospective observation pre-post study in May-July 2018 with consecutive sampling method. Serum HMGB-1 levels were measured in patients with CAD who were given atorvastatin for CAD with type-2 diabetes mellitus compared without type-2 diabetes mellitus in a patient ward. Blood was collected on admission day and before the patient left the hospital. After centrifugation, serum samples were stored at -80  degrees C before measurement. We used an ELISA kit (IBL International) to determine HMGB-1 concentrations. This research protocol has been approved by the Ethical Committee of Dr. Soetomo General Hospital, Surabaya. RESULTS: We enrolled 38 patients and divided them into two groups which 19 patients on CAD with type-2 diabetes mellitus and 19 patients without diabetes mellitus. Serum HMGB-1 levels in CAD with type-2 diabetes mellitus were increased significantly (p = 0.049) and not significantly decreased in CAD without type-2 diabetes mellitus (p = 0.480). The HMGB-1 level was not significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.210). CONCLUSIONS: HMGB-1 levels after providing atorvastatin in CAD with type-2 diabetes mellitus increased significantly, meanwhile, in CAD without type-2 diabetes mellitus did not decrease significantly. The HMGB-1 level was not significantly different between the two groups. Longer time and more point for the collected sample needed for further research.","Handayani W, Suharjono, Yogiarto M",J Basic Clin Physiol Pharmacol,2021 Jun 25,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
36624712,Early Recognition of Type 2 Diabetes Complications and Use of SGLT2i in Multidisciplinary Approach: Indonesian Perspective - An Expert Opinion.,"Indonesia ranks seventh with the highest number of cases of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). T2DM is associated with major undesirable complications including cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease. Kidneys play a major role in maintaining glucose homeostasis, leading the development of sodium glucose transporter inhibitors (SGLT2i). These inhibitors block renal sodium and glucose reabsorption. Several cardiovascular trials proved that SGLT2i have cardioprotective and renoprotective roles and have been suggested  as a drug of choice in primary and secondary prevention and management of cardiorenal complications associated with T2DM. This review highlights the need for a multidisciplinary recommendation for T2DM management in Indonesian population. Additionally, it is vital to provide the perspective of Indonesian medical experts in terms of screening, diagnosis and treatment as the outcome differs geographically. An expert panel of 6 members from Indonesia was convened to review the existing literature and develop an expert-based review/ summary on this topic. Members were chosen for their proficiency in diabetes, kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. The experts opined that the early use of SGLT2i will be effective in preventing and minimising the progression of cardiorenal complications. Moreover, a consistent multidimensional approach is necessary for improved outcomes.","Lydia A, Suastika K, Martosuwignjo P, Sibarani RP, Nasution SA, Sulistijo SA",Acta Med Indones,2022 Oct,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia

36453508,"""Phardiacare"" Program for Improved Medication Adherence and Clinical Outcomes of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients in Community Health Centers.","BACKGROUND: The role of pharmacists in middle-income countries such as Indonesia is still not optimal. In this study, we developed a program called ""Phardiacare"", a specific pharmacist-led program for Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the application of the ""Phardiacare"" program in improving medication adherence and clinical outcomes in T2DM patients. METHODS: The study was quasi-experimental, with a pretest-posttest design, and was conducted prospectively from July to October 2019 at the Matraman and Jatinegara District Health Center, Jakarta, Indonesia. The study comprised 33 T2DM patients in an intervention group (IG) who received the ""Phardiacare"" program and 33 patients in a control group (CG). Assessment was performed of HbA1c, FBG, LDL, HDL, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood pressure. RESULTS: HbA1c after intervention in the IG was lower than that of the CG (p <0.05). Intra-group mean differences showed improvement in the clinical parameters of FBG, triglycerides, and diastolic blood pressure in the IG (p <0.05), but not in the CG. Other clinical parameters did not show significant improvement. The results of the multivariate analysis showed that the ""Phardiacare"" program had a 16 times greater effect in reducing levels of HbA1c in the IG [95% CI 3.995:67.113, p <0.001] compared to the CG, even after controlling for confounding variables. CONCLUSION: The ""Phardiacare"" program was effective in improving patient medication adherence by decreasing HbA1c and FBG, but it did not have a significant effect on LDL, HDL, total cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure. Therefore, the implementation of Phardiacare program in the management of chronic diseases, especially T2DM, should be considered.","Pradhyta FP, Sartika RAD, Sauriasari R",Curr Diabetes Rev,2023,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
33472499,The Impact of the Indonesian Chronic Disease Management Program (PROLANIS) on Metabolic Control and Renal Function of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients in Primary Care Setting.,"BACKGROUND: Indonesia through its government National Health Insurance System has launched a non-communicable and chronic disease management program named Indonesian Chronic Disease Management Program (PROLANIS), with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension as the main focus. However, study that evaluates the clinical impact of PROLANIS in patients with T2DM is still scarce to this date. This study aims to evaluate the metabolic control and renal function of PROLANIS participants with T2DM every six month within the first 18-months of implementation. METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort study conducted at Wates sub-district, East Java using secondary data from PROLANIS group report from April 2018 to October 2019. The study population was T2DM patients who voluntarily joined the PROLANIS group in April 2018. The six-month-evaluation included metabolic parameters [body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, hemoglobin A1C, total cholesterol, high-density lipid, low-density lipid, and triglyceride (TG)] and renal parameters [blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine serum, and urinary microalbumin]. Paired t-test and wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for the analysis, and the P-value was adjusted using Bonferroni correction. A P-value < .0015 was considered statistically significant, while a P-value between .0015 and .003 was considered as marginally significant. RESULTS: A total of 30 participants were included in the analysis. Following the PROLANIS implementation, the only parameter of metabolic control that showed significant improvement was TG serum level (P < .001). Despite the worsening status of other metabolic parameters, the changes were not statistically significant except for BMI that was marginally significant (P = .002). From renal function, only BUN serum level was significantly deteriorated (P < .001), while the others did not significantly change. CONCLUSION: PROLANIS implementation in our study population seems to be ineffective. Future study with more primary healthcare centers needs to be done to scrutinize the clinical impact of this program nationwide.","Alkaff FF, Illavi F, Salamah S, Setiyawati W, Ramadhani R, Purwantini E, Tahapary DL",J Prim Care Community Health,2021 Jan-Dec,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
34113445,Effect of Garcinia mangostana pericarp extract on glial NF-kappaB levels and expression of serum inflammation markers in an obese-type 2 diabetes mellitus animal model.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an age-related disease associated with cerebral inflammation and Alzheimer's disease. Garcinia mangostana pericarp (GMP) possesses antihyperglycemic, antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory effects. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of GMP extract on cerebral inflammation in Wistar rats with T2DM by examining the expression levels of glial nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). A total of 36 8-10-week-old male Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups and provided a standard diet (normal control; C1), high-fat diet (HFD) with 200 g/kg GMP extract BW/day (GMP control; C2), HFD with streptozotocin-nicotinamide (diabetic control; C3), and HFD with 100 (M1), 200 (M2) or 400 g/kg body weight (BW)/day (M3) GMP extract for Wistar rats with diabetes. GMP extract was administered for 8 weeks after induction of T2DM was confirmed. Glial NF-kappaB activity was assessed by immunohistochemical staining, and by measuring IL-6 levels, TNF-alpha levels and SOD activity in the serum using ELISA. BW significantly increased following HFD treatment. After 7 weeks, the BW remained significantly higher compared with the normal control and GMP extract-treated groups, but decreased continuously in the T2DM groups. Glial NF-kappaB immunoreaction in the hippocampal region was significantly higher in the diabetic Wistar rats compared with the normal control Wistar rats, and 200 g/kg BW/day GMP significantly reduced its activity. The T2DM Wistar rats showed significantly higher expression levels of serum IL-6 and TNF-alpha and lower activity of SOD compared with the normal control Wistar rats. Meanwhile, rats in GMP groups M1, M2 and M3 exhibited significant reductions in the levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha expression, and increases in SOD activity. GMP extract treatment effectively reduced hippocampal NF-kappaB, IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels and increased antioxidant SOD activity. These results suggest that GMP extract prevents cerebral inflammation in T2DM Wistar rats.","Muniroh M, Nindita Y, Karlowee V, Purwoko Y, Rahmah ND, Widyowati R, Suryono S",Biomed Rep,2021 Jul,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia

This systematic review and meta-analysis compared cardiovascular and mortality outcomes in type 2 diabetes patients receiving dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4is) plus metformin versus sulfonylureas (SUs) plus metformin as add-on therapy. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Google Scholar, and Scopus were searched through January 1, 2025, for studies comparing DPP-4is plus metformin versus SUs plus metformin in type 2 diabetes patients. Outcomes of interest were major adverse cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q test and I2 statistic. Publication bias was evaluated with Begg's and Egger's tests. Study quality was assessed with the Jadad scale (for randomized controlled trials) and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (for observational studies). RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies (2012-2024), encompassing 1,505,821 participants, were included in the analysis. Major adverse cardiovascular events were reported in 21 studies, and all-cause mortality data were available from 19 studies. Meta-analysis revealed a significantly lower risk of both major adverse cardiovascular events (risk ratio [RR]: 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.73-0.84; p < 0.001) and all-cause mortality (RR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.71-0.88; p < 0.001) in patients with diabetes treated with DPP-4 inhibitors plus metformin compared to those treated with SUs plus metformin. No publication bias was detected. CONCLUSION: In type 2 diabetes patients treated with metformin, adding a DPP-4is is associated with significantly lower risks of major adverse cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality compared to adding an SUs. These findings underscore the potential cardiovascular benefits of DPP-4is and their role in improving patient outcomes.","Hasan R, Chugaeva UY, Mohammadian M, Zamanifard S, Mohammadian-Hafshejani A",PLoS One,2025,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
35598233,Absence of Association Between Serum Mutant p53 with HbA1c and Insulin in Brain Tumor Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"AIMS: This study aims to determine the prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in primary Brain Tumor (BT) subjects and assess the relationship between serum mutant p53 serum and HbA1c and insulin. BACKGROUND: T2DM is known to increase the risk of various types of cancer, which are thought to be caused by hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and inflammation. A cohort study that looked at more than 500,000 subjects with DM over 11 years showed an increased risk of different types of cancer, including brain tumors. However, several recent studies have shown the opposite. One of the important pathways in the pathogenesis of brain tumors is the p53 pathway, in which mutations in the TP53 gene can cause brain cell growth abnormalities. OBJECTIVE: The first stage involved taking subject data for the period January 2017-November 2020 from the medical records of the RSUPN Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital Indonesia to assess the prevalence of T2DM in BT subjects. The second stage was an observational study with a crosssectional design that collected primary data on subjects (n=86) to assess the relationship between serum mutant p53 serum and HbA1c and insulin. METHODS: The analysis of serum mutant p53 serum and insulin was made using the ELISA method, while measurement of HbA1c was made using the boronate affinity method. RESULT: The results show the prevalence of T2DM in BT subjects at Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital Indonesia was relatively low (9%). Serum mutant p53 levels in T2DM (1.53 ng/mL +/- 0.60) were significantly higher than in BT+T2DM and BT (P < 0.001). The HbA1c value was significantly lower in BT (5.15% +/- 0.44) compared to BT+T2DM and T2DM (P < 0.001), while T2DM insulin levels (39.54 IU/mL +/- 19.1) were significantly higher than BT+T2DM and BT (P < 0.001). There was no correlation between serum mutant p53 levels and HbA1c and insulin in the three groups. CONCLUSION: The study concludes that the prevalence of BT with T2DM is relatively low (9%) and that serum levels of mutant p53 in T2DM subjects are higher than in subjects with BT, but there is no correlation between serum mutant p53 levels and HbA1c and insulin values. Further research needs to be conducted by analyzing p53 mutants from other specimens, such as brain tumor tissue.","Syarif H, Sauriasari R, Takhwifa F, Aninditha T",Curr Diabetes Rev,2023,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia

36578884,Detection of Hemostasis Abnormalities in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Using Thromboelastography.,"INTRODUCTION: Type 2 DM (T2DM) is associated with inflammation and vascular dysfunction which impact hemostasis. Thromboelastography (TEG) as a hemostasis assessment method, is not routinely applied in T2DM. We aimed to detect hemostasis abnormalities by using the TEG method in association with glycemic levels and type of therapy among T2DM patients. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study was conducted among T2DM patients attending the Endocrinology Clinic of Saiful Anwar Hospital, Indonesia. Glycemic profiles were determined using fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose (2hPPG), and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Therapy for T2DM was classified into insulin and non-insulin regimens. The primary and secondary hemostasis profile were examined using TEG and was classified as hypo- hyper- and normo-coagulable states. RESULT: A total of 57 T2DM patients were included. Kruskal-Wallis test did not reveal a significant association between glycemic profiles and groups of hemostasis. However, the median HbA1c was higher in the hypercoagulable group of primary hemostasis and fibrinolysis. The median FPG and 2hPPG were higher in the normo-coagulable group of secondary hemostasis. Logistic regression did not indicate a significant association between type of therapy for diabetes and hemostasis profile. CONCLUSION: This study did not find significant associations between glycemic levels and type of DM therapy with hemostasis profiles using the TEG method in patients with T2DM.","Arsana PM, Firani NK, Fatonah S, Waafi AK, Novitasari AD",J ASEAN Fed Endocr Soc,2022,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
40196377,Interplay Between Insulin Resistance and Immune Dysregulation in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Implications for Therapeutic Interventions.,"Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a rapidly growing global health issue characterized by insulin resistance and chronic inflammation. Beyond regulating glucose homeostasis, insulin plays a pivotal role in modulating immune cell function, linking metabolic dysregulation with immune responses. This review examines the intricate relationship between insulin resistance and immune dysfunction in T2DM, focusing on how impaired insulin signaling pathways, particularly PI3K/Akt and MAPK, contribute to immune cell activation, proliferation, and chronic inflammation. Insulin resistance impacts immune cells such as T cells, B cells, macrophages, and neutrophils, leading to an imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses. Elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (eg, TNF-alpha, IL-6) and adipokines (eg, leptin, resistin) exacerbate insulin resistance, promoting a vicious cycle of metabolic and immune dysregulation. This interplay contributes to the chronic low-grade inflammation that underlies T2DM pathogenesis, further impairing insulin signaling and glucose metabolism. Restoration of insulin sensitivity is, therefore, a critical step toward correcting immune imbalance in insulin-resistant states like T2DM. Therapeutic approaches that reduce inflammation could also support improvements in insulin sensitivity, addressing both metabolic and immune disturbances simultaneously. The review also explores therapeutic strategies, including insulin therapy, targeting insulin signaling pathways, and lifestyle interventions. Insulin therapy can reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine production and enhance anti-inflammatory responses, although challenges such as potential immune suppression and hyperinsulinemia remain. Targeting key signaling pathways and transcription factors offers promising avenues for modulating immune responses, while lifestyle interventions, such as dietary modifications, physical activity, and weight management, can improve insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammation. By understanding the dual role of insulin in regulating both metabolic and immune functions, this review underscores the importance of addressing immune dysfunction as part of comprehensive T2DM management. Targeting the interconnected pathways of insulin signaling and immune regulation could lead to more effective therapeutic approaches, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing disease complications.","Berbudi A, Khairani S, Tjahjadi AI",Immunotargets Ther,2025,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
29348381,Thyroid Dysfunction in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients.,"BACKGROUND: thyroid dysfunction is more likely to occur in diabetes mellitus patients than general population. Until now, no study has been done to find prevalence of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism in Indonesian diabetics. This study aimed to find the proportion and characteristics of thyroid dysfunction in Indonesian type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. METHODS: a cross-sectional study was conducted in Endocrine and Diabetes Polyclinic, Department of Internal Medicine, Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital from July to September 2015. This study include type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, age >/= 18 year-old, willing to undergo thyroid laboratory testing. In this study, hypothyroidism defined as TSH more than 4.0 mIU/L, while hyperthyroidism is defined as TSH less than 0.4 mIU/L with eCLIA. RESULTS: from 364 subjects who were recruited from Endocrine and Diabetes Polyclinic, Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, 303 subjects underwent this study until analysis. Two hundred and three (273) subjects (90.1%) were euthyroid, 7 subjects (2.31%) were hyperthyroid, and 23 subjects (7.59%) were hypothyroid. Majority of the patients had subclinical hypothyroidism (56.5% based on Zulewski and Billewicz Score and 65.2% based on fT4 laboratory result), while 42.9% and 71.4% subjects had clinical hyperthyroidism based on clinical appearance and fT4 laboratory result respectively. CONCLUSION: proportion of hypothyroidism was 7.59% and hyperthyroidism was 2.31%, while the proportion of total thyroid dysfunction was 9.9% among diabetics. It is suggested that screening for thyroid dyscfunction can be done in high risk condition as a part of comprehensive management in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.","Subekti I, Pramono LA, Dewiasty E, Harbuwono DS",Acta Med Indones,2017 Oct,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
29732994,Towards Standardized Stem Cell Therapy in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review.,"OBJECTIVE: To compile and analyze the published studies on cell therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to obtain a better insight into management of T2DM that involved stem cell therapy. METHODS: We searched all published studies in Pubmed/Medline, and Cochrane library, using keywords: 'stem cell' AND 'therapy' AND 'diabetes type 2'. Inclusion criteria: original articles on the use of stem cells in humans with T2DM. Exclusion criteria: articles in the non-English literature, studies on T2DM complications that did not assess both adverse events and any of the common diabetes study outcomes. Data collection: type of study, number of cases, and all data that were related to outcome and adverse events. Data were analyzed descriptively to conclude the possible cause of adverse reactions, and which protocols gave a satisfactory outcome. RESULTS: We collected 25 original articles, out of which 17 studies did not have controls and were classified as case reports, while there were 8 studies that were controlled clinical trials. Most studies used autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) or autologous or allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from various sources. Adverse events were mild and mostly intervention related. Efficacy of autologous BM-MNCs that were given via interventional route was comparable to Wharton jelly or umbilical cord MSCs that were given via intravenous (IV), Intra muscular (IM), or subcutaneous (SC) route. CONCLUSION: Further controlled studies that compare BM-MNCs to BM-MSCs or WJ-MSCs or UCSCs are recommended to prove their comparable efficacy. In addition, studies that compare various routes of administration (IV, IM or SC) versus the more invasive interventional routes are needed.","Pawitan JA, Yang Z, Wu YN, Lee EH",Curr Stem Cell Res Ther,2018,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia

This study aimed to determine the relationships among foot care knowledge, illness perception, local beliefs, and foot care behaviors in people with T2DM in Indonesia. METHODS: Cross-sectional study with a convenience sampling technique was used to recruit 200 people with T2DM from the Outpatient Department of Islamic Hospital. The Foot Care Knowledge, Brief Illness Perception, Local Beliefs, and Foot Self-Care Behavior questionnaires were administered. RESULTS: The predictors of foot care were having a family member or friend with diabetic foot ulcer ( p = .001), diabetes mellitus duration ( p = .026), foot care knowledge ( p < .001), consequences ( p < .001), treatment control ( p < .001), and local beliefs ( p = .017).

This study also discusses the correlation between IL-1B and IL-6- type cytokine expression in renal. METHODS: Thirty Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into three main groups; those are negative control group (NC), Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus group (T2DM) given high fat diet (HFD) with streptozotocin intraperitoneal injection (35mg/kg BW) and diabetes mellitus + darapladib group (DM + DP). Each group was treated within two serial treatment time: 8 weeks and 16 weeks. Expressions of IL-1B and IL-6- type cytokine in renal were the markers that we measured by immunofluorosense method. RESULTS: The administration of darapladib can significantly decrease the expression of IL-1B- type cytokine (p ANOVA = 0.029, p < 0.005) measured in rats' renal both at weeks 8 and 16 in the T2DM group. The Expression of IL-6- type cytokine also showed a significant difference after treated with darapladib both at weeks 8 and 16 in T2DM group with p-value of ANOVA = 0.033, p < 0.005. The Pearson correlation showed a strong correlation (linear regression value was r(2) = 0.743). CONCLUSION: Our results show that atherosclerosis caused by inflammation in renal T2DM SD rats could be inhibited by the administration of darapladib.","Wihastuti TA, Aini FN, Tjahjono CT, Sulfia YH, Sholichah Z, Heriansyah T",Vasc Health Risk Manag,2019,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
32781787,Secondhand Smoke Correlates with Elevated Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio and Has a Synergistic Effect with Physical Inactivity on Increasing Susceptibility to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Community-Based Case Control Study.,"Secondhand smoke (SHS) and physical inactivity are thought to be associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but the synergistic effect of SHS with physical inactivity and their relationships with T2DM-associated inflammation biomarkers have not been estimated. We investigated the roles of SHS exposure and physical inactivity and their synergistic effect on T2DM risk and their relationships with T2DM associated inflammation biomarkers, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and white blood cells (WBCs). A case-control study was conducted in total 588 participants (294 case T2DM and 294 healthy controls) from five community clinics in Indonesia. Participants completed a standardized questionnaire on demographic information, smoking status, physical activity habits and food consumption. WBCs and NLR levels were determined using an automated hematology analyzer. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were analyzed using multiple logistic regression model. The synergistic effect was analyzed using additive interaction for logistic regression. Physical inactive people exposed to SHS exhibited a synergistically increased 7.78-fold risk of T2DM compared with people who were not exposed to SHS and who were physically active. SHS is significantly correlated with a high NLR, WBCs and has a synergistic effect with physical inactivity on increasing susceptibility to T2DM.","Rias YA, Gordon CJ, Niu SF, Wiratama BS, Chang CW, Tsai HT",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2020 Aug 6,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
32425577,Impact of Low Interferon-gamma and IL-10 Levels on TNF-alpha and IL-6 Production by PHA-Induced PBMCs in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"PURPOSE: In this study, we analyzed the production of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We aimed to investigate the capacity of monocytes to produce tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) following IFN-gamma stimulation and the associated role of IL-10 in TNF-alpha and IL-6 production. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In vitro experiments were conducted on PBMCs obtained from 19 patients with T2DM and 17 healthy participants. PBMCs were isolated from venous blood by density gradient centrifugation, followed by 3-day phytohemagglutinin induction. In vitro production of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IFN-gamma, and IL-10 was measured using the multiplex immunoassay. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS 23 version. RESULTS: IFN-gamma concentration in the T2DM group was significantly lower than that in control group (T2DM 7,700.86 +/- 3,037.77 vs control 10,672.69 +/- 5,625.50 pg/mL; p = 0.048). However, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-10 levels showed no significant difference between the two groups. The TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma and IL-6/IFN-gamma ratios were significantly higher in T2DM than in the control group (p = 0.026 and p = 0.048, respectively). In T2DM, the high TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma ratio was consistent, with the low baseline IL-10 level (p = 0.022). CONCLUSION: In T2DM, T﻿-cell response is impaired with significantly reduced IFN-gamma production, and simultaneously, circulatory monocytes show enhanced cellular responsiveness to inflammatory stimuli. The low baseline IL-10 level likely contributes to such an immune response.","Kartika R, Purnamasari D, Pradipta S, Larasati RA, Wibowo H",J Inflamm Res,2020,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
33343199,"Altered Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase Production and Its Association to Inflammatory Cytokines in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells Culture of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.","AIM: To analyze indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) production in the cell culture supernatant of phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from type 2 DM (T2DM) patients and investigate IDO's association to pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: PBMC samples were collected from 21 T2DM patients and 17 normoglycemic participants, then stimulated with PHA for 3 days. Cytokine and IDO concentrations were measured in the PBMC culture supernatants. In vitro production of TNF-alpha, IL-6, interferon-gamma, and IL-10 were measured using multiplex immunoassay. IDO concentration was assessed using ELISA. To assess how PHA stimulation altered IDO production and to minimize the unstimulated baseline effect of T2DM, we subtracted the PHA-stimulated IDO concentration from the unstimulated one. IBM SPSS version 23 was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The IDO concentrations in the PBMC culture supernatants were significantly higher in T2DM patients regardless of whether they were unstimulated (P < .001) or PHA-stimulated (P = .012). Reduced IDO production was observed in 52.8% of T2DM patients and was associated with older age and lower interferon-gamma levels. Conversely, 42.8% of T2DM patients showed increased IDO concentrations, which were correlated with the IL-6/IL-10 ratio (r = 0.683, P = .021) and interferon-gamma/IL-10 ratio (r = 0.517, P = .077). CONCLUSION: The interferon-gamma level was reduced in the PBMC culture supernatant of T2DM patients with reduced IDO production. Reduced IDO production in T2DM patients following PHA stimulation was associated with older age and, notably, higher baseline IDO concentrations. Since IDO is primarily produced by dendritic cells, reduced IDO production after PHA stimulation may indicate dendritic cell dysfunction.","Kartika R, Wibowo H, Purnamasari D, Pradipta S, Larasati RA",Int J Tryptophan Res,2020,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
40121696,The correlation of caloric intake from sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) risk in Indonesia.,"Among the concerning commercial practices are those related to sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), which offer little nutritional value and contribute to energy-dense diets. Excessive SSB consumption is associated with obesity, a major risk factor for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), particularly Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). The rise in SSB consumption in Indonesia, driven by commercial factors, increases the risk of T2DM and related health burdens. This study aims to investigate SSB consumption patterns, caloric intake, and socio-demographic characteristics affecting T2DM prevalence, using probit regression estimates based on National Socioeconomic Survey (SUSENAS) 2018 and Basic Health Research (Riskesdas) 2018. The sample size comprises 699,959 individuals, with the unit of analysis focused on individual health outcomes. Our descriptive result implies that 76.49 % incurred expenses on at least one type of SSB in the past week. Ready-to-drink beverages were the most frequently consumed, while factory-produced liquid milk had the lowest average consumption. Probit regression analysis indicated that higher SSB caloric consumption significantly increased the probability of a T2DM diagnosis. This study underscores the need for targeted interventions to reduce SSB consumption and address T2DM risk factors, especially among higher-income households and specific regions.","Ahsan A, Djutaharta T, Utami MG, Ayuning Pertiwi YB, Diniary A, Amalia N, Solarin SA, Ramanathan S",Soc Sci Med,2025 May,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia

We aim to evaluate the treatment adherence of Indonesian type 2 DM patients using national ""big data"" and investigate its association with glycemic parameters. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed baseline and fourth-year data sets from 2011 to 2018 obtained from the Indonesian Ministry of Health Cohort Study of Non-Communicable Disease Risk Factors in Bogor, West Java (the PTM Bogor Cohort Study). This was a retrospective cohort study in which the sample was divided into two groups. One group adhered to treatment from primary health centers and followed the prescribed medicine/treatment regimen (treated group), while the other did not follow the treatment (untreated group). We evaluated changes in fasting blood glucose (FBG) and post-prandial blood glucose (PPBG) by controlling for other variables. RESULTS: From 5690 subjects, 593 were type 2 DM diagnosed and 342 were eligible at the baseline. At 4-year observation, 212 eligible patients remained, consisting of 62 subjects who adhered to treatment, and more than double that number who were untreated (150 subjects). More significant decreases in FBG and PPBG were found in the treated group (FBG 80.6%, PPBG 90.3%) than in the untreated group (FBG 42.0%, PPBG 67.3%). The results of the multivariate analysis showed that after 4 years observation, treated patients have reduced FBG 3.304 times more and PPBG 3.064 times more than untreated patients, with control factors such as decrease in LDL levels and use of oral drugs. CONCLUSION: There were less than half as many treated patients as untreated patients involved in the PTM Bogor Study Group. At the fourth-year follow-up, treated patients experienced three times more significant decreases in FBG and PPBG than those who were untreated, even after being controlled by several confounding factors. Given the importance of these findings, it is suggested that immediate strategic action be taken to improve Indonesian patients' adherence to treatment.","Kaaffah S, Soewondo P, Riyadina W, Renaldi FS, Sauriasari R",Patient Prefer Adherence,2021,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia

The aim of this study is to assess the process and effects of implementing a low-cost, targeted and tailored pharmacist intervention among patients with type 2 diabetes who are non-adherent to antihypertensive drugs in a real-world primary care Indonesian setting. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A cluster randomised controlled trial with a 3-month follow-up will be conducted in 10 community health centres (CHCs) in Indonesia. Type 2 diabetes patients aged 18 years and older who reported non-adherence to antihypertensive drugs according to the Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS) are eligible to participate. Patients in CHCs randomised to the intervention group will receive a tailored intervention based on their personal adherence barriers. Interventions may include reminders, habit-based strategies, family support, counselling to educate and motivate patients, and strategies to address other drug-related problems. Interventions will be provided at baseline and at a 1-month follow-up. Simple question-based flowcharts and an innovative adherence intervention wheel are provided to support the pharmacy staff. Patients in CHCs randomised to the control group will receive usual care based on the Indonesian guideline. The primary outcome is the between-group difference in medication adherence change from baseline to 3-month follow-up assessed by MARS. Secondary outcomes include changes in patients' blood pressure, their medication beliefs assessed by the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ)-specific, as well as process characteristics of the intervention programme from a pharmacist and patient perspective.

The complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), especially vestibular dysfunction (VD), could decrease balance performance and falls-efficacy (FE) which consequently impacts social participation and quality of life (QoL). PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare balance performance, FE, social participation and QoL between individuals with T2DM with and without VD. METHODS: The participants comprised 161 T2DM with VD and 161 without VD. Three clinical tests used for confirming VD included the Head Impulse Test (HIT), the Dix Hallpike Test (DHT) and the Supine Roll Test (SRT). The scores of static and dynamic balances, FE, social participation and QoL were compared between groups. RESULTS: The balance performance, FE, social participation and QoL were lower in the group with VD. The number of patients who had severe social restriction was higher in T2DM with VD than without VD (58.4% vs 48.4%). Moreover, all domains of QoL (physical, psychological, social relationships and environmental) were lower in T2DM with VD than without VD. CONCLUSION: The presence of VD in T2DM patients was associated with decreased physical balance performances and increased social and QoL disengagement. Comprehensive management related to balance and FE, as well as the monitoring to support social participation and QoL, should be emphasized in patients with T2DM with VD.","Komalasari DR, Vongsirinavarat M, Hiengkaew V, Nualnim N",PeerJ,2024,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus AND Indonesia
28689664,"Global, regional, and national disease burden estimates of acute lower respiratory infections due to respiratory syncytial virus in young children in 2015: a systematic review and modelling study.","BACKGROUND: We have previously estimated that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was associated with 22% of all episodes of (severe) acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) resulting in 55 000 to 199 000 deaths in children younger than 5 years in 2005. In the past 5 years, major research activity on RSV has yielded substantial new data from developing countries. With a considerably expanded dataset from a large international collaboration, we aimed to estimate the global incidence, hospital admission rate, and mortality from RSV-ALRI episodes in young children in 2015. METHODS: We estimated the incidence and hospital admission rate of RSV-associated ALRI (RSV-ALRI) in children younger than 5 years stratified by age and World Bank income regions from a systematic review of studies published between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2016, and unpublished data from 76 high quality population-based studies. We estimated the RSV-ALRI incidence for 132 developing countries using a risk factor-based model and 2015 population estimates. We estimated the in-hospital RSV-ALRI mortality by combining in-hospital case fatality ratios with hospital admission estimates from hospital-based (published and unpublished) studies. We also estimated overall RSV-ALRI mortality by identifying studies reporting monthly data for ALRI mortality in the community and RSV activity. FINDINGS: We estimated that globally in 2015, 33.1 million (uncertainty range [UR] 21.6-50.3) episodes of RSV-ALRI, resulted in about 3.2 million (2.7-3.8) hospital admissions, and 59 600 (48 000-74 500) in-hospital deaths in children younger than 5 years. In children younger than 6 months, 1.4 million (UR 1.2-1.7) hospital admissions, and 27 300 (UR 20 700-36 200) in-hospital deaths were due to RSV-ALRI. We also estimated that the overall RSV-ALRI mortality could be as high as 118 200 (UR 94 600-149 400). Incidence and mortality varied substantially from year to year in any given population. INTERPRETATION: Globally, RSV is a common cause of childhood ALRI and a major cause of hospital admissions in young children, resulting in a substantial burden on health-care services. About 45% of hospital admissions and in-hospital deaths due to RSV-ALRI occur in children younger than 6 months. An effective maternal RSV vaccine or monoclonal antibody could have a substantial effect on disease burden in this age group.

33744057,Determinants of Acute Respiratory Infection Among Children Under-Five Years in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory infection (ARI) among children under five years has been identified as a risk factor for child morbidity, leading to child mortality in Indonesia. Many factors may cause ARI; however, determinants associated with ARI remain unclear in Indonesia. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to analyze the determinants of ARI among children aged under five years in Indonesia. METHODS: This study was cross-sectional and utilized secondary data from the 2017 Indonesian Demographic and Health Survey (IDHS). A total of 15,993 children under five years old were selected as respondents. Chi-squared test and binary logistic regression were used to examine the determinants of ARI among children under five years in Indonesia. RESULTS: Children aged 1 year [Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.04-1.97], children aged 2 years [OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.12-2.11], mother's occupation [OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.01-2.154], poorest wealth index [OR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.26-2.89], poor [OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.01-2.21], region of residence: Western Indonesia [OR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.28-2.00], Middle of Indonesia [OR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.44-3.33] were significantly associated with ARI among children under five years in Indonesia. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that the determinants of ARI among children under five years in Indonesia remain related to the socio-demographic aspect. This research highlighted that the family's and the living area's wealth index remains essential in improving children's health outcomes. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Our findings support increasing awareness of the low-income family through adequate information and health promotion.

32666619,"Etiologies of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and misdiagnosis of influenza in Indonesia, 2013-2016.","BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) accounts for a large burden of illness in Indonesia. However, epidemiology of SARI in tertiary hospitals in Indonesia is unknown. This study sought to assess the burden, clinical characteristics, and etiologies of SARI and concordance of clinical diagnosis with confirmed etiology. METHODS: Data and samples were collected from subjects presenting with SARI as part of the acute febrile Illness requiring hospitalization study (AFIRE). In tertiary hospitals, clinical diagnosis was ascertained from chart review. Samples were analyzed to determine the ""true"" etiology of SARI at hospitals and Indonesia Research Partnership on Infectious Diseases (INA-RESPOND) laboratory. Distribution and characteristics of SARI by true etiology and accuracy of clinical diagnosis were assessed. RESULTS: Four hundred and twenty of 1464 AFIRE subjects presented with SARI; etiology was identified in 242 (57.6%), including 121 (28.8%) viruses and bacteria associated with systemic infections, 70 (16.7%) respiratory bacteria and viruses other than influenza virus, and 51 (12.1%) influenza virus cases. None of these influenza patients were accurately diagnosed as having influenza during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza was misdiagnosed among all patients presenting with SARI to Indonesian tertiary hospitals in the AFIRE study. Diagnostic approaches and empiric management should be guided by known epidemiology. Public health strategies to address the high burden of influenza should include broad implementation of SARI screening, vaccination programs, clinician education and awareness campaigns, improved diagnostic capacity, and support for effective point-of-care tests.","Aman AT, Wibawa T, Kosasih H, Asdie RH, Safitri I, Intansari US, Mawarti Y, Sudarmono P, Arif M, Puspitasari D, Alisjahbana B, Parwati KTM, Gasem MH, Lokida D, Lukman N, Hartono TS, Mardian Y, Liang CJ, Siddiqui S, Karyana M, Lau CY",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,2021 Jan,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia

Some patients with COVID-19 develop severe clinical manifestations, while others show mild symptoms, suggesting that dysregulation of the host immune response contributes to disease progression and severity. In this review, we have summarized and discussed recent immunological studies focusing on the response of the host immune system and the immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as immunotherapeutic strategies for COVID-19. Immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2, functional exhaustion of lymphocytes, and cytokine storm have been discussed as part of immunopathology mechanisms in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Some potential immunotherapeutic strategies to control the progression of COVID-19, such as passive antibody therapy and use of interferon alphabeta and IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) inhibitor, have also been discussed. This may help us to understand the immune status of patients with COVID-19, particularly those with severe clinical presentation, and form a basis for further immunotherapeutic investigations.","Keam S, Megawati D, Patel SK, Tiwari R, Dhama K, Harapan H",Rev Med Virol,2020 Sep,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
32077450,European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps 2020.,"The European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps 2020 is the update of similar evidence based position papers published in 2005 and 2007 and 2012. The core objective of the EPOS2020 guideline is to provide revised, up-to-date and clear evidence-based recommendations and integrated care pathways in ARS and CRS. EPOS2020 provides an update on the literature published and studies undertaken in the eight years since the EPOS2012 position paper was published and addresses areas not extensively covered in EPOS2012 such as paediatric CRS and sinus surgery. EPOS2020 also involves new stakeholders, including pharmacists and patients, and addresses new target users who have become more involved in the management and treatment of rhinosinusitis since the publication of the last EPOS document, including pharmacists, nurses, specialised care givers and indeed patients themselves, who employ increasing self-management of their condition using over the counter treatments. The document provides suggestions for future research in this area and offers updated guidance for definitions and outcome measurements in research in different settings. EPOS2020 contains chapters on definitions and classification where we have defined a large number of terms and indicated preferred terms. A new classification of CRS into primary and secondary CRS and further division into localized and diffuse disease, based on anatomic distribution is proposed. There are extensive chapters on epidemiology and predisposing factors, inflammatory mechanisms, (differential) diagnosis of facial pain, allergic rhinitis, genetics, cystic fibrosis, aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease, immunodeficiencies, allergic fungal rhinosinusitis and the relationship between upper and lower airways. The chapters on paediatric acute and chronic rhinosinusitis are totally rewritten. All available evidence for the management of acute rhinosinusitis and chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps in adults and children is systematically reviewed and integrated care pathways based on the evidence are proposed. Despite considerable increases in the amount of quality publications in recent years, a large number of practical clinical questions remain. It was agreed that the best way to address these was to conduct a Delphi exercise . The results have been integrated into the respective sections. Last but not least, advice for patients and pharmacists and a new list of research needs are included.

33755666,The incidence of acute respiratory infection in Indonesian infants and association with vitamin D deficiency.,"BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with acute respiratory infection (ARI) in early life, but this has not been evaluated in Indonesia. We aimed to determine the incidence of ARI in Indonesian infants, and to evaluate the association with vitamin D deficiency. METHODS: From 23 December 2015 to 31 December 2017, we conducted a community-based prospective cohort study in Yogyakarta province. We enrolled 422 pregnant women and followed their infants from birth until 12 months of age for ARI episodes. Vitamin D status was measured at birth and at age six months. We performed Cox proportional hazard regression analysis to evaluate the association between vitamin D deficiency and pneumonia incidence. RESULTS: At study completion, 95% (400/422) of infants retained with a total of 412 child years of observation (CYO). The incidence of all ARI and of WHO-defined pneumonia was 3.89 (95% CI 3.70-4.08) and 0.25 (95% CI 0.21-0.30) episodes per CYO respectively. Vitamin D deficiency at birth was common (90%, 308/344) and associated with more frequent episodes of ARI non-pneumonia (adjusted odds ratio 4.48, 95% CI:1.04-19.34). Vitamin D status at birth or six months was not associated with subsequent pneumonia incidence, but greater maternal sun exposure during pregnancy was associated with a trend to less frequent ARI and pneumonia in infants. CONCLUSION: ARI, pneumonia, and vitamin D deficiency at birth were common in Indonesian infants. Minimising vitamin D deficiency at birth such as by supplementation of mothers or safe sun exposure during pregnancy has the potential to reduce ARI incidence in infants in this setting.","Oktaria V, Danchin M, Triasih R, Soenarto Y, Bines JE, Ponsonby AL, Clarke MW, Graham SM",PLoS One,2021,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
34939251,Practical management of suspected hypersensitivity reactions to anti-tuberculosis drugs.,"Tuberculosis (TB) is the commonest cause of death by a single infectious agent globally and ranks amongst the top ten causes of global mortality. The incidence of TB is highest in Low-Middle Income countries (LMICs). Prompt institution of, and compliance with, therapy are cornerstones for a favourable outcome in TB and to mitigate the risk of multiple drug resistant (MDR)-TB, which is challenging to treat. There is some evidence that adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) to anti-TB drugs occur in over 60% and 3%-4% of patients respectively. Both ADRs and HSRs represent significant barriers to treatment adherence and are recognised risk factors for MDR-TB. HSRs to anti-TB drugs are usually cutaneous and benign, occur within few weeks after commencement of therapy and are likely to be T-cell mediated. Severe and systemic T-cell mediated HSRs and IgE mediated anaphylaxis to anti-TB drugs are relatively rare, but important to recognise and treat promptly. T-cell-mediated HSRs are more frequent amongst patients with co-existing HIV infection. Some patients develop multiple sensitisation to anti-TB drugs. Whilst skin tests, patch tests and in vitro diagnostics have been used in the investigation of HSRs to anti-TB drugs, their predictive value is not established, they are onerous, require specialist input of an allergist and are resource-dependent. This is compounded by the global, unmet demand for allergy specialists, particularly in low-income countries (LICs)/LMICs and now the challenging circumstances of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. This narrative review provides a critical analysis of the limited published evidence on this topic and proposes a cautious and pragmatic approach to optimise and standardise the management of HSRs to anti-TB drugs. This includes clinical risk stratification and a dual strategy involving sequential re-challenge and rapid drug desensitisation. Furthermore, a concerted international effort is needed to generate real-time data on ADRs, HSRs, safety and clinical outcomes of these interventions.","Bermingham WH, Bhogal R, Arudi Nagarajan S, Mutlu L, El-Shabrawy RM, Madhan R, Krishnaswamy UM, Murali MR, Kudagammana ST, Shrestha R, Sumantri S, Christopher DJ, Mahesh PA, Dedicoat M, Krishna MT",Clin Exp Allergy,2022 Mar,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
37287203,Associations Between Indoor Air Pollutants and Risk Factors for Acute Respiratory Infection Symptoms in Children Under 5: An Analysis of Data From the Indonesia Demographic Health Survey.,"OBJECTIVES: The study investigated the association between indoor air pollution (IAP) and risk factors for acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms in children under 5 years of age. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using data derived from Indonesia Demographic and Health Survey in 2017. Binary logistic regression modeling was employed to examine each predictor variable associated with ARI among children under 5 years of age in Indonesia. RESULTS: The study included a total of 4936 households with children. Among children under 5 years old, 7.2% reported ARI symptoms. The presence of ARI symptoms was significantly associated with the type of residence, wealth index, and father's smoking frequency, which were considered the sample's socio-demographic characteristics. In the final model, living in rural areas, having a high wealth index, the father's smoking frequency, and a low education level were all linked to ARI symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed that households in rural areas had a substantially higher level of reported ARI symptoms among children under 5 years old. Furthermore, the father's smoking frequency and low education level were associated with ARI symptoms.","Santri IN, Wardani Y, Phiri YVA, Nyam G, Putri TA, Isni K, Suryani D, Sambo G",J Prev Med Public Health,2023 May,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia

Conclusions: In conclusion, stunting is related to the frequency and duration of diarrheal diseases and ARI, therefore, community- integrated health center need to carryout counseling activities on children less than five years to determine their health status.","Arini D, Nursalam N, Mahmudah M, Faradilah I",J Public Health Res,2020 Jul 3,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
38719213,Zinc for prevention and treatment of the common cold.,"BACKGROUND: The common cold is an acute, self-limiting viral respiratory illness. Symptoms include nasal congestion and mucus discharge, sneezing, sore throat, cough, and general malaise. Given the frequency of colds, they are a public health burden and a significant cause of lost work productivity and school absenteeism. There are no established interventions to prevent colds or shorten their duration. However, zinc supplements are commonly recommended and taken for this purpose. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of zinc for the prevention and treatment of the common cold. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and LILACS to 22 May 2023, and searched Web of Science Core Collection and two trials registries to 14 June 2023. We also used reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children or adults that tested any form of zinc against placebo to prevent or treat the common cold or upper respiratory infection (URTI). We excluded zinc interventions in which zinc was combined with other minerals, vitamins, or herbs (e.g. a multivitamin, or mineral supplement containing zinc). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess risks of bias, and GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We independently extracted data. When necessary, we contacted study authors for additional information. We assessed zinc (type and route) with placebo in the prevention and treatment of the common cold. Primary outcomes included the proportion of participants developing colds (for analyses of prevention trials only), duration of cold (measured in days from start to resolution of the cold), adverse events potentially due to zinc supplements (e.g. unpleasant taste, loss of smell, vomiting, stomach cramps, and diarrhoea), and adverse events considered to be potential complications of the common cold (e.g. respiratory bacterial infections). MAIN RESULTS: We included 34 studies (15 prevention, 19 treatment) involving 8526 participants. Twenty-two studies were conducted on adults and 12 studies were conducted on children. Most trials were conducted in the USA (n = 18), followed by India, Indonesia, Iran, and Turkey (two studies each), and Australia, Burkina Faso, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, Tanzania, Thailand, and the UK (one study each). The 15 prevention studies identified the condition as either common cold (n = 8) or URTI (n = 7). However, almost all therapeutic studies (17/19) focused on the common cold. Most studies (17/34) evaluated the effectiveness of zinc administered as lozenges (3 prevention; 14 treatment) in acetate, gluconate, and orotate forms; gluconate lozenges were the most common (9/17). Zinc gluconate was given at doses between 45 and 276 mg/day for between 4.5 and 21 days. Five (5/17) lozenge studies gave acetate lozenges and two (2/17) gave both acetate and gluconate lozenges. One (1/17) lozenge study administered intranasal (gluconate) and lozenge (orotate) zinc in tandem for cold treatment. Of the 17/34 studies that did not use lozenges, 1/17 gave capsules, 3/17 administered dissolved powders, 5/17 gave tablets, 4/17 used syrups, and 4/17 used intranasal administration. Most studies were at unclear or high risk of bias in at least one domain. There may be little or no reduction in the risk of developing a cold with zinc compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.01; I(2) = 20%; 9 studies, 1449 participants; low-certainty evidence). There may be little or no reduction in the mean number of colds that occur over five to 18 months of follow-up (mean difference (MD) -0.90, 95% CI -1.93 to 0.12; I(2) = 96%; 2 studies, 1284 participants; low-certainty evidence). When colds occur, there is probably little or no difference in the duration of colds in days (MD -0.63, 95% CI -1.29 to 0.04; I(2) = 77%; 3 studies, 740 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and there may be little or no difference in global symptom severity (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.04, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.43; I(2) = 0%; 2 studies, 101 participants; low-certainty evidence). When zinc is used for cold treatment, there may be a reduction in the mean duration of the cold in days (MD -2.37, 95% CI -4.21 to -0.53; I(2) = 97%; 8 studies, 972 participants; low-certainty evidence), although it is uncertain whether there is a reduction in the risk of having an ongoing cold at the end of follow-up (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.27; I(2) = 65%; 5 studies, 357 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or global symptom severity (SMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.50; I(2) = 78%; 2 studies, 261 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and there may be little or no difference in the risk of a change in global symptom severity (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.23; 1 study, 114 participants; low-certainty evidence). Thirty-one studies reported non-serious adverse events (2422 participants). It is uncertain whether there is a difference in the risk of adverse events with zinc used for cold prevention (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.47; I(2) = 0%; 7 studies, 1517 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or an increase in the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.78 to 3.57; I(2) = 0%; 3 studies, 1563 participants; low-certainty evidence). There is probably an increase in the risk of non-serious adverse events when zinc is used for cold treatment (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.55; I(2) = 44%; 2084 participants, 16 studies; moderate-certainty evidence); no treatment study provided information on serious adverse events. No study provided clear information about adverse events considered to be potential complications of the common cold. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that zinc supplementation may have little or no effect on the prevention of colds but may reduce the duration of ongoing colds, with an increase in non-serious adverse events. Overall, there was wide variation in interventions (including concomitant therapy) and outcomes across the studies, as well as incomplete reporting of several domains, which should be considered when making conclusions about the efficacy of zinc for the common cold.","Nault D, Machingo TA, Shipper AG, Antiporta DA, Hamel C, Nourouzpour S, Konstantinidis M, Phillips E, Lipski EA, Wieland LS",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,2024 May 9,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
35342776,"Multilevel Analysis of Lifestyle and Household Environment for Toddlers With Symptoms of Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) in Indonesia in 2007, 2012, and 2017.","Introduction. The morbidity and mortality rate of Acute Respiratory Tract Infection (ARI) in children under 5 is relatively high in Indonesia. Socio-demographic characteristic is considered one of the factors causing ARI in Indonesia. However, no study analyzed the prevalence of ARI among toddlers and the differences among the determinant factors in multiple periods. Thus, this study aimed to analyze the prevalence trends and determinant factors associated with ARI symptoms in children under 5 in Indonesia in 2007, 2012, and 2017. Methods. This study analyzed cross-sectional survey data from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in Indonesia during 2007, 2012, and 2017. Bivariate and multivariate analysis with logistic regression was performed using Stata version 15. The final results were expressed in Adjusted Odds Ratio (AORs) and 95% Confidence Interval (CI). Results. The findings showed a progress in prevalence trends with a decrease in the percentage of children with ARI symptoms from 11.25% (2007), then 5.12% (2012) to 4.22% (2017). Risk factors for toddlers experiencing ARI symptoms were as follows: younger maternal age (OR: 1.13, 95% Cl 0.70-1.81 in 2007, OR: 1.72, 95% Cl 1.03-2.88 in 2012 and OR: 0.98, 95% Cl 0.48-1.97 in 2017), smoking habits of family members (OR: 1.12, 95% Cl 0.85-1.48 in 2012, OR: 1.23, 95% Cl in 2017), poor drinking water quality (OR: 1.12, 95% Cl 0.85-1.48 in 2012 and OR: 1.23, 95% Cl in 2017), unavailable toilet facilities (OR: 1.27, 95% Cl 1.04-1.56 in 2007, OR: 1.24, 95% Cl 0.95-1.63 in 2012 and OR: 1.28, 95% Cl 0.97-1.68 in 2017). Conclusion. There was a decrease in the prevalence of ARI symptoms among children in 2007, 2012, and 2017, with no prominent differences in other related factors. The lifestyle and household environmental factors such as the use of dirty fuel, the presence of smokers in the household, the poor quality of drinking water, unavailable toilet facilities in addition to the maternal age and child age were the determinant factors that must be prioritized and improved. Family self-awareness should also be enhanced for better prospects for toddler survival.","Lutpiatina L, Sulistyorini L, Notobroto HB, Raya RP, Utama RD, Thuraidah A",Glob Pediatr Health,2022,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
36361461,"Gendered Impact of Age, Toilet Facilities, and Cooking Fuels on the Occurrence of Acute Respiratory Infections in Toddlers in Indonesia and the Philippines.","INTRODUCTION: The purpose of the study was to analyze the risk factors of acute respiratory infections (ARI) in children under five in Indonesia and the Philippines and to implement a primary review of the characteristics of toddlers and their households in both countries. METHODS: Data were obtained from the 2017 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) of Indonesia and the Philippines. The characteristics of children, mothers, and households were analyzed using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression to examine the significant correlations between variables. RESULTS: The percentage of children under five with ARI symptoms in 2017 was 1.51% in the Philippines and 4.22% in Indonesia. In Indonesia, males aged under one year had significantly lower occurrences of ARI symptoms (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.36-0.82). In the Philippines, dirty cooking fuels had a significant effect on increasing the likelihood of ARI in female toddlers (OR 4.01, 95% CI 1.02-15.83). In the Philippines, the unavailability of toilet facilities had a significant effect on increasing the likelihood of ARI in male toddlers (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.15-6.16). CONCLUSION: The comparison of risk factors between male and female toddlers revealed different results in some variables, as follows: children aged under one year, dirty cooking fuels, and unavailable toilet facilities. The role of parents is fundamental in taking care of female toddlers, since they are more exposed to ARI at the age of under one year and are more prone to indoor air pollution from solid cooking fuels.","Sulistyorini L, Li CY, Lutpiatina L, Utama RD, Nurlailah",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2022 Nov 7,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia

The aims of this study were to analyze the antibiotic use and factors affected to the quality of antibiotic use in PHCC in Banjarbaru City, South Kalimantan, Indonesia. METHODS: The study was conducted in four PHCCs, two in urban and two in rural areas. All of the patients visited these PHCCs since March to April 2018 were recruited as samples after signing informed consent. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 18. RESULTS: There were no significant difference in antibiotic use between urban and rural PHCC, both on ARTI nonpneumonia and nonspecific diarrhea. The most prescribed antibiotics were amoxycillin and cephadroxil. Based on DDD/1,000 patients-day calculation, the quantity of antibiotics in urban PHCC was 3,544.4 and in rural PHCC was 3,478.6. Physicians with more than seven years of service, both in rural and urban PHCCs, were prescribe the antibiotics higher than who had been working for shorter period. There were no significant difference between physicians who had trained on rational drug use and had not trained yet in urban PHCC (p=0.874), while in rural PHCC there were a significant difference among them. CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative analysis showed that the antibiotics use in DDD in urban PHCC was 3,544.416 and in rural PHCC was 3,478.693. Factors affected to the quality of antibiotic use were physician's years of service and rational drug use training's.","Wardani RL, Suharjono, Kuntaman, Widjaja A",J Basic Clin Physiol Pharmacol,2021 Jun 25,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
35638033,The role of exclusive breastfeeding on sIgA and lactoferrin levels in toddlers suffering from Acute Respiratory Infection: A cross-sectional study.,"Secretion of Immunoglobulin A (sIgA) and lactoferrin is a nutrient content in breast milk that can increase immunity in preventing infectious diseases such as Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI). This research aims to determine the role of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) on sIgA and Lactoferrin levels in toddlers suffering from ARI. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 124 toddlers under five from January-July 2021. Toddlers were selected using a purposive technique sampling from three Community Health Centers in Central Jakarta. Data were analyzed using t-test and ANOVA. The history of immunization, EBF, and frequency of ARI was significantly associated with levels of sIgA and lactoferrin. Parity only correlated with sIgA but not with lactoferrin levels. Maternal and toddlers' age, gender, and nutritional status were not significantly related to sIgA and lactoferrin levels. There is a significant (p-value <0.001) difference in the mean protein sIgA and lactoferrin levels in toddlers who were given EBF with ARI frequency <2 times and toddlers who were given EBF with ARI frequency >/=2 times. Toddlers who were exclusively breastfed with ARI frequency <2 times had higher levels of sIgA and lactoferrin (188901.77 pg/ml and 262.32 ng/ml, respectively) compared to infants given EBF with ARI frequency >/=2 times (136683.47 pg/ml and 181.49 ng/ml, respectively). History of immunization was also significantly (p-value <0.05) associated with levels of sIgA and lactoferrin in infants with ARI. The content of sIgA and lactoferrin in breast milk and immunization can increase the body's immune system in toddlers suffering from ARI.","Fatimah, Massi MN, Febriani ADB, Hatta M, Karuniawati A, Rauf S, Wahyuni S, Hamid F, Alasiry E, Patellongi I, Permatasari TAE, Farsida",Ann Med Surg (Lond),2022 May,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia

As new knowledge regarding treatment options for COVID-19 has emerged, the use of ozone therapy in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection as an integrative therapeutic option supplementary to standard treatment regimen has been assessed in the present literature. We reviewed, critically analyzed, and summarized all present published literature on ozone therapy in association with COVID-19 via the PubMed database. Various reports and studies on the use of ozone (major autohemotherapy, rectal ozone insufflation, ozone inhalation) in patients affected by COVID-19 indicate that ozone therapy may reduce morbidity and accelerate recovery, while exhibiting a high safety profile with no relevant adverse effects. Current literature suggests that integrating ozone therapy into the existing standard of care and best available therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 patients offers major advantages in terms of superior clinical outcome parameters and amelioration of laboratory results. Further prospective studies are warranted to guide the next steps in the clinical application of ozone therapy and examine its impact on the course of COVID-19.","Harapan BN, Harapan T",Med Gas Res,2023 Oct-Dec,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia

METHOD: We searched PubMed databases for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2, Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus. Full texts were retrieved, analyzed and developed into an easy-to-understand review. RESULTS: We provide a complete review related to structure, origin, and how the body responds to this virus infection and explain the possibility of an immune system over-reaction or cytokine storm. We also include an explanation of how this virus creates modes of avoidance to evade immune system attacks. We further explain the therapeutic approaches that can be taken in the treatment and prevention of this viral infection. CONCLUSION: In summary, based on the structural and immune-evasion system of coronavirus, we suggest several approaches to treat the disease.","Astuti I, Ysrafil",Diabetes Metab Syndr,2020 Jul-Aug,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
32974585,"Identification of viral etiology of acute respiratory tract infections in children and adults in Tabanan, Bali, Indonesia.","Acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) is the most common infectious disease in humans worldwide. The morbidity and mortality rates are high, especially in developing countries from Southeast Asia and Africa. While ARTI is commonly associated with viruses, there is limited data on the spectrum of viruses causing ARTI in developing countries, including Indonesia. This study was based on utilizing molecular techniques targeting a panel of 11 endemic and emerging respiratory viral pathogens including zoonotic viruses in a cohort of children and adults presenting at Tabanan General Hospital, Bali, with acute respiratory illness, from January to November 2017. In total, 98 out of 200 samples (49.0 %) tested positive for viruses. Our study confirmed 64.3 % viral etiology in children and 12.2 % in adults. Viruses that were detected were Herpesviridae (15.0 %) followed by enteroviruses (12.0 %), influenza A virus (11.5 %), respiratory syncytial virus (8.0 %), Adenoviridae (6.5 %), human metapneumovirus (3.5 %), Paramyxoviridae (2.0 %), bocavirus (1.0 %) and Coronaviridae (0.5 %). The study sheds light on the viral spectrum of ARTI in children and adults in Tabanan, Bali, Indonesia.","Widhidewi NW, Wiyatno A, Dewantari AK, Paramasatiari L, Aryastuti SA, Artika IN, Setiawan WD, Soebandrio A, Aye Myint KS, Safari D",Access Microbiol,2020,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
33621713,Maternal and perinatal outcomes in high compared to low risk pregnancies complicated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection (phase 2): the World Association of Perinatal Medicine working group on coronavirus disease 2019.,"BACKGROUND: It has still to be ascertained whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in pregnancy is associated with worse maternal and fetal outcomes compared to low risk gestations. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate maternal and perinatal outcomes in high- and low-risk pregnancies complicated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. STUDY DESIGN: This was a multinational retrospective cohort study involving women with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection from 76 centers from 25 countries in Europe, the United States, South America, Asia, and Australia from April 4, 2020, to October 28, 2020. The primary outcome was a composite measure of maternal mortality and morbidity, including admission to the intensive care unit, use of mechanical ventilation, or death. The secondary outcome was a composite measure of adverse perinatal outcome, including miscarriage, fetal loss, neonatal and perinatal death, and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. All outcomes were assessed in high- and low-risk pregnancies. Pregnancies were considered high risk in case of either preexisting chronic medical conditions in pregnancy or obstetrical disorders occurring in pregnancy. The Fisher exact test and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: A total of 887 singleton pregnancies who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens were included in the study. The risk of composite adverse maternal outcomes was higher in high-risk pregnancies than in low-risk pregnancies (odds ratio, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-2.24; P=.035). In addition, women carrying high-risk pregnancies were at higher risk of hospital admission (odds ratio, 1.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-2.04; P=.002), presence of severe respiratory symptoms (odds ratio, 2.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.41-3.21; P=.001), admission to the intensive care unit (odds ratio, 2.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.42-4.88), and invasive mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, 2.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-5.94; P=.002). When exploring perinatal outcomes, high-risk pregnancies were at high risk of adverse perinatal outcomes (odds ratio, 1.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.15-2.72; P=.009). However, such association was mainly because of the higher incidence of miscarriage in high-risk pregnancies compared with that in low-risk pregnancies (5.3% vs 1.6%, P=.008); furthermore, there was no difference in other explored outcomes between the 2 study groups. At logistic regression analysis, maternal age (odds ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.22; P=.023) and high-risk pregnancy (odds ratio, 4.21; 95% confidence interval, 3.90-5.11; P<.001) were independently associated with adverse maternal outcomes. CONCLUSION: High-risk pregnancies complicated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were at higher risk of adverse maternal outcomes than low-risk pregnancies complicated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.","D'Antonio F, Sen C, Mascio DD, Galindo A, Villalain C, Herraiz I, Arisoy R, Ovayolu A, Eroglu H, Canales MG, Ladella S, Cojocaru L, Turan O, Turan S, Hadar E, Brzezinski-Sinai NA, Dollinger S, Uyaniklar O, Ocakouglu SR, Atak Z, Premru-Srsen T, Kornhauser-Cerar L, Druskovic M, Ples L, Gunduz R, Agacayak E, Schvartzman JA, Malbran MN, Liberati M, Sebastiano FD, Oronzi L, Cerra C, Buca D, Cagnacci A, Ramone A, Barra F, Carosso A, Benedetto C, Cosma S, Pintiaux A, Daelemans C, Costa E, Ozel A, Muhcu M, Lopez JSJ, Alvarado C, Piqueras AL, Oliva DE, Schera GBL, Volpe N, Frusca T, Samardjiski I, Simeonova S, Papestiev IA, Hojman J, Turkcuoglu I, Cromi A, Lagana AS, Ghezzi F, Sirico A, Familiari A, Scambia G, Sukhikh ZKGT, Gorina KA, de Sa RAM, Vaz M, Feuerschuette OHM, Gatta AND, Youssef A, Donna GD, Martinez-Varea A, Loscalzo G, Morales Rosello J, Stefanovic V, Nupponen I, Nelskyla K, Ayala R, Molpeceres RG, Vazquez AP, Sandri F, Cataneo I, Lenzi M, Haberal ET, Huertas E, Sanchez A, Arango P, Bermejo A, Alcantara MMG, Goynumer G, Okuyan E, Madalina C, Guisan AC, Schulte AM, Esposito V, De Robertis V, Zdjelar S, Lackovic M, Mihajlovic S, Jekova N, Saccone G, Aslan MM, Dedda MCD, Chalid M, Canache JEM, Daskalakis G, Antsaklis P, Vega EC, Cueto E, Taccaliti C, Aykanat Y, Ozlem Genc S, Froessler B, Radulova PA, Morano D, Bianchi B, Marino MGL, Meccariello G, Rohatgi B, Schiattarella A, Morlando M, Colacurci N, Villasco A, Biglia N, Marques ALS, Gatti A, Luvero D, Angioli R, Pittaro A, Lila A, Zlatohlavkova B",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,2021 Jul,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
36100904,"Respiratory support in patients with severe COVID-19 in the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection (ISARIC) COVID-19 study: a prospective, multinational, observational study.","BACKGROUND: Up to 30% of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 require advanced respiratory support, including high-flow nasal cannulas (HFNC), non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV), or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics, outcomes and risk factors for failing non-invasive respiratory support in patients treated with severe COVID-19 during the first two years of the pandemic in high-income countries (HICs) and low middle-income countries (LMICs). METHODS: This is a multinational, multicentre, prospective cohort study embedded in the ISARIC-WHO COVID-19 Clinical Characterisation Protocol. Patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who required hospital admission were recruited prospectively. Patients treated with HFNC, NIV, or IMV within the first 24 h of hospital admission were included in this study. Descriptive statistics, random forest, and logistic regression analyses were used to describe clinical characteristics and compare clinical outcomes among patients treated with the different types of advanced respiratory support. RESULTS: A total of 66,565 patients were included in this study. Overall, 82.6% of patients were treated in HIC, and 40.6% were admitted to the hospital during the first pandemic wave. During the first 24 h after hospital admission, patients in HICs were more frequently treated with HFNC (48.0%), followed by NIV (38.6%) and IMV (13.4%). In contrast, patients admitted in lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs) were less frequently treated with HFNC (16.1%) and the majority received IMV (59.1%). The failure rate of non-invasive respiratory support (i.e. HFNC or NIV) was 15.5%, of which 71.2% were from HIC and 28.8% from LMIC. The variables most strongly associated with non-invasive ventilation failure, defined as progression to IMV, were high leukocyte counts at hospital admission (OR [95%CI]; 5.86 [4.83-7.10]), treatment in an LMIC (OR [95%CI]; 2.04 [1.97-2.11]), and tachypnoea at hospital admission (OR [95%CI]; 1.16 [1.14-1.18]). Patients who failed HFNC/NIV had a higher 28-day fatality ratio (OR [95%CI]; 1.27 [1.25-1.30]). CONCLUSIONS: In the present international cohort, the most frequently used advanced respiratory support was the HFNC. However, IMV was used more often in LMIC. Higher leucocyte count, tachypnoea, and treatment in LMIC were risk factors for HFNC/NIV failure. HFNC/NIV failure was related to worse clinical outcomes, such as 28-day mortality.

38725588,"Nasopharyngeal carriage rate, serotype distribution, and antimicrobial profiles of Streptococcus pneumoniae among patients with acute respiratory tract infection in Manado, North Sulawesi, Indonesia.","We studied the carriage rate, distribution of serotype, and antimicrobial profile of Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) among patients with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI) in two primary health centres and a tertiary referral hospital from 2019 to 2020 in Manado, North Sulawesi, Indonesia before 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) introduction. A total of 106 nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from children and adult patients. Serotyping of S. pneumoniae strain was performed by sequential multiplex PCR and Quellung reaction. Antimicrobial profile was performed by the disc diffusion method. We identified thirty-one patients carried S. pneumoniae strains (29 %). The S. pneumoniae carriage rate was found to be higher among children aged 2-5 years (13/32; 40.6 %) than in children under 1 year (8/27; 29.6 %), children and adolescents under 18 years of age (5/20; 25.0 %) and adult patients (5/27; 18.5 %). The distribution of serotypes varied, including 14, 18C, 19A, 23F, 19F and 35B (two strains each) and 1, 3, 6B, 6C, 31, 9V, 15C, 16F, 17F, 23A, 35F (one strain each) and non-typeable (9/31; 29 %). We found S. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to vancomycin (30/31; 97 %), chloramphenicol (29/31; 94 %), clindamycin (29/31; 94 %), erythromycin (22/31; 71 %), azithromycin (22/31; 71 %), tetracycline (14/31; 45 %), penicillin (11/31; 35 %), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (10/31; 32 %).

35497948,Experimental and natural infections of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 in pets and wild and farm animals.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread globally and has led to extremely high mortality rates. In addition to infecting humans, this virus also has infected animals. Experimental studies and natural infections showed that dogs have a low susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas domesticated cats and other animals in the family Felidae, such as lions, tigers, snow leopards, and cougars, have a high susceptibility to viral infections. In addition, wild white-tailed deer, gorillas, and otters have been found to be infected by SARS-CoV-2. Furry farm animals, such as minks, have a high susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The virus appears to spread among minks and generate several new mutations, resulting in increased viral virulence. Furthermore, livestock animals, such as cattle, sheep, and pigs, were found to have low susceptibility to the virus, whereas chicken, ducks, turkeys, quail, and geese did not show susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This knowledge can provide insights for the development of SARS-CoV-2 mitigation strategies in animals and humans. Therefore, this review focuses on experimental (both replication and transmission) in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo studies of SARS-CoV-2 infections in pets and in wild and farm animals, and to provide details on the mechanism associated with natural infection.","Mastutik G, Rohman A, I'tishom R, Ruiz-Arrondo I, de Blas I",Vet World,2022 Mar,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia

Data were derived from the 2012 and 2017 Indonesia Demographic and Health Survey. Information from 1408 children younger than 5 years showing ARI symptoms in the past 2 weeks before the survey was analyzed using logistic regression analyses. Around 25% of children younger than 5 years with ARI symptoms did not receive medical care. The odds of receiving care increased in mothers from rich households. The odds reduced in children aged 2 or more years; children of mothers not assisted by trained delivery attendants; mothers attending none or <4 antenatal visits; mothers delivering at home, and mothers reporting that permission to visit health services was a problem. Efforts to improve care-seeking behavior are required.

25890989,Respiratory viruses and torque teno virus in adults with acute respiratory infections.,"OBJECTIVE: To define the molecular epidemiology of respiratory viral infections in adult patients. METHODS: Nasal and throat swabs were collected from all adult patients with influenza-like illness (ILI), acute respiratory infection (ARI), or severe ARI (SARI) admitted to a tertiary hospital in Surakarta, Indonesia, between March 2010 and April 2011 and analyzed for 19 respiratory viruses and for torque teno virus (TTV) and human gyrovirus (HGyV). RESULTS: Respiratory viruses were detected in 61.3% of the subjects, most of whom had ARI (90.8%, OR = 11.39), were hospitalized (96.9%, OR = 22.31), had asthma exacerbation (90.9%, OR = 8.67), and/or had pneumonia (80%, OR = 4.0). Human rhinovirus (HRV) A43 predominated. Influenza A H3N2, human metapneumovirus (HMPV) subtypes A1 and A2, the influenza B virus, human adenovirus B, and human coronavirus OC43 were also detected. All respiratory viruses were detected in the transition month between the rainy and dry seasons. No mixed respiratory virus infection was found. Coinfections of the influenza A H3N2 virus with TTV, HMPV with TTV, HRV with TTV, and human parainfluenza virus-3 with TTV were found in 4.7, 2.8, 19.8, and 0.9% of the samples, respectively.

39139094,Effects of the Local Environment and Nutritional Status on the Incidence of Acute Respiratory Infections Among Children Under 5 Years Old in Indonesia.,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to map the incidence of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) among under-5 children in Indonesia, address the triple burden of malnutrition, and analyze the impact of malnutrition on ARIs, taking into account the environmental and wealth disparities in Indonesia. METHODS: This study utilized an ecological design, analyzing aggregate data from the Indonesia Nutrition Survey, 2022. It encompassed 33 provinces and 486 districts/cities, involving a total of 334 878 children under 5 years of age. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was employed to investigate the relationships among wealth, environment, malnutrition (stunting, wasting, and underweight), and ARIs. RESULTS: The proportion of ARI cases in Indonesia was generally concentrated in central Sumatra, the western and eastern parts of Java, and eastern Papua. In contrast, the northern part of Sumatra, central Kalimantan, central Sulawesi, and central Papua had a higher proportion of malnutrition cases compared to other regions. Negative associations were found between malnutrition and ARIs (path coefficient =-0.072; p&lt;0.01) and between wealth and environment (path coefficient =-0.633; p&lt;0.001), malnutrition (path coefficient=-0.399; p&lt;0.001), and ARIs (path coefficient=-0.918; p&lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: An increasing wealth index is expected to contribute to reducing ARIs, malnutrition and environmental burdens in the future. This study emphasizes the necessity for focused strategies that address both immediate health challenges and the underlying socioeconomic determinants to improve child health outcomes in the Indonesian context.","Purnama TB, Wagatsuma K, Pane M, Saito R",J Prev Med Public Health,2024 Sep,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
39264960,"Evaluation of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for the prevention of COVID-19 (COPCOV): A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has proved ineffective in treating patients hospitalised with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), but uncertainty remains over its safety and efficacy in chemoprevention. Previous chemoprevention randomised controlled trials (RCTs) did not individually show benefit of HCQ against COVID-19 and, although meta-analysis did suggest clinical benefit, guidelines recommend against its use. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Healthy adult participants from the healthcare setting, and later from the community, were enrolled in 26 centres in 11 countries to a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial of COVID-19 chemoprevention. HCQ was evaluated in Europe and Africa, and chloroquine (CQ) was evaluated in Asia, (both base equivalent of 155 mg once daily). The primary endpoint was symptomatic COVID-19, confirmed by PCR or seroconversion during the 3-month follow-up period. The secondary and tertiary endpoints were: asymptomatic laboratory-confirmed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection; severity of COVID-19 symptoms; all-cause PCR-confirmed symptomatic acute respiratory illness (including SARS-CoV-2 infection); participant reported number of workdays lost; genetic and baseline biochemical markers associated with symptomatic COVID-19, respiratory illness and disease severity (not reported here); and health economic analyses of HCQ and CQ prophylaxis on costs and quality of life measures (not reported here). The primary and safety analyses were conducted in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Recruitment of 40,000 (20,000 HCQ arm, 20,000 CQ arm) participants was planned but was not possible because of protracted delays resulting from controversies over efficacy and adverse events with HCQ use, vaccine rollout in some countries, and other factors. Between 29 April 2020 and 10 March 2022, 4,652 participants (46% females) were enrolled (HCQ/CQ n = 2,320; placebo n = 2,332). The median (IQR) age was 29 (23 to 39) years. SARS-CoV-2 infections (symptomatic and asymptomatic) occurred in 1,071 (23%) participants. For the primary endpoint the incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 was 240/2,320 in the HCQ/CQ versus 284/2,332 in the placebo arms (risk ratio (RR) 0.85 [95% confidence interval, 0.72 to 1.00; p = 0.05]). For the secondary and tertiary outcomes asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred in 11.5% of HCQ/CQ recipients and 12.0% of placebo recipients: RR: 0.96 (95% CI, 0.82 to 1.12; p = 0.6). There were no differences in the severity of symptoms between the groups and no severe illnesses. HCQ/CQ chemoprevention was associated with fewer PCR-confirmed all-cause respiratory infections (predominantly SARS-CoV-2): RR 0.61 (95% CI, 0.42 to 0.88; p = 0.009) and fewer days lost to work because of illness: 104 days per 1,000 participants over 90 days (95% CI, 12 to 199 days; p < 0.001). The prespecified meta-analysis of all published pre-exposure RCTs indicates that HCQ/CQ prophylaxis provided a moderate protective benefit against symptomatic COVID-19: RR 0.80 (95% CI, 0.71 to 0.91). Both drugs were well tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs). Study limitations include the smaller than planned study size, the relatively low number of PCR-confirmed infections, and the lower comparative accuracy of serology endpoints (in particular, the adapted dried blood spot method) compared to the PCR endpoint. The COPCOV trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov; number NCT04303507. INTERPRETATION: In this large placebo-controlled, double-blind randomised trial, HCQ and CQ were safe and well tolerated in COVID-19 chemoprevention, and there was evidence of moderate protective benefit in a meta-analysis including this trial and similar RCTs.

35251612,Importance of gut microbiome regulation for the prevention and recovery process after SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viral infection (Review).,"Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been reported to affect organs other than the lungs, including the liver, brain, kidneys and intestine, and gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal discomfort, have also been reported. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 could potentially directly or indirectly regulate the gut microbiome profile and its homeostasis. The abundance of Coprobacillus, Clostridium ramosum and Clostridium are associated with the severity of COVID-19, and Firmicutes, Bacteriodetes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria are also related to COVID-19 infection. The four phyla are correlated with the severity of COVID-19 infection in patients. The modulation of factors that control the physiological growth of the gut microbiome will determine the proportionate ratio of microbiome types (profile). Taken together, gut microbiome profile alterations in COVID-19 patients may have a cross effect with the modulation of cytokine levels in COVID-19 infection. With these findings, several factors that regulate gut microbiome homeostasis may support the degree of the clinical symptoms and hasten the recovery process after COVID-19 infection.","Najmi N, Megantara I, Andriani L, Goenawan H, Lesmana R",Biomed Rep,2022 Apr,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia

25429685,Childhood acute respiratory infections and household environment in an Eastern Indonesian urban setting.,"This pilot study evaluated the potential effect of household environmental factors such as income, maternal characteristics, and indoor air pollution on children's respiratory status in an Eastern Indonesian community. Household data were collected from cross-sectional (n = 461 participants) and preliminary childhood case-control surveys (pneumonia cases = 31 diagnosed within three months at a local health clinic; controls = 30). Particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) was measured in living rooms, kitchens, children's bedrooms, and outside areas in close proximity once during the case-control household interviews (55 homes) and once per hour from 6 a.m. to midnight in 11 homes. The household survey showed that children were 1.98 times (p = 0.02) more likely to have coughing symptoms indicating respiratory infection, if mothers were not the primary caregivers. More children exhibited coughing if they were not exclusively breastfed (OR = 2.18; p = 0.06) or there was a possibility that their mothers were exposed to environmental tobacco smoke during pregnancy (OR = 2.05; p = 0.08). This study suggests that household incomes and mother's education have an indirect effect on childhood pneumonia and respiratory illness. The concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 ranged from 0.5 to 35.7 microg/m3 and 7.7 to 575.7 microg/m3, respectively, based on grab samples. PM was significantly different between the case and control groups (p < 0.01). The study also suggests that ambient air may dilute indoor pollution, but also introduces pollution into the home from the community environment. Effective intervention programs need to be developed that consider multiple direct and indirect risk factors to protect children.","Shibata T, Wilson JL, Watson LM, LeDuc A, Meng C, Ansariadi, La Ane R, Manyullei S, Maidin A",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2014 Nov 25,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
36795924,Respiratory perspective of COVID-19 in pregnancy.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared a global pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). By February 2022, the disease had infected more than 500 million people globally. COVID-19 frequently manifests as pneumonia and mortality is mainly caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Previous studies have reported that pregnant women are at a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and complications can happen due to alterations in the immune response, respiratory physiology, hypercoagulable state, and placental pathology. Clinicians face the challenge of selecting the proper treatment for pregnant patients with different physiological characteristics compared with the non-pregnant population. Furthermore, drug safety for both the patient and the fetus should also be considered. Efforts to prevent COVID-19, including prioritizing vaccination for pregnant women, are essential to break the chain of COVID-19 transmission in the pregnant population. This review aims to summarize the current literature regarding the effect of COVID-19 in pregnant women, its clinical manifestations, treatment, complications, and prevention.","Purwono A, Agustin H, Lisnawati Y, Faisal HKP",J Infect Dev Ctries,2023 Jan 31,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
33241081,A Qualitative Study on Family Role in the Care and Prevention of Acute Respiratory Infection Among Children in Primary Health Care.,"Background. Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) is a common reason that parents seek help to primary health care. In 2016, almost 65% (64.4%) pneumonia and less than 36% (35.6%) non-pneumonia cases were found among the children in Malang. Members of families have important roles to play in individual's health, especially the children. The aim of this study was to explore the roles of family members in the care and prevention of children with ARI. Method. This was a qualitative study, with a phenomenological approach involving 12 informants. An in-depth interview was conducted on each informant having children with recurrent ARI during a space of 3 months in the primary health care. Information collected from the interviews were transcribed and analyzed into different themes. Results. The 4 themes identified include ARI in children, parent roles, influences of family members, and family problems. Different styles of parenting were established between the fathers and mothers also between the mothers and grandmothers on preventing ARI. The behavior of other family members impact both on the risk and prevention of ARI. Some of the identified problems capable of affecting children's health include inability to control the children, unstable income and the stressed condition of most mothers. Conclusion. Behavior of family members impacts on the prevention of ARI among the children. Problems within the family could affect the mothers' or caregivers' psychology, which might in turn impact on the care given to the children infected with ARI or in preventing it.","Rakhmani AN, Arisanti N, Dhamayanti M, Wiwaha G, Mutyara K, Setiawati EP",Glob Pediatr Health,2020,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
15654405,"Respiratory syncytial virus infection: denominator-based studies in Indonesia, Mozambique, Nigeria and South Africa.","OBJECTIVE: To assess the burden of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated lower respiratory infections (LRI) in children in four developing countries. METHODS: A WHO protocol for prospective population-based surveillance of acute respiratory infections in children aged less than 5 years was used at sites in Indonesia, Mozambique, Nigeria and South Africa. RSV antigen was identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay performed on nasopharyngeal specimens from children meeting clinical case definitions. FINDINGS: Among children aged < 5 years, the incidence of RSV-associated LRI per 1000 child-years was 34 in Indonesia and 94 in Nigeria. The incidence of RSV-associated severe LRI per 1000 child-years was 5 in Mozambique, 10 in Indonesia, and 9 in South Africa. At all study sites, the majority of RSV cases occurred in infants. CONCLUSION: These studies demonstrate that RSV contributes to a substantial but quite variable burden of LRI in children aged < 5 years in four developing countries. The possible explanations for this variation include social factors, such as family size and patterns of seeking health care; the proportion of children infected by human immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV); and differences in clinical definitions used for obtaining samples. The age distribution of cases indicates the need for an RSV vaccine that can protect children early in life.","Robertson SE, Roca A, Alonso P, Simoes EA, Kartasasmita CB, Olaleye DO, Odaibo GN, Collinson M, Venter M, Zhu Y, Wright PF",Bull World Health Organ,2004 Dec,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
40016855,"Prevalence and risk factors of acute respiratory infection and diarrhea among children under 5 years old in low-middle wealth household, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory infection (ARI) and diarrhea remain critical public health concerns. In Indonesia, various interventions have been implemented to reduce the prevalence of ARIs and diarrhea among children in low- and middle-income households. Hence, the absence of detailed data on the prevalence of ARIs and diarrhea among children under five in low- and middle-income households in Indonesia restricts the formulation of targeted health interventions and policies. This study sought to evaluate the prevalence of ARI and diarrhea while examining modifiable risk factors related to malnutrition, sanitation, and social protection characteristics in Indonesia. METHODS: This study utilized a cross-sectional design based on data from the Nutrition Status Survey 2022 covering 514 districts/cities in Indonesia. It analyzed 289,631 children under five years out of 334,848 households with low and middle wealth indices. Multivariable binary logistic regression analysis was employed to calculate the risk associated with cases of ARI and diarrhea. RESULTS: The prevalence of ARI and diarrhea among low- and middle-wealth households were 5.7% and 6.0%, respectively, with infants under six months being the most vulnerable group to these infections, including malnutrition. The most significant risk factors for ARI and diarrhea are unclean cooking fuel [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.53, 95% CI 1.47-1.60] and shared toilet facilities (aOR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.38-1.51), with households using shared toilets having 1.45 times higher risk of diarrhea (aOR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.38-1.51) compared to those with private access. Additionally, households lacking social protection support are also at increased risk for these infections and malnutrition issues. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a notable prevalence of ARI and diarrhea among low- and middle-wealth households, particularly affecting infants under six months. Vulnerable children, especially those who were stunted or underweight, and households lacking sanitation and social protection faced heightened risks for these health issues.","Purnama TB, Wagatsuma K, Saito R",Infect Dis Poverty,2025 Feb 27,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
34559864,"Factors related with the incidence of acute respiratory infections in toddlers in Sleman, Yogyakarta, Indonesia: Evidence from the Sleman Health and Demographic Surveillance System.","Various factors associated with Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) in toddlers have been widely observed, but there are no studies using data from the Sleman Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS). This study aimed to determine the factors associated with ARI in children under five in Sleman, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. This research was an observational analytic study with a cross-sectional design, using secondary data from the Sleman HDSS. Data of 463 children under five who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were used in this study. Inclusion criteria were toddlers who have complete observed variable data. The variables observed were the characteristics of children under five, the attributes of the mother, the physical condition of the house, the use of mosquito coils, sanitation facilities, and sources of drinking water. The exclusion criteria were toddlers with pulmonary tuberculosis in the past year. Data analysis used chi-squared tests for bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis. The results showed that working mothers had a greater risk of ARI under five children with OR 1.46 (95% CI = 1.01-2.11), and groundwater as a water source was a protective factor against the occurrence of ARI in toddlers with OR 0.46 (95% CI = 0.26-0.81). After a logistic regression analysis was performed, only the drinking water source variable had a statistically significant relationship with the incidence of ARI in children under five with OR = 0.47 (95% CI = 0.268-0.827). Research on the relationship between water quality and the incidence of ARI in children under five is needed to follow up on these findings.","Fathmawati F, Rauf S, Indraswari BW",PLoS One,2021,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
38961765,Virological characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron EG.5.1 variant.,"In middle to late 2023, a sublineage of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron XBB, EG.5.1 (a progeny of XBB.1.9.2), is spreading rapidly around the world. We performed multiscale investigations, including phylogenetic analysis, epidemic dynamics modeling, infection experiments using pseudoviruses, clinical isolates, and recombinant viruses in cell cultures and experimental animals, and the use of human sera and antiviral compounds, to reveal the virological features of the newly emerging EG.5.1 variant. Our phylogenetic analysis and epidemic dynamics modeling suggested that two hallmark substitutions of EG.5.1, S:F456L and ORF9b:I5T are critical to its increased viral fitness. Experimental investigations on the growth kinetics, sensitivity to clinically available antivirals, fusogenicity, and pathogenicity of EG.5.1 suggested that the virological features of EG.5.1 are comparable to those of XBB.1.5. However, cryo-electron microscopy revealed structural differences between the spike proteins of EG.5.1 and XBB.1.5. We further assessed the impact of ORF9b:I5T on viral features, but it was almost negligible in our experimental setup. Our multiscale investigations provide knowledge for understanding the evolutionary traits of newly emerging pathogenic viruses, including EG.5.1, in the human population.","Tsujino S, Deguchi S, Nomai T, Padilla-Blanco M, Plianchaisuk A, Wang L, Begum MM, Uriu K, Mizuma K, Nao N, Kojima I, Tsubo T, Li J, Matsumura Y, Nagao M, Oda Y, Tsuda M, Anraku Y, Kita S, Yajima H, Sasaki-Tabata K, Guo Z, Hinay AA Jr, Yoshimatsu K, Yamamoto Y, Nagamoto T, Asakura H, Nagashima M, Sadamasu K, Yoshimura K, Nasser H, Jonathan M, Putri O, Kim Y, Chen L, Suzuki R, Tamura T, Maenaka K, Irie T, Matsuno K, Tanaka S, Ito J, Ikeda T, Takayama K, Zahradnik J, Hashiguchi T, Fukuhara T, Sato K",Microbiol Immunol,2024 Sep,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
36246568,Analysis of Adrenocorticotropic Hormone and Cortisol Levels in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome COVID-19 Patients.,"OBJECTIVE: SARS-CoV-2 infection may cause multiple organ failure. However, scarce information can be found on the impact on the endocrine system. This study was conducted to determine plasma Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and plasma cortisol levels in a cohort of COVID-19 patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted on COVID-19 patients who manifested ARDS and were admitted to the ICU of Dr. Soetomo Tertiary Hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia. Morning plasma ACTH and plasma total cortisol were measured on 45 recruited patients. The outcome of the patient was justified based on the survivance on days 7th and 30th during the follow-up with groupings of surviving for survived patients and nonsurvive for deceased patients. RESULTS: The ACTH and cortisol median were 1.06 (0.5-64.57) pg/mL and 17.61 (0.78-75) mug/dL, respectively. Both parameters were assembled to allow the allocation of the 45 subjects into the survive and nonsurvive groups. There was a moderate correlation between ACTH and cortisol levels in all groups (r = 0.46, p < 0.002) and particularly ACTH and cortisol levels in COVID-19 patients who survived on the 7th-day and 30th-day follow-up (r = 0.518 and r = 0.568, respectively, with p < 0.05). It is important to note that there was no correlation for an individual parameter, either ACTH only or cortisol only, compared to the outcome among patients with various comorbid. CONCLUSION: ACTH or cortisol alone has no correlation to the outcome of these patients. Therefore, further study of the potential use of corticosteroid treatments guided by ACTH and cortisol levels in reducing the risk of ARDS warrants further investigation.","Marpaung FR, Mayasari V, Sidjabat H, Soehita S, Semedi BP, Parwati I, Wihastuti TA, Iskandar A, Aryati",Dis Markers,2022,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
36343627,Antiviral effects of phytochemicals against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and their mechanisms of action: A review.,"The worldwide spreading of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has posed a serious threat to health, economic, environmental, and social aspects of human lives. Currently, there are no approved treatments that can effectively block the virus although several existing antimalarial and antiviral agents have been repurposed and allowed use during the pandemic under the emergency use authorization (EUA) status. This review gives an updated overview of the antiviral effects of phytochemicals including alkaloids, flavonoids, and terpenoids against the COVID-19 virus and their mechanisms of action. Search for natural lead molecules against SARS-CoV-2 has been focusing on virtual screening and in vitro studies on phytochemicals that have shown great promise against other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV. Until now, there is limited data on in vivo investigations to examine the antiviral activity of plants in SARS-CoV-2-infected animal models and the studies were performed using crude extracts. Further experimental and preclinical investigations on the in vivo effects of phytochemicals have to be performed to provide sufficient efficacy and safety data before clinical studies can be performed to develop them into COVID-19 drugs. Phytochemicals are potential sources of new chemical leads for the development of safe and potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents.","Jantan I, Arshad L, Septama AW, Haque MA, Mohamed-Hussein ZA, Govender NT",Phytother Res,2023 Mar,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
29727522,Development of a short course on management of critically ill patients with acute respiratory infection and impact on clinician knowledge in resource-limited intensive care units.,"BACKGROUND: The 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic caused surges of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) in resource-limited settings. Several Ministries of Health requested clinical management guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO), which had not previously developed guidance regarding critically ill patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess the acceptability and impact on knowledge of a short course about the management of critically ill patients with acute respiratory infections complicated by sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome delivered to clinicians in resource-limited ICUs. METHODS: Over 4 years (2009-2013), WHO led the development, piloting, implementation and preliminary evaluation of a 3-day course that emphasized patient management based on evidence-based guidelines and used interactive adult-learner teaching methodology. International content experts (n = 35) and instructional designers contributed to development. We assessed participants' satisfaction and content knowledge before and after the course. RESULTS: The course was piloted among clinicians in Trinidad and Tobago (n = 29), Indonesia (n = 38) and Vietnam (n = 86); feedback from these courses contributed to the final version. In 2013, inaugural national courses were delivered in Tajikistan (n = 28), Uzbekistan (n = 39) and Azerbaijan (n = 30). Participants rated the course highly and demonstrated increased immediate content knowledge after (vs before) course completion (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: We found that it was feasible to create and deliver a focused critical care short course to clinicians in low- and middle-income countries. Collaboration between WHO, clinical experts, instructional designers, Ministries of Health and local clinician-leaders facilitated course delivery. Future work should assess its impact on longer-term knowledge retention and on processes and outcomes of care.","Diaz JV, Ortiz JR, Lister P, Shindo N, Adhikari NKJ",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,2018 Sep,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
33932013,"Analysis of factors influencing acute respiratory infection among under-five children in Sering Public Health Centre, Medan Tembung subdistrict.","INTRODUCTION: Nowadays, acute respiratory infection (ARI) is the most common cause of high morbidity and mortality rate in children. ARI is defined as an infection either in the upper or lower respiratory tract that lasts for 14 days and caused by either viruses or bacteria. The incidence of ARI in 2017 is 20.54%, with the most prominent characteristic in children aged 1 to 4 years. Factors that affect ARI frequency are gender, birth weight, nutritional status, immunization status, vitamin A status, exclusive breastfeeding, smoke exposure, family income, and mother's formal education. AIM: This study aims to find out risk factors that potentiate ARI among children from age 1 to 5. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study used a descriptive-analytical method with a cross-sectional study approach. The data is taken by consecutive sampling method with a questionnaire as the tool. RESULTS: The bivariate analysis result using Fisher's exact test shows that there is no relation between sex (p=0.642), birth weight (p=0.683), completion of immunization (p=0.195), vitamin A supplementation (p=1.000), exclusive breastfeeding (p=0.157), crowding (p=1.000), family income (p=0.658), knowledge (p=1.000), attitude (p=0.156), and behavior (p=1.000) with the frequency of ARI. The bivariate analysis result using Kruskal-Wallis test shows that there is no significant difference between groups in each factor of smoke exposure (p=0.988) and mother's formal education (p=0.899) with the frequency of ARI. CONCLUSIONS: There is no relation between each factor with ARI frequency and there is no significant difference between groups in each factor with ARI frequency.","Salim S, Lubis LD, Adella CA, Daulay M, Megawati ER",Folia Med (Plovdiv),2021 Apr 30,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
29205865,"Estimated incidence of influenza-associated severe acute respiratory infections in Indonesia, 2013-2016.","BACKGROUND: Indonesia's hospital-based Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) surveillance system, Surveilans Infeksi Saluran Pernafasan Akut Berat Indonesia (SIBI), was established in 2013. While respiratory illnesses such as SARI pose a significant problem, there are limited incidence-based data on influenza disease burden in Indonesia. This study aimed to estimate the incidence of influenza-associated SARI in Indonesia during 2013-2016 at three existing SIBI surveillance sites. METHODS: From May 2013 to April 2016, inpatients from sentinel hospitals in three districts of Indonesia (Gunung Kidul, Balikpapan, Deli Serdang) were screened for SARI. Respiratory specimens were collected from eligible inpatients and screened for influenza viruses. Annual incidence rates were calculated using these SIBI-enrolled influenza-positive SARI cases as a numerator, with a denominator catchment population defined through hospital admission survey (HAS) to identify respiratory-coded admissions by age to hospitals in the sentinel site districts. RESULTS: From May 2013 to April 2016, there were 1527 SARI cases enrolled, of whom 1392 (91%) had specimens tested and 199 (14%) were influenza-positive. The overall estimated annual incidence of influenza-associated SARI ranged from 13 to 19 per 100 000 population. Incidence was highest in children aged 0-4 years (82-114 per 100 000 population), followed by children 5-14 years (22-36 per 100 000 population). CONCLUSIONS: Incidence rates of influenza-associated SARI in these districts indicate a substantial burden of influenza hospitalizations in young children in Indonesia. Further studies are needed to examine the influenza burden in other potential risk groups such as pregnant women and the elderly.","Susilarini NK, Haryanto E, Praptiningsih CY, Mangiri A, Kipuw N, Tarya I, Rusli R, Sumardi G, Widuri E, Sembiring MM, Noviyanti W, Widaningrum C, Lafond KE, Samaan G, Setiawaty V",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,2018 Jan,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
38690309,Infection-related mortality and infection control practices in childhood acute myeloid leukemia in a limited resource setting: Experience with the Indonesian national protocol.,"BACKGROUND: In resource-limited settings, addressing infections remains a substantial challenge in the management of children with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). In Indonesia, infection-related mortality (IRM) is thought to be high compared to high-income countries. However, there has been no previous study of infection profile and IRM in Indonesian patients with AML. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe infections and IRM in children with AML treated according to the Indonesian National AML protocol and to describe the implementation of infection control practices in resource-limited settings. METHODS: This retrospective observational study used secondary data from the medical records of pediatric patients with AML treated with the National Protocol at Dr. Sardjito Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia, from April 2012 to September 2018. Essential patient characteristics, time of IRM, and cause of death were recorded, and infection control practices were observed. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: 113 patients with AML were treated with the National protocol, and 83 met the inclusion criteria. Infections occurred in 69 (83%) patients with a total of 123 episodes (mean 1.8/patient). Death was seen in 48 (58%) patients, with 19 (23%) IRM. The majority of infections were in the gastrointestinal tract (n = 51, 30.5%), sepsis (n = 29, 17%), and respiratory tract (n = 28, 17%). Infections mostly occurred during the first induction (41%). There were 90 (73%) episodes of clinically documented infection and 33 (27%) episodes of microbiologically documented infection. The positivity rate of blood cultures was only 27%. The majority of bacteria detected were gram-negative (n = 25, 69%), and among them were Klebsiella pneumonia (19%) and Escherichia coli (19%). Candida albicans was detected in 1 (2%) culture. Suboptimal infection prevention and control were found in the clinical practice. CONCLUSION: Infections and infection-related mortality in children with AML treated using the National protocol were frequent, mainly occurring during the first induction phase. Compliance with infection prevention and control measures needs improvement. Urgent attention is required for better supportive care, including isolation rooms, antibiotics, and antifungals. The predominance of Gram-negative bacterial infections highlights the necessity for further research into effective prophylaxis. Enhanced healthcare and nursing professional vigilance and tailored antibiotic strategies are vital. Improving compliance and ensuring adequate supportive care resources are essential, emphasizing nursing's pivotal role. Further research is crucial to drive advancements in infection control strategies.","Supriyadi E, Purwanto I, Widiastuti Z, Armytasari I, Sandi S, Ardianto B, Kaspers GJL",Belitung Nurs J,2024,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
37767018,Relationship between anal swab PCR for SARS-CoV-2 with gastrointestinal clinical manifestations and severity of COVID-19 infection in Indonesia.,"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Indonesia remain high. The virus can bind with ACE2 receptor which is not only found in the lungs, but also in the digestive tract. Thus, it allows SARS-CoV-2 infection in the gastrointestinal tract, gastrointestinal manifestations, and detection of viral RNA on anal swab using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). There hasn't been similar study about the role of anal swab in Indonesia yet. Therefore, this study aims to determine the relationship between SARS-COV-2 anal swab PCR with gastrointestinal clinical manifestations, and the severity of COVID-19 in Indonesia. Methods: This is an analytical study with cross-sectional design. Samples were obtained from hospitalized COVID-19 patients from July 2020 to January 2021. Demographic data, clinical manifestations, severity, and SARS-CoV-2 anal swabs PCR were collected using case report form. Results: A total of136 patients were analyzed. 52 patients (38.2%) had positive SARS-CoV-2 anal swabs PCR and 84 patients (61.8%) had negative results. The most common gastrointestinal clinical manifestations were nausea and vomiting in 69 patients (50.7%), anorexia in 62 patients (45.6%), and abdominal pain in 31 patients (22.8%). There were 114 patients (83,8%) classified as mild-moderate symptoms and 22 patients (16,2%) classified as severe-critical symptoms. There was a statistically significant relationship between the gastrointestinal tract SARS-CoV-2 infection and gastrointestinal clinical manifestations (P=0.031). There was no statistically significant relationship between the gastrointestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection and the severity of COVID-19 infection (P = 0.844). Conclusions: This study showed there is a significant relationship between SARS-CoV-2 anal swab PCR with gastrointestinal clinical manifestations. There is no significant relationship between anal swab PCR with the severity of COVID-19 infection.","Muzellina VN, Abdullah M, Kurniawan J, Rizka A",F1000Res,2023,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia

This study aimed at determining the association between presence of chronic diseases and smoking behaviors with the development of ARDS among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. This study was carried out in 15 Muhammadiyah-'Aisyiyah-affiliated COVID-19 referral hospitals in Indonesia. Four hundred ninety participants who tested positive for the COVID-19 were recruited in this study. Demographic data, history of chronic diseases, and the development of ARDS were retrieved from hospital patient records. Information about the smoking behavior was collected after respondents were discharged from the hospital. Presence of chronic diseases such as diabetes, chronic heart disease, hypertension, and chronic liver diseases were significantly associated with the development of ARDS. In a similar regard, patients who currently smoked had a 5 times greater risk of developing ARDS compared with those who never smoked.","Rachmawati E, Listiowati E, Kurniawan DW, Suraya I, Ahsan A, Nurmansyah MI",Asia Pac J Public Health,2021 May,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
37042007,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 detection in domestic animals as a reservoir for the virus transmission to humans in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND AND AIM: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that attacks the respiratory and digestive tract. The SARS-CoV-2 showed systemic characteristics with various clinical symptoms from subclinical to fatal (causing death). Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to occur from humans to pets (cats, dogs, tigers, ferrets, and poultry). Knowledge about the role of domestic animals in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to humans, and as reservoirs of this virus needs to be investigated further. This study aimed to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in domestic animals such as dogs, cats, pigs, cows, birds, and bats that are often in contact with humans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 157 samples, which included nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, along with sera samples from domestic animals such as cats, pigs, cows, birds, and bats, were taken from Veterinary Hospitals, Veterinary Clinics, and farms around the Yogyakarta region. Detection of the virus was done using rapid detection of viral antigens, antibodies, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique. RESULTS: The results showed that 5/157 (3.1%) samples found positive against the COVID-19 virus using a rapid antibody test; however, the results were negative on the rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests. Antibody-positive samples came from animals that had a history of household COVID-19 human infection. CONCLUSION: Thus, findings of the present study conclude that there is a potential for transmission of the COVID-19 virus between animals and humans.","Kristianingrum YP, Untari T, Kusumawati A",Vet World,2023 Feb,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
37772476,"Investigations on the risk factors of Acute Respiratory Infections (ARIs) among under-five children in Depok City, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: Acute Respiratory Infections are caused by pathogens that spread rapidly. Acute Respiratory Infections include upper respiratory tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections. According to the World Health Organization (2019), Acute Respiratory Infections rank fourth among diseases that affect children with high morbidity. Indonesia's under-five mortality rate due to Acute Respiratory Infections rank first among the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Under-five mortality due to Acute Respiratory Infections in Indonesia accounts for 22.30% of the total under-five mortality cases. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted with a total of 100 mother and child pairs selected by simple random sampling. Internal and external factors, including nutritional status, maternal age, maternal education level, presence of a smoker in the house, house ownership, household size, temperature, humidity, lighting, ceilings, floors, walls, and ventilation were investigated as the risk factors of Acute Respiratory Infections among under-five children in this study. RESULTS: Our cross-sectional study found that 68 out of 100 under-five children in this study were infected with Acute Respiratory Infections during the study period. Among the risk factors, our multivariate analysis suggests that presence of smokers, maternal age, and inadequate ceiling conditions were the potential determinants of Acute Respiratory Infections among under-five children in Depok City. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limitations of this study, we believe our results could give a comprehensive overview of the risk factors of Acute Respiratory Infections in under-five children.","Wulandari RA, Fauzia S, Kurniasari F",Ann Ig,2024 Jan-Feb,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia

36109390,Guidelines for the prevention and management of children and adolescents with COVID-19.,"Children are the future of the world, but their health and future are facing great uncertainty because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In order to improve the management of children with COVID-19, an international, multidisciplinary panel of experts developed a rapid advice guideline at the beginning of the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020. After publishing the first version of the rapid advice guideline, the panel has updated the guideline by including additional stakeholders in the panel and a comprehensive search of the latest evidence. All recommendations were supported by systematic reviews and graded using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Expert judgment was used to develop good practice statements supplementary to the graded evidence-based recommendations. The updated guideline comprises nine recommendations and one good practice statement. It focuses on the key recommendations pertinent to the following issues: identification of prognostic factors for death or pediatric intensive care unit admission; the use of remdesivir, systemic glucocorticoids and antipyretics, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, and high-flow oxygen by nasal cannula or non-invasive ventilation for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure; breastfeeding; vaccination; and the management of pediatric mental health. CONCLUSION: This updated evidence-based guideline intends to provide clinicians, pediatricians, patients and other stakeholders with evidence-based recommendations for the prevention and management of COVID-19 in children and adolescents. Larger studies with longer follow-up to determine the effectiveness and safety of systemic glucocorticoids, IVIG, noninvasive ventilation, and the vaccines for COVID-19 in children and adolescents are encouraged. WHAT IS KNOWN: * Several clinical practice guidelines for children with COVID-19 have been developed, but only few of them have been recently updated. * We developed an evidence-based guideline at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak and have now updated it based on the results of a comprehensive search of the latest evidence. WHAT IS NEW: * The updated guideline provides key recommendations pertinent to the following issues: identification of prognostic factors for death or pediatric intensive care unit admission; the use of remdesivir, systemic glucocorticoids and antipyretics, intravenous immunoglobulin for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, and high-flow oxygen by nasal cannula or non-invasive ventilation for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure; breastfeeding; vaccination; and the management of pediatric mental health.","Liu E, Smyth RL, Li Q, Qaseem A, Florez ID, Mathew JL, Amer YS, Estill J, Lu Q, Fu Z, Lu X, Chan ES, Schwarze J, Wong GW, Fukuoka T, Ahn HS, Lee MS, Nurdiati D, Cao B, Tu W, Qian Y, Zhao S, Dong X, Luo X, Chen Z, Li G, Zhang X, Zhao X, Xu H, Xu F, Shi Y, Zhao R, Zhao Y, Lei J, Zheng X, Wang M, Yang S, Feng X, Wu L, He Z, Liu S, Wang Q, Song Y, Luo Z, Zhou Q, Guyatt G, Chen Y, Li Q",Eur J Pediatr,2022 Dec,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
38206905,"The impact of government pandemic policies on the vulnerability of healthcare workers to SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality in Jakarta Province, Indonesia.","INTRODUCTION: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic, putting them at a higher risk of infection and disease than non-HCWs. We analysed the effects of government policies for the public and for HCWs on the likelihood of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and mortality among HCWs during the first 8 months of the pandemic in Jakarta province, the capital city and COVID-19 hotspot in Indonesia. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using secondary data from the Jakarta provincial government from March to October 2020, which included sociodemographic characteristics, symptoms, comorbidities and COVID-19 diagnosis history for all cases. A generalized linear mixed-effect regression model was used to determine the effect of each month on the odds ratio (OR) of COVID-19 cases and deaths for HCW compared with non-HCW, assuming that monthly trends were influenced by varying government policies. RESULTS: A total of 894,487 suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases in health facilities in Jakarta province were analysed. The OR of confirmed cases for HCW was 2.04 (95% CI 2.00-2.08; p < .001) compared to non-HCW. Despite this higher OR for infection, the case fatality rate (2.32 per 100) and OR (1.02, 95% CI 0.93-1.11; p = .65) of COVID-19 deaths for HCW were similar to those of non-HCW. We observed a trend towards a lower number of COVID-19 patients in hospitals and lower odds of COVID-19 cases among HCWs during the April-to-July 2020 phase compared to the August-to-October phase. This chronologically aligned with more extensive policies to support hospital-based, community-based and well-being-related actions to protect HCW. CONCLUSIONS: HCW had higher odds of having SARS-CoV-2 infection, yet similar odds of death from COVID-19, as compared to non-HCW. Government policies with collective efforts to prevent hospital overcapacity during high transmission and burden periods of the pandemic should be prioritized.","Agustina R, Rianda D, Lamuri A, Ekawidyani KR, Siregar DAS, Sari DS, Wulan PM, Devana ND, Syam AF, Rahyussalim AJ, Handayani DO, Widyastuti W, Shankar AH, Salama N",Ann Med,2023,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
35672215,Effectiveness of prone position in acute respiratory distress syndrome and moderating factors of obesity class and treatment durations for COVID-19 patients: A meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the effectiveness of prone positioning on COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome with moderating factors in both traditional prone positioning (invasive mechanical ventilation) and awake self-prone positioning patients (non-invasive ventilation). RESEARCH METHODOLOGY: A comprehensive search was conducted in CINAHL, Cochrane library, Embase, Medline-OVID, NCBI SARS-CoV-2 Resources, ProQuest, Scopus, and Web of Science without language restrictions. All studies with prospective and experimental designs evaluating the effect of prone position patients with COVID-19 related to acute respiratory distress syndrome were included. Pooled standardised mean differences were calculated after prone position for primary (PaO(2)/FiO(2)) and secondary outcomes (SpO(2) and PaO(2)) RESULTS: A total of 15 articles were eligible and included in the final analysis. Prone position had a statistically significant effect in improving PaO(2)/FiO(2) with standardised mean difference of 1.10 (95%CI 0.60-1.59), SpO(2) with standardised mean difference of 3.39 (95% CI 1.30-5.48), and PaO(2) with standardised mean difference of 0.77 (95% CI 0.19-1.35). Patients with higher body mass index and longer duration/day are associated with larger standardised mean difference effect sizes for prone positioning. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that prone position significantly improved oxygen saturation in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome in both traditional prone positioning and awake self-prone positioning patients. Prone position should be recommended for patients with higher body mass index and longer durations to obtain the maximum effect.","Ashra F, Chen R, Kang XL, Chiang KJ, Pien LC, Jen HJ, Liu D, Hsiao SS, Chou KR",Intensive Crit Care Nurs,2022 Oct,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
37127269,COVID-19 Screening Score for Patients without Acute Respiratory Symptoms Undergoing Emergency Medical Procedures in Indonesia.,"To rule out coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) in patients scheduled to undergo emergency medical procedures, SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) must be performed. In developing countries, the use of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR has been limited by its unavailability and long processing time. Hence, a quick screening score to predict COVID-19 may help healthcare practitioners determine which patients without acute respiratory symptoms can safely undergo an emergency medical procedure. We conducted a cross-sectional study of adult patients without acute respiratory symptoms who were admitted to the emergency department and underwent an emergency medical procedure within 24 hours after admittance. We collected baseline demographic data, COVID-19 screening variables, and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR as the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed, and a scoring system was developed using statistically significant variables from the multivariate analysis. With data from 357 patients, multivariate backward stepwise logistic regression analysis resulted in two significant COVID-19 predictors: the presence of SARS-CoV-2-IgM antibody (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 7.02 [95% CI: 1.49-32.96]) and typical chest x-ray (aOR: 23.21 [95% CI: 10.01-53.78]). A scoring system was developed using these predictors with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.64-0.78). For a cutoff point of >/= 2, the scoring system showed 42.5% sensitivity and 97.1% specificity but had poor calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow test P value < 0.001). We believe that the development of this COVID-19 quick screening score may be helpful in a resource-limited clinical setting, but its moderate discrimination and poor calibration hinder its use as a replacement for the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test for COVID-19 screening.","Nainggolan L, Dewi BE, Harianja GA, Saharman YR, Sanjaya NP, Sinto R, van Gorp ECM",Am J Trop Med Hyg,2023 Jun 7,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
34118736,"SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and pregnancy-related conditions: Concerns, challenges, management and mitigation strategies-a narrative review.","The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global public health problem. The SARS-CoV-2 triggers hyper-activation of inflammatory and immune responses resulting in cytokine storm and increased inflammatory responses on several organs like lungs, kidneys, intestine, and placenta. Although SARS-CoV-2 affects individuals of all age groups and physiological statuses, immune-compromised individuals such as pregnant women are considered as a highly vulnerable group. This review aims to raise the concerns of high risk of infection, morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 in pregnant women and provides critical reviews of pathophysiology and pathobiology of how SARS-CoV-2 infection potentially increases the severity and fatality during pregnancy. This article also provides a discussion of current evidence on vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Lastly, guidelines on management, treatment, preventive, and mitigation strategies of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and pregnancy-related conditions such as delivery and breastfeeding are discussed.","Kumar R, Yeni CM, Utami NA, Masand R, Asrani RK, Patel SK, Kumar A, Yatoo MI, Tiwari R, Natesan S, Vora KS, Nainu F, Bilal M, Dhawan M, Emran TB, Ahmad T, Harapan H, Dhama K",J Infect Public Health,2021 Jul,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
38802702,The roles of the kynurenine pathway in COVID-19 neuropathogenesis.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the highly contagious respiratory disease Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) that may lead to various neurological and psychological disorders that can be acute, lasting days to weeks or months and possibly longer. The latter is known as long-COVID or more recently post-acute sequelae of COVID (PASC). During acute COVID-19 infection, a strong inflammatory response, known as the cytokine storm, occurs in some patients. The levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interferon-beta (IFN-beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are particularly increased. These cytokines are known to activate the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO-1), catalysing the first step of tryptophan (Trp) catabolism through the kynurenine pathway (KP) leading to the production of several neurotoxic and immunosuppressive metabolites. There is already data showing elevation in KP metabolites both acutely and in PASC, especially regarding cognitive impairment. Thus, it is likely that KP involvement is significant in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis especially neurologically.","Dehhaghi M, Heydari M, Panahi HKS, Lewin SR, Heng B, Brew BJ, Guillemin GJ",Infection,2024 Oct,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
34549260,Understanding the Potential Impact of Different Drug Properties on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Transmission and Disease Burden: A Modelling Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The public health impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has motivated a rapid search for potential therapeutics, with some key successes. However, the potential impact of different treatments, and consequently research and procurement priorities, have not been clear. METHODS: Using a mathematical model of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission, COVID-19 disease and clinical care, we explore the public-health impact of different potential therapeutics, under a range of scenarios varying healthcare capacity, epidemic trajectories; and drug efficacy in the absence of supportive care. RESULTS: The impact of drugs like dexamethasone (delivered to the most critically-ill in hospital and whose therapeutic benefit is expected to depend on the availability of supportive care such as oxygen and mechanical ventilation) is likely to be limited in settings where healthcare capacity is lowest or where uncontrolled epidemics result in hospitals being overwhelmed. As such, it may avert 22% of deaths in high-income countries but only 8% in low-income countries (assuming R = 1.35). Therapeutics for different patient populations (those not in hospital, early in the course of infection) and types of benefit (reducing disease severity or infectiousness, preventing hospitalization) could have much greater benefits, particularly in resource-poor settings facing large epidemics. CONCLUSIONS: Advances in the treatment of COVID-19 to date have been focused on hospitalized-patients and predicated on an assumption of adequate access to supportive care. Therapeutics delivered earlier in the course of infection that reduce the need for healthcare or reduce infectiousness could have significant impact, and research into their efficacy and means of delivery should be a priority.","Whittaker C, Watson OJ, Alvarez-Moreno C, Angkasekwinai N, Boonyasiri A, Carlos Triana L, Chanda D, Charoenpong L, Chayakulkeeree M, Cooke GS, Croda J, Cucunuba ZM, Djaafara BA, Estofolete CF, Grillet ME, Faria NR, Figueiredo Costa S, Forero-Pena DA, Gibb DM, Gordon AC, Hamers RL, Hamlet A, Irawany V, Jitmuang A, Keurueangkul N, Kimani TN, Lampo M, Levin AS, Lopardo G, Mustafa R, Nayagam S, Ngamprasertchai T, Njeri NIH, Nogueira ML, Ortiz-Prado E, Perroud MW, Phillips AN, Promsin P, Qavi A, Rodger AJ, Sabino EC, Sangkaew S, Sari D, Sirijatuphat R, Sposito AC, Srisangthong P, Thompson HA, Udwadia Z, Valderrama-Beltran S, Winskill P, Ghani AC, Walker PGT, Hallett TB",Clin Infect Dis,2022 Aug 24,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
23369797,Global and regional burden of hospital admissions for severe acute lower respiratory infections in young children in 2010: a systematic analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The annual number of hospital admissions and in-hospital deaths due to severe acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) in young children worldwide is unknown. We aimed to estimate the incidence of admissions and deaths for such infections in children younger than 5 years in 2010. METHODS: We estimated the incidence of admissions for severe and very severe ALRI in children younger than 5 years, stratified by age and region, with data from a systematic review of studies published between Jan 1, 1990, and March 31, 2012, and from 28 unpublished population-based studies. We applied these incidence estimates to population estimates for 2010, to calculate the global and regional burden in children admitted with severe ALRI in that year. We estimated in-hospital mortality due to severe and very severe ALRI by combining incidence estimates with case fatality ratios from hospital-based studies. FINDINGS: We identified 89 eligible studies and estimated that in 2010, 11.9 million (95% CI 10.3-13.9 million) episodes of severe and 3.0 million (2.1-4.2 million) episodes of very severe ALRI resulted in hospital admissions in young children worldwide. Incidence was higher in boys than in girls, the sex disparity being greatest in South Asian studies. On the basis of data from 37 hospital studies reporting case fatality ratios for severe ALRI, we estimated that roughly 265,000 (95% CI 160,000-450,000) in-hospital deaths took place in young children, with 99% of these deaths in developing countries. Therefore, the data suggest that although 62% of children with severe ALRI are treated in hospitals, 81% of deaths happen outside hospitals. INTERPRETATION: Severe ALRI is a substantial burden on health services worldwide and a major cause of hospital referral and admission in young children. Improved hospital access and reduced inequities, such as those related to sex and rural status, could substantially decrease mortality related to such infection. Community-based management of severe disease could be an important complementary strategy to reduce pneumonia mortality and health inequities.

31692563,Orbital cellulitis clinically mimicking rhabdomyosarcoma.,"INTRODUCTION: Proptosis in children with acute-onset accompanied by signs of inflammation is commonly caused by orbital cellulitis, however, the possibility of rhabdomyosarcoma should always be considered by the clinician. This is a case report of a five-year-old boy presenting with an acute-onset of proptosis without a history of trauma and systemic infection. Our clinical differential diagnosis included orbital cellulitis and orbital rhabdomyosarcoma. PURPOSE: To report a case of orbital cellulitis that clinically and radiologically mimics rhabdomyosarcoma. CASE PRESENTATION: A five-year-old boy presented with rapid-onset proptosis, periorbital edema, pain and visual loss in the left eye for two weeks without a history of trauma, upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis or immunosuppression. Our clinical differential diagnosis includes rhabdomyosarcoma and orbital cellulitis. Complete blood count reveals a leukocytosis. Multislice computed tomography (MSCT) scan shows lesions involving the lateral orbit and the retro bulbar space. Antibiotics combination and adjunct anti-inflammatory intravenously shows excellent clinical resolution. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates difficulty in differentiating acute orbital cellulitis from rhabdomyosarcoma based on clinical findings. In addition, the case highlights that antibiotic combination of cephalosporin and aminoglycosides together with an adjuvant corticosteroid as an anti-inflammatory was effective in the case of acute orbital cellulitis.","Amir SP, Kamaruddin MI, Akib MNR, Sirajuddin J",Int Med Case Rep J,2019,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia

33150229,Mothers' knowledge of breastfeeding and infant feeding types affect acute respiratory infections.,"INTRODUCTION: World Health Organization (WHO) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for new-borns until 6 months of age. However, exclusive breastfeeding in Indonesia only reached 52.3% in 2014 and 65.16% in 2018. It is known that administration of infant formula and non-formula supplements to infants aged less than 6 months increases the risk of Acute Respiratory Infections (ARIs). In addition, the high prevalence of ARIs in infants in Sleman Regency, Indonesia indicates the need of optimal early prevention. Therefore, we conducted this study to confirm that mothers' knowledge of breastfeeding and infant feeding types affect the prevalence of Acute Respiratory Infections (ARIs). METHODS: Data were collected through questionnaires from 50 mothers with infants aged 7-12 months who had experienced ARIs in the last 3 months (case group) and 50 mothers with healthy infants (control group). Collected data were then analysed using Chi-Square, Logistic Regression, Lambda, and Somers' D tests. RESULTS: The results showed that types of infant feeding are associated with the prevalence of ARIs. Non-breastfed infants were 14 times riskier to contract ARIs. Mothers' knowledge of exclusive breastfeeding influenced their preferences of feeding practice. However, their attitude towards breastfeeding did not appear to significantly affect their choices of feeding practice. CONCLUSIONS: Exclusive breastfeeding during the first 6 months of an infant's life can lower the prevalence of ARIs for when they are older. Mothers' good knowledge of breastfeeding is associated with its practice.","Jansen S, Wasityastuti W, Astarini FD, Hartini S",J Prev Med Hyg,2020 Sep,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
34772768,A Systematic Review of Clinical Prediction Rules for the Diagnosis of Influenza.,"BACKGROUND: Clinical prediction rules (CPRs) can assist clinicians by focusing their clinical evaluation on the most important signs and symptoms, and if used properly can reduce the need for diagnostic testing. This study aims to perform an updated systematic review of clinical prediction rules and classification and regression tree (CART) models for the diagnosis of influenza. METHODS: We searched PubMed, CINAHL, and EMBASE databases. We identified prospective studies of patients presenting with suspected influenza or respiratory infection and that reported a CPR in the form of a risk score or CART-based algorithm. Studies had to report at a minimum the percentage of patients in each risk group with influenza. Studies were evaluated for inclusion and data were extracted by reviewers working in parallel. Accuracy was summarized descriptively; where not reported by the authors the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCC), predictive values, and likelihood ratios were calculated. RESULTS: We identified 10 studies that presented 14 CPRs. The most commonly included predictor variables were cough, fever, chills and/or sweats, myalgias, and acute onset, all which can be ascertained by phone or telehealth visit. Most CPRs had an AUROCC between 0.7 and 0.8, indicating good discrimination. However, only 1 rule has undergone prospective external validation, with limited success. Data reporting by the original studies was in some cases inadequate to determine measures of accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Well-designed validation studies, studies of interrater reliability between telehealth an in-person assessment, and studies using novel data mining and artificial intelligence strategies are needed to improve diagnosis of this common and important infection.","Ebell MH, Rahmatullah I, Cai X, Bentivegna M, Hulme C, Thompson M, Lutz B",J Am Board Fam Med,2021 Nov-Dec,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia

35027498,Molecular Mechanism of -Acute Sarcopenia in Elderly Patient with COVID - 19.,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Case fatality rate has been on the rise among older adults. Muscle loss is a consequence of several chronic diseases (chronic sarcopenia) and recent theory also suggested that acute sarcopenia may caused by acute significant stressor such as an acute illness, surgery, infections, trauma or burns including COVID-19 infection leading to further muscle loss in elderly. Cytokine storm, the hallmark of COVID-19 pathogenesis will induce various pro-inflammatory cytokine such as IL-1 and IL-6 causing acute sarcopenia by activating negative regulators like NF-kappaB, atrogin-1, MURF-1. Long standing chronic inflammation also known as inflammaging along with acute inflammation during COVID-19 in elderly will cause reticulum endoplasmic and mitochondria stress activating caspase and finally increase both cytosolic and nuclear levels of AIF and EndoG to induce acute sarcopenia. Several precipitating factors shared same molecular pathway like physical inactivity and hormonal dysregulation which act through IGF-1-AKT-mTOR pathway. Physical inactivity during COVID-19 infection also induced myostatin and Atrogin-1/ MaFbx/ MuRF pathway. This review provides recent research advances dealing with molecular pathway modulating muscle mass in acute sarcopenia during COVID-19 infection.","Aryana IGPS, Setiati S, Rini SS",Acta Med Indones,2021 Oct,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
36517555,Outcome in early vs late intubation among COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Timing of endotracheal intubation in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains controversial regarding its risk and benefit in patient outcomes. Our study aims to elucidate early versus late intubation outcomes among COVID-19 patients with ARDS. A protocol of this study is registered at the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO) (CRD42021230272). We report our systematic review based on PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. We searched the Cochrane Library, EBSCOhost, EMBASE, Grey Literature Report, OpenGrey, ProQuest, PubMed, and ScienceDirect from inception until 4 December 2021. Titles and abstracts were reviewed for their relevance. The risk of bias in each study was evaluated using the risk of bias in non-randomised studies-of interventions (ROBINS-I) guideline. Trial sequential analysis is done to elucidate firm evidence. We retrieved 20 observational studies that assessed an intervention (early vs. late intubation). Meta-analysis for in-hospital mortality reduction showed 119 fewer deaths per 1000 patients in early intubation. Early intubation reduces 2.81 days of ICU length of stay (LOS) and 2.12 days of ventilation duration. Benefits for mortality and ICU LOS reduction were based on studies with low to moderate risk of bias while ventilation duration was based on low disease burden setting. According to the contextualized approach, the benefit of mortality reduction showed a trivial effect, while ICU LOS and ventilation duration showed a small effect. GRADE certainty of evidence for mortality reduction in early intubation is moderate. The certainty of evidence for ICU length of stay, ventilation duration, ventilator-free days, and continuous renal replacement therapy are very low. This updated systematic review provided new evidence that early intubation might provide benefits in treating COVID-19 patients with ARDS. The benefits of early intubation appear to have an important but small effect based on contextualized approach for ICU LOS and ventilation duration. In reducing in-hospital mortality, the early intubation effect was present but only trivial based on contextualized approach. TSA showed that more studies are needed to elucidate firmer evidence.","Ridjab DA, Ivan I, Budiman F, Juzar DA",Sci Rep,2022 Dec 14,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia

Beside acute respiratory distress syndrome found in acute phase of infection, there is also pulmonary fibrosis as a chronic complication due to COVID-19. With the global pandemic of COVID-19, more and more autopsy and puncture histopathological results have been published.Until now there is no specific therapy to handle post-inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis due to COVID-19 infection. Several studies are ongoing to determine an effective treatment for this chronic complication. While ARDS appears to be the main cause of pulmonary fibrosis in COVID-19, the pathogenesis of ARDS caused by SARS-CoV-2 is different from the typical ARDS. Some therapies may be considered for reducing the fibrosis process in lung after COVI-19 infection namely pirfenidone, nintedanib and mesenchymal stem cells. Many patients are still recovering spontaneously in the first six weeks after acute COVID-19 infection and do not generally require fast-track entry into a pulmonary rehabilitation programme. However, those who have significantly persistent respiratory illness may need to be supported by pulmonary rehabilitation. Multidisciplinary intervention based on personalized evaluation and treatment which includes exercise training, education and behavioral modification can be given to improve the physical and psychological condition of patients with post-COVID pulmonary fibrosis.",Rumende CM,Acta Med Indones,2021 Apr,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
28452967,Evaluation of Rational Drug Use for Acute Pharyngitis Associated with the Incidence and Prevalence of the Disease at Two Community Health Centers in Indonesia.,"According to Indonesia's Result of Basic Health Research of 2013, prevalence of acute respiratory infection in 2007 and 2013 were not significantly different (25.5% and 25.0%, respectively). Identifying the cause of acute pharyngitis is a key point in determining the optimal treatment. The main purpose is to evaluate the rational use of drugs and its irrational impact as well as the correlation of the drug use with the incidence and prevalence of acute pharyngitis. This study was a descriptive and observational study, carried out retrospectively and concurrently at two community health centers located in Bandung and Cimahi, Indonesia. There was overprescription of antibiotics in 80.01% of prescription cases, with a total of 8.98% being non-treatment option, and 62.43% being irrational use of corticosteroids. The incidence and prevalence of acute pharyngitis at one health center in Bandung were 2.45% and 2.31%, respectively, with an irrationality rate of 83.82%. Those recorded at one health center in Cimahi were 2.11% incidence and 2.00% prevalence with an irrational rate of 91.29%. It can be concluded that there is still an irrational use of medicines in the treatment of acute pharyngitis in community health centers. The higher incidence and prevalence might indicate the declining quality of health services.","Yuniar CT, Anggadiredja K, Islamiyah AN",Sci Pharm,2017 Apr 28,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
34733644,Psychiatric sequelae in COVID-19 survivors: A narrative review.,"In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was initially reported in Wuhan, China. Previous epidemics including SARS and middle east respiratory syndrome raises concern that COVID-19 infection may pose a significant threat to the mental health of affected individuals. Studies and reviews have shown the acute psychiatric manifestations in COVID-19 patients, although long term psychiatric sequelae are predicted, there are only few review studies about the long term psychiatry outcome in COVID-19 survivors. Clinically significant post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and/or depression among COVID-19 survivors during 14-90 d were observed following the diagnosis. Risk of anxiety or depression were higher in patients with more severe illness at 6 mo follow-up, early convalescence, and at 1 mo follow-up. Diagnosis of COVID-19 Led to more first diagnoses and relapses of psychiatric illness during the first 14-90 d after COVID-19 diagnosis. The possible underlying mechanisms of psychiatric sequelae in COVID-19 infection are neurotropism, immune response to SARS-CoV-2, hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity, disrupted neuronal circuits in several brain regions, increased stress levels, neuroinflammation, and neuronal death. This study will review the psychiatric sequelae in previous coronavirus pandemics, current studies, risk factors, and thorough explanation on pathophysiology of the psychiatric sequalae in COVID-19 survivors.","Putri C, Arisa J, Hananto JE, Hariyanto TI, Kurniawan A",World J Psychiatry,2021 Oct 19,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
35689351,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) update: From metabolic reprogramming to immunometabolism.,"The field of immunometabolism investigates and describes the effects of metabolic rewiring in immune cells throughout activation and the fates of these cells. Recently, it has been appreciated that immunometabolism plays an essential role in the progression of viral infections, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. Regarding COVID-19, the aberrant immune response underlying the progression of diseases establishes two major respiratory pathologies, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or pneumonia-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Both innate and adaptive immunity (T cell-based) were impaired in the course of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Current findings have deciphered that macrophages (innate immune cells) are involved in the inflammatory response seen in COVID-19. It has been demonstrated that immune system cells can change metabolic reprogramming in some conditions, including autoimmune diseases, cancer, and infectious disease, including COVID-19. The growing findings on metabolic reprogramming in COVID-19 allow an exploration of metabolites with immunomodulatory properties as future therapies to combat this hyperinflammatory response. The elucidation of the exact role and mechanism underlying this metabolic reprograming in immune cells could help apply more precise approaches to initial diagnosis, prognosis, and in-hospital therapy. This report discusses the latest findings from COVID-19 on host metabolic reprogramming and immunometabolic responses.","Rudiansyah M, Jasim SA, Mohammad Pour ZG, Athar SS, Jeda AS, Doewes RI, Jalil AT, Bokov DO, Mustafa YF, Noroozbeygi M, Karampoor S, Mirzaei R",J Med Virol,2022 Oct,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
38988895,The effects of mouth rinsing and gargling with mouthwash containing povidone-iodine and hydrogen peroxide on the cycle threshold value of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2: A randomized controlled trial of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients.,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 can spread rapidly. Surgery in the oral cavity poses a high risk of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The American Dental Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend the use of mouthwash containing 1.5% hydrogen peroxide (H (2)O (2)) or 0.2% povidone iodine (PI) to reduce the viral load in the upper respiratory tract and decrease the risk of transmission. The aim of the present study was to analyze the effect of mouth rinsing and gargling with mouthwash containing 1% PI, 0.5% PI, 3% H (2)O (2), or 1.5% H (2)O (2) and water on the cycle threshold (CT) value obtained by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). METHODS: This study is a randomized single blind controlled clinical trial which has been registered in the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) registry on the 3 (rd) February 2022 (Registration number: ISRCTN18356379). In total, 69 subjects recruited from Persahabatan General Hospital who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups or the control group. The subjects were instructed to gargle with 15 mL of mouthwash for 30 s in the oral cavity followed by 30 s in the back of the throat, three times per day for 5 days. CT values were collected on postprocedural days 1, 3, and 5. RESULTS: The results of the Friedman test significantly differed among the groups (n=15). The CT values increased from baseline (day 0) to postprocedural days 1, 3, and 5. CONCLUSIONS: Mouth rinsing and gargling with mouthwash containing 1% PI, 0.5% PI, 3% H (2)O (2), or 1.5% H (2)O (2) and water increased the CT value.","Sulistyani LD, Julia V, Soeprapto A, Swari RP, Rosmanato F, Haryanto B, Cahyarini C, Panjaitan R, Maharani DA",F1000Res,2022,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia

33586302,"SARS-CoV-2, Covid-19, and the debunking of conspiracy theories.","The emergence of a novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has engaged considerable awareness and attention around the world. The associated disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), has now involved virtually all 200 countries. The total number of confirmed cases has been much more than in the two previous outbreaks of human coronaviruses, that is, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. In line with the outbreak escalation, false information about SARS-CoV-2 and its associated disease disseminated globally, particularly through online and social media. Believers in conspiracy theories promote misinformation that the virus is not contagious, is the result of laboratory manipulation or is created to gain profit by distributing new vaccines. The most dangerous effect of this widely disseminated misinformation is it will negatively influence the attitudes and behaviours for preventive measures to contain the outbreak. In this review, I discuss common conspiracy theories associated with SARS-CoV-2 and Covid-19 and consider how we can address and counterbalance these issues based on scientific information and studies.",Hakim MS,Rev Med Virol,2021 Nov,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
33647033,Global burden of influenza-associated lower respiratory tract infections and hospitalizations among adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Influenza illness burden is substantial, particularly among young children, older adults, and those with underlying conditions. Initiatives are underway to develop better global estimates for influenza-associated hospitalizations and deaths. Knowledge gaps remain regarding the role of influenza viruses in severe respiratory disease and hospitalizations among adults, particularly in lower-income settings. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We aggregated published data from a systematic review and unpublished data from surveillance platforms to generate global meta-analytic estimates for the proportion of acute respiratory hospitalizations associated with influenza viruses among adults. We searched 9 online databases (Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Global Health, LILACS, WHOLIS, and CNKI; 1 January 1996-31 December 2016) to identify observational studies of influenza-associated hospitalizations in adults, and assessed eligible papers for bias using a simplified Newcastle-Ottawa scale for observational data. We applied meta-analytic proportions to global estimates of lower respiratory infections (LRIs) and hospitalizations from the Global Burden of Disease study in adults >/=20 years and by age groups (20-64 years and >/=65 years) to obtain the number of influenza-associated LRI episodes and hospitalizations for 2016. Data from 63 sources showed that influenza was associated with 14.1% (95% CI 12.1%-16.5%) of acute respiratory hospitalizations among all adults, with no significant differences by age group. The 63 data sources represent published observational studies (n = 28) and unpublished surveillance data (n = 35), from all World Health Organization regions (Africa, n = 8; Americas, n = 11; Eastern Mediterranean, n = 7; Europe, n = 8; Southeast Asia, n = 11; Western Pacific, n = 18). Data quality for published data sources was predominantly moderate or high (75%, n = 56/75). We estimate 32,126,000 (95% CI 20,484,000-46,129,000) influenza-associated LRI episodes and 5,678,000 (95% CI 3,205,000-9,432,000) LRI hospitalizations occur each year among adults. While adults <65 years contribute most influenza-associated LRI hospitalizations and episodes (3,464,000 [95% CI 1,885,000-5,978,000] LRI hospitalizations and 31,087,000 [95% CI 19,987,000-44,444,000] LRI episodes), hospitalization rates were highest in those >/=65 years (437/100,000 person-years [95% CI 265-612/100,000 person-years]). For this analysis, published articles were limited in their inclusion of stratified testing data by year and age group. Lack of information regarding influenza vaccination of the study population was also a limitation across both types of data sources. CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis, we estimated that influenza viruses are associated with over 5 million hospitalizations worldwide per year. Inclusion of both published and unpublished findings allowed for increased power to generate stratified estimates, and improved representation from lower-income countries. Together, the available data demonstrate the importance of influenza viruses as a cause of severe disease and hospitalizations in younger and older adults worldwide.","Lafond KE, Porter RM, Whaley MJ, Suizan Z, Ran Z, Aleem MA, Thapa B, Sar B, Proschle VS, Peng Z, Feng L, Coulibaly D, Nkwembe E, Olmedo A, Ampofo W, Saha S, Chadha M, Mangiri A, Setiawaty V, Ali SS, Chaves SS, Otorbaeva D, Keosavanh O, Saleh M, Ho A, Alexander B, Oumzil H, Baral KP, Huang QS, Adebayo AA, Al-Abaidani I, von Horoch M, Cohen C, Tempia S, Mmbaga V, Chittaganpitch M, Casal M, Dang DA, Couto P, Nair H, Bresee JS, Olsen SJ, Azziz-Baumgartner E, Nuorti JP, Widdowson MA",PLoS Med,2021 Mar,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
33621130,Perspectives on Targeting IL-6 as a Potential Therapeutic Strategy for COVID-19.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has been a major threat to global public health. In Indonesia, the cases have rapidly increased, and the case fatality rate remains high. With COVID-19, most of the deaths have been caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome and dysregulation of the immune response. A lung biopsy from a patient with COVID-19 showed inflammatory cellular infiltration with diffuse alveolar damage. Massive pulmonary destruction has also been reported as a result of highly increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1beta, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), induced protein 10 (IP-10), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). IL-6 is an inflammatory cytokine produced by various cell types, including immune cells and nonleukocytes, such as endothelial cells, fibroblasts, epithelial cells, type II pneumocytes, and certain tumor cells. Several studies have shown that IL-6 contributes to the severity and mortality of COVID-19. In this review, we would like to explore the immune response in COVID-19 and the role of IL-6 in the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19.","Khaedir Y, Kartika R",J Interferon Cytokine Res,2021 Feb,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia

In this article, we elaborate the possible role of estrogen in the modulation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection severity. The potential interplay between several factors, including inherently lower estradiol (E(2)) and slightly higher estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) levels in males, with inflammatory mediators are described. Altogether, there seems to be a sexually dimorphic response towards SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a possibility that COVID-19 severity is dependent on both E(2) levels and ERalpha:ERbeta expression ratio in lymphoid and lung cells.","Ulhaq ZS, Soraya GV, Zambrano LEA, Garcia CP",Acta Endocrinol (Buchar),2020 Oct-Dec,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
37389095,Immunological dysfunction and mast cell activation syndrome in long COVID.,"At least 65 million people around the world suffer from long COVID-19, with the majority of cases occurring in the productive age (36-50 years old). Individuals with long COVID-19 are confounded with multiple organ system dysfunctions, long-term organ injury sequelae, and a decreased quality of life. There is an overlapping of risk factors between long COVID-19 and other postviral infection syndromes, so advances in research could also benefit other groups of patients. Long COVID-19 is the consequence of multiple immune system dysregulation, such as T-cell depletion, innate immune cell hyperactivity, lack of naive T and B cells, and elevated signature of pro-inflammatory cytokines, together with persistent severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 reservoir and other consequences of acute infection. There is an activated condition of mast cells in long COVID-19, with abnormal granulation and excessive inflammatory cytokine release. A study by Weinstock et al. indicates that patients with long COVID-19 suffer the same clinical syndrome as patients with mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS). Diagnosis and treatment of MCAS in patients with long COVID-19 will provide further symptomatic relief, and manage mast cell-mediated hyperinflammation states, which could be useful in the long-term control and recovery of such patients.","Sumantri S, Rengganis I",Asia Pac Allergy,2023 Mar,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
34066563,Respiratory Infections Following Earthquake-Induced Tsunamis: Transmission Risk Factors and Lessons Learned for Disaster Risk Management.,"Earthquake-induced tsunamis have the potential to cause extensive damage to natural and built environments and are often associated with fatalities, injuries, and infectious disease outbreaks. This review aims to examine the occurrence of respiratory infections (RIs) and to elucidate the risk factors of RI transmission following tsunamis which were induced by earthquakes in the last 20 years. Forty-seven articles were included in this review and referred to the RIs emergence following the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman, the 2009 Samoa, and the 2011 Japan earthquakes. Polymicrobial RIs were commonly detected among near-drowned tsunami survivors. Influenza outbreaks were commonly detected during the influenza transmission period. Overcrowded conditions in evacuation centers contributed to increased acute RI incidence rate, measles transmission, and tuberculosis detection. Destruction of health care infrastructures, overcrowded evacuation shelters, exposure to high pathogen densities, aggravating weather conditions, regional disease endemicity, and low vaccination coverage were the major triggering factors of RI occurrence in post-tsunami disaster settings. Knowledge of risk factors underlying RIs emergence following earthquake-induced tsunami can contribute to the implementation of appropriate disaster prevention and preparedness plans characterized by sufficient environmental planning, resistant infrastructures, resilient health care facilities, and well-established evacuation centers. Global and local disease surveillance is a key prerequisite for early warning and protection against RIs' emergence and transmission in tsunami-prone areas.","Mavrouli M, Mavroulis S, Lekkas E, Tsakris A",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2021 May 6,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
38965510,Post-COVID syndrome prevalence: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Since the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic began, the number of individuals recovering from COVID-19 infection have increased. Post-COVID Syndrome, or PCS, which is defined as signs and symptoms that develop during or after infection in line with COVID-19, continue beyond 12 weeks, and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis, has also gained attention. We systematically reviewed and determined the pooled prevalence estimate of PCS worldwide based on published literature. METHODS: Relevant articles from the Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Ovid MEDLINE databases were screened using a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-guided systematic search process. The included studies were in English, published from January 2020 to April 2024, had overall PCS prevalence as one of the outcomes studied, involved a human population with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and undergone assessment at 12 weeks post-COVID infection or beyond. As the primary outcome measured, the pooled prevalence of PCS was estimated from a meta-analysis of the PCS prevalence data extracted from individual studies, which was conducted via the random-effects model. This study has been registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023435280). RESULTS: Forty eight studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in this review. 16 were accepted for meta-analysis to estimate the pooled prevalence for PCS worldwide, which was 41.79% (95% confidence interval [CI] 39.70-43.88%, I(2) = 51%, p = 0.03). Based on different assessment or follow-up timepoints after acute COVID-19 infection, PCS prevalence estimated at >/= 3rd, >/= 6th, and >/= 12th months timepoints were each 45.06% (95% CI: 41.25-48.87%), 41.30% (95% CI: 34.37-48.24%), and 41.32% (95% CI: 39.27-43.37%), respectively. Sex-stratified PCS prevalence was estimated at 47.23% (95% CI: 44.03-50.42%) in male and 52.77% (95% CI: 49.58-55.97%) in female. Based on continental regions, pooled PCS prevalence was estimated at 46.28% (95% CI: 39.53%-53.03%) in Europe, 46.29% (95% CI: 35.82%-56.77%) in America, 49.79% (95% CI: 30.05%-69.54%) in Asia, and 42.41% (95% CI: 0.00%-90.06%) in Australia. CONCLUSION: The prevalence estimates in this meta-analysis could be used in further comprehensive studies on PCS, which might enable the development of better PCS management plans to reduce the effect of PCS on population health and the related economic burden.","Sk Abd Razak R, Ismail A, Abdul Aziz AF, Suddin LS, Azzeri A, Sha'ari NI",BMC Public Health,2024 Jul 4,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
27011229,"Global Role and Burden of Influenza in Pediatric Respiratory Hospitalizations, 1982-2012: A Systematic Analysis.","BACKGROUND: The global burden of pediatric severe respiratory illness is substantial, and influenza viruses contribute to this burden. Systematic surveillance and testing for influenza among hospitalized children has expanded globally over the past decade. However, only a fraction of the data has been used to estimate influenza burden. In this analysis, we use surveillance data to provide an estimate of influenza-associated hospitalizations among children worldwide. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We aggregated data from a systematic review (n = 108) and surveillance platforms (n = 37) to calculate a pooled estimate of the proportion of samples collected from children hospitalized with respiratory illnesses and positive for influenza by age group (<6 mo, <1 y, <2 y, <5 y, 5-17 y, and <18 y). We applied this proportion to global estimates of acute lower respiratory infection hospitalizations among children aged <1 y and <5 y, to obtain the number and per capita rate of influenza-associated hospitalizations by geographic region and socio-economic status. Influenza was associated with 10% (95% CI 8%-11%) of respiratory hospitalizations in children <18 y worldwide, ranging from 5% (95% CI 3%-7%) among children <6 mo to 16% (95% CI 14%-20%) among children 5-17 y. On average, we estimated that influenza results in approximately 374,000 (95% CI 264,000 to 539,000) hospitalizations in children <1 y-of which 228,000 (95% CI 150,000 to 344,000) occur in children <6 mo-and 870,000 (95% CI 610,000 to 1,237,000) hospitalizations in children <5 y annually. Influenza-associated hospitalization rates were more than three times higher in developing countries than in industrialized countries (150/100,000 children/year versus 48/100,000). However, differences in hospitalization practices between settings are an important limitation in interpreting these findings. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza is an important contributor to respiratory hospitalizations among young children worldwide. Increasing influenza vaccination coverage among young children and pregnant women could reduce this burden and protect infants <6 mo.","Lafond KE, Nair H, Rasooly MH, Valente F, Booy R, Rahman M, Kitsutani P, Yu H, Guzman G, Coulibaly D, Armero J, Jima D, Howie SR, Ampofo W, Mena R, Chadha M, Sampurno OD, Emukule GO, Nurmatov Z, Corwin A, Heraud JM, Noyola DE, Cojocaru R, Nymadawa P, Barakat A, Adedeji A, von Horoch M, Olveda R, Nyatanyi T, Venter M, Mmbaga V, Chittaganpitch M, Nguyen TH, Theo A, Whaley M, Azziz-Baumgartner E, Bresee J, Campbell H, Widdowson MA",PLoS Med,2016 Mar,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
25108503,Maternal agency influences the prevalence of diarrhea and acute respiratory tract infections among young Indonesian children.,"To examine the relationship between measures of mother's caretaking, practice and individual agency on acute diarrhea and respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) of Indonesian children. Using population-based household data from the Indonesian Demographic Health Surveys for 2002-2003 (n = 9,151 children) and 2007 (n = 9,714 children), we selected 28 indicators related to mother' caretaking, and applied principal component analysis to derive indices for access to care, practice and experience, and agency. The association between index quartiles (level 1-4) and the prevalence of diarrhea and ARTIs in the youngest child <5 years of age was assessed with multivariate logistic regression adjusting for socioeconomic status, residence type, mother's age and education, family size, child's age and sex, immunization status and received vitamin A supplementation. Moderate levels (level 3) of practice and experience were associated with decreased diarrheal risk (adjusted OR 0.86, 95 % CI 0.75-0.98), but not for ARTIs. Children of mothers with higher levels (level 4) of agency were protected against both diarrhea (adjusted OR 0.68, 95 % CI 0.60-0.77) and ARTIs (adjusted OR 0.77, 95 % CI 0.66-0.91). Stratified analyses with child's age and mother's education, and tests of interaction, showed that agency had a stronger effect on diarrhea and ARTIs prevalence in children <2 years of age. Maternal caretaking, especially agency, is strongly associated with lower prevalence of diarrhea and ARTIs in younger children. Interventions specifically designed to promote maternal autonomy and decision-making may lead to improved child health.","Agustina R, Shankar AV, Ayuningtyas A, Achadi EL, Shankar AH",Matern Child Health J,2015 May,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
32550259,Coronavirus disease 2019 and cardiovascular system: A narrative review.,"At the end of 2019, a viral pneumonia disease called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2), emerged in Wuhan, China. This novel disease rapidly spread at an alarming rate that as a result, it has now been declared pandemic by the World Health Organization. Although this infective disease is mostly characterized by respiratory tract symptoms, increasing numbers of evidence had shown considerable amounts of patients with cardiovascular involvements and these were associated with higher mortality among COVID-19 patients. Cardiac involvement as a possible late phenomenon of the viral respiratory infection is an issue that should be anticipated in patients with COVID-19. Cardiovascular manifestation in COVID-19 patients include myocardial injury (MI), arrhythmias, cardiac arrests, heart failure and coagulation abnormality, ranging from 7.2% up to 33%. The mechanism of cardiac involvement in COVID-19 patients involves direct injury to myocardial cells mediated by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors as suggested by some studies, while the other studies suggest that systemic inflammation causing indirect myocyte injury may also play a role. Combination of proper triage, close monitoring, and avoidance of some drugs that have cardiovascular toxicity are important in the management of cardiovascular system involvement in COVID-19 patients. The involvement of the cardiovascular system in COVID-19 patients is prevalent, variable, and debilitating. Therefore, it requires our attention and comprehensive management.","Kwenandar F, Japar KV, Damay V, Hariyanto TI, Tanaka M, Lugito NPH, Kurniawan A",Int J Cardiol Heart Vasc,2020 Aug,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia

She had runny nose and slightly inflamed pharynx. Her nasopharyngeal swab and real-time polymerase chain reaction were positive for the coronavirus disease 2019 nucleocapsid and open reading frame genes, with cycle threshold values of 32.33 and 33.74, respectively. Whole-genome sequencing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was performed using the Nextera DNA Flex for Enrichment using the Respiratory Virus Oligos Panel, Illumina MiSeq instruments, and Illumina MiSeq reagent v3 150 cycles (2 x 75 cycles). The full genomes were aligned to the reference genome (NC_045512.2) by the Burrow-Wheeler aligner algorithm. The whole-genome sequencing showed coinfection of Karolinska Institute polyomavirus Stockholm 60 (NC_009238.1) with an overall coverage of 3561x. The patient was given acetaminophen, vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc for the treatment and discharged uneventfully from the hospital 4 days after admission. Then, 2 weeks after discharge, she visited the outpatient clinic without any further concerns. CONCLUSION: This report presents a case of Karolinska Institute polyomavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 coinfection in a patient with nonspecific clinical manifestation. Further studies with a larger sample size are mandatory to clarify the association between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and Karolinska Institute polyomavirus coinfection, particularly on patient outcomes. Moreover, the results propose the usefulness of enrichment-based next-generation sequencing in detecting viral coinfection in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.","Gunadi, Geometri ET, Adhityo P, Abidin AZ, Marcellus, Puspitarani DA, Utami FDT, Iskandar K, Wibawa H, Hakim MS",J Med Case Rep,2024 Dec 31,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
8041239,"Acute respiratory illnesses in children under five years in Indramayu, west Java, Indonesia: a rapid ethnographic assessment.","A rapid, focused ethnographic study was carried out in a rural area of West Java, Indonesia to identify local beliefs, perceptions, and practices surrounding acute respiratory infections (ARI) in infants and young children. The study incorporates key informant interviews, open-ended interviews, and structured data collection from fifty mothers of young children selected to represent the geographical settlement pattern in the area: structured interviews with biomedical and indigenous health care providers; and structured interviews with fifty mothers who sought health care for an infant or young child with a respiratory illness. The most commonly perceived cause for ARI in children was air entering the body through some type of chill, exposure to draft or breeze, or change of weather. When fever or difficult breathing was present, mothers tended to increase the number and diversity the types of medicines used. Mothers recognized difficult as well as rapid breathing, both being described as ""difficult breathing."" More concern was expressed about fever than about difficulty in breathing. Effective medical care was more likely to be delayed for infants than for older children; infants were also more likely to be taken to an indigenous healer as the first-choice provider. Infants were less likely to receive an effective drug regimen even if appropriate medication was prescribed, because mothers commonly take the drugs in order to deliver them to the infant through breast milk.","Kresno S, Harrison GG, Sutrisna B, Reingold A",Med Anthropol,1994 May,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
33577374,Immunotherapies and immunomodulatory approaches in clinical trials - a mini review.,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has created havoc worldwide. Due to the non-availability of any vaccine or drugs against COVID-19, immunotherapies involving convalescent plasma, immunoglobulins, antibodies (monoclonal or polyclonal), and the use of immunomodulatory agents to enhance immunity are valuable alternative options. Cell-based therapies including natural killer cells, T cells, stem cells along with cytokines and toll-like receptors (TLRs) based therapies are also being exploited potentially against COVID-19. Future research need to strengthen the field of developing effective immunotherapeutics and immunomodulators with a thrust of providing appropriate, affordable, convenient, and cost-effective prophylactic and treatment regimens to combat global COVID-19 crisis that has led to a state of medical emergency enforcing entire countries of the world to devote their research infrastructure and manpower in tackling this pandemic.","Iqbal Yatoo M, Hamid Z, Rather I, Nazir QUA, Bhat RA, Ul Haq A, Magray SN, Haq Z, Sah R, Tiwari R, Natesan S, Bilal M, Harapan H, Dhama K",Hum Vaccin Immunother,2021 Jul 3,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
34229864,Humoral immune mechanisms involved in protective and pathological immunity during COVID-19.,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19 is associated with excessive inflammation, as a main reason for severe condition and death. Increased inflammatory cytokines and humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 correlate with COVID-19 immunity and pathogenesis. Importantly, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines that increase profoundly in systemic circulation appear as part of the clinical pictures of two overlapping conditions, sepsis and the hemophagocytic syndromes. Both conditions can develop lethal inflammatory responses that lead to tissue damage, however, in many patients hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) can be differentiated from sepsis. This is a key issue because the life-saving aggressive immunosuppressive treatment, required in the HLH therapy, is absent in sepsis guidelines. This paper aims to describe the pathophysiology and clinical relevance of these distinct entities in the course of COVID-19 that resemble sepsis and further highlights two effector arms of the humoral immune response (inflammatory cytokine and immunoglobulin production) during COVID-19 infection.","Widjaja G, Turki Jalil A, Sulaiman Rahman H, Abdelbasset WK, Bokov DO, Suksatan W, Ghaebi M, Marofi F, Gholizadeh Navashenaq J, Jadidi-Niaragh F, Ahmadi M",Hum Immunol,2021 Oct,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia

Referring to the Global Initiative for Asthma, the prevalence of asthma continues to increase especially in children. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that has declared a pandemic by the world health organization on March 2020. For many years, it has been known that people with asthma have a worse impact on respiratory viral infections. Asthma has been listed by the centers for disease control and prevention as one of the risk factors for COVID-19, although several studies have different results. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its cellular receptor, and it has been known that the expression of the ACE2 receptor is reduced in asthma patients. This reduced expression could also be accounted from the therapy of asthma. This paper aims to discuss the pathophysiology of asthma and COVID-19 and the susceptibility of asthma patients in contracting COVID-19.","Wisnu Wardana VA, Rosyid AN",Clin Med Insights Circ Respir Pulm Med,2021,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
22451191,National consensus on geriatric immunization 2011.,"As the growth of elderly population increases, the number of geriatric patients who may demand health care services is also increasing since the elderly are more vulnerable to various conditions of acute illnesses. Upper respiratory tract infections are the leading cause of death and the most significant cause that impairs quality of life in the elderly. Upper respiratory tract infections and influenza are common in the elderly and may develop into pneumonia. Considering the high morbidity and mortality rates related to pneumonia in the elderly, it is important to have prevention strategies. A delay in diagnosis due to non-specific signs and symptoms of pneumonia in the elderly has demanded greater concern on the importance of pneumonia prevention strategies. Influenza and pneumonia impair quality of life in the elderly, resulted in decreased functional status (ADL scores) during infection and recovery period. With increasing antibiotic resistance, the management may be complicated as it may lead to conditions that reduce quality of life and cause high mortality rate. Therefore, immunization is very important as the prevention strategy against influenza and or pneumonia, reducing the incidence as well as the complication. The consensus has been made in order to provide immunization against influenza and pneumonia for elderly population in Indonesia. It is expected that by 2025, about 60% of the elderly in Indonesia would have immunization against influenza and 50% of them would have immunization against pneumonia annually.",No authors listed,Acta Med Indones,2012 Jan,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
33723519,Potency of Mesenchymal Stem Cell and Its Secretome in Treating COVID-19.,"ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 disease, which is caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has affected the world by increasing the mortality rate in 2020. Currently, there is no definite treatment for COVID-19 patients. Several clinical trials have been proposed to overcome this disease and many are still under investigation. In this review, we will be focusing on the potency of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and MSC-derived secretome for treating COVID-19 patients. Fever, cough, headache, dizziness, and fatigue are the common clinical manifestations in COVID-19 patients. In mild and severe cases, cytokines are released hyper-actively which causes a cytokine storm leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In order to maintain the lung microenvironment in COVID-19 patients, MSCs are used as cell-based therapy approaches as they can act as cell managers which accelerate the immune system to prevent the cytokine storm and promote endogenous repair. Besides, MSCs have shown minimal expression of ACE2 or TMPRSS2, and hence, MSCs are free from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Numerous clinical studies have started worldwide and demonstrated that MSCs have great potential for ARDS treatment in COVID-19 patients. Preliminary data have shown that MSCs and MSC-derived secretome appear to be promising in the treatment of COVID-19. LAY SUMMARY: The COVID-19 disease is an infection disease which affects the world in 2020. Currently, there is no definite treatment for COVID-19 patients. However, several clinical trials have been proposed to overcome this disease and one of them is using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and MSC-derived secretome for treating COVID-19 patients. During the infection, cytokines are released hyper-actively which causes a cytokine storm. MSCs play an important role in maintaining the lung microenvironment in COVID-19 patients. They can act as cell managers which accelerate the immune system to prevent the cytokine storm and promote the endogenous repair. Therefore, it is important to explore the clinical trial in the world for treating the COVID-19 disease using MSCs and MSC-derived secretome.","Chouw A, Milanda T, Sartika CR, Kirana MN, Halim D, Faried A",Regen Eng Transl Med,2022,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia

The use of antibiotics is one way to treat respiratory diseases. This study aims to determine the level of resistance of levofloxacin antibiotics to clinical isolates from ARTIs patients at the Tasikmalaya Health Center, Indonesia. The stages of the research included rejuvenation of clinical single isolates from ARTIs patients, identification of bacteria, and antibiotic resistance testing using the paper-disc method. The results of resistance tests from 142 single clinical isolates of acute respiratory infections showed that levofloxacin antibiotics had high levels of resistance of 50.0%, 30.95% of resistance with intermediate levels, and 19.04% were still sensitive. Bacterial identification test results showed bacteria that have been resistant to levofloxacin are from the genus Haemophillus, Streptococcus, Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, and Bordetella. Treatment of ARTIs with the antibiotic levofloxacin shows that there has been a relatively large resistance, where the results of the identification of all bacteria showed the bacteria that cause ARTIs.","Ramdhani D, Azizah SN, Kusuma SAF, Sediana D",J Adv Pharm Technol Res,2020 Jul-Sep,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
32946149,Covid-19 and dengue: Double punches for dengue-endemic countries in Asia.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an international public health crisis with devastating effects. In particular, this pandemic has further exacerbated the burden in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, where dengue fever, caused by dengue virus (DENV), is already endemic to the population. The similar clinical manifestations shared by Covid-19 and dengue fever have raised concerns, especially in dengue-endemic countries with limited resources, leading to diagnostic challenges. In addition, cross-reactivity of the immune responses in these infections is an emerging concern, as pre-existing DENV-antibodies might potentially affect Covid-19 through antibody-dependent enhancement. In this review article, we aimed to raise the issue of Covid-19 and dengue fever misdiagnosis, not only in a clinical setting but also with regards to cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and DENV antibodies. We also have discussed the potential consequences of overlapping immunological cascades between dengue and Covid-19 on disease severity and vaccine development.","Harapan H, Ryan M, Yohan B, Abidin RS, Nainu F, Rakib A, Jahan I, Emran TB, Ullah I, Panta K, Dhama K, Sasmono RT",Rev Med Virol,2021 Mar,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia
35408618,Can the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Variant Confer Natural Immunity against COVID-19?,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is still ongoing, with no signs of abatement in sight. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the causative agent of this pandemic and has claimed over 5 million lives, is still mutating, resulting in numerous variants. One of the newest variants is Omicron, which shows an increase in its transmissibility, but also reportedly reduces hospitalization rates and shows milder symptoms, such as in those who have been vaccinated. As a result, many believe that Omicron provides a natural vaccination, which is the first step toward ending the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on published research and scientific evidence, we review and discuss how the end of this pandemic is predicted to occur as a result of Omicron variants being surpassed in the community. In light of the findings of our research, we believe that it is most likely true that the Omicron variant is a natural way of vaccinating the masses and slowing the spread of this deadly pandemic. While the mutation that causes the Omicron variant is encouraging, subsequent mutations do not guarantee that the disease it causes will be less severe. As the virus continues to evolve, humans must constantly adapt by increasing their immunity through vaccination.","Abas AH, Marfuah S, Idroes R, Kusumawaty D, Fatimawali, Park MN, Siyadatpanah A, Alhumaydhi FA, Mahmud S, Tallei TE, Emran TB, Kim B",Molecules,2022 Mar 29,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia

This study reports the characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Bali, Indonesia, and evaluates the diagnostic value of their clinical symptoms. METHOD: This observational study was conducted in eight hospitals. The patients were classified as non-severe COVID-19, severe COVID-19, and non-COVID-19. Demographics, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics, and outcomes of COVID-19 patients were collected. Factors associated with the severity and outcomes were assessed using the chi-squared test or ANOVA when appropriate. We also compared the clinical features of non-severe COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: This study included 92 patients: 41 non-COVID-19 and 51 COVID-19 patients, comprising 45 non-severe and six severe cases. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 were cough (47.1%), fever (31.0%), and dyspnea (25.3%). Cough, fatigue, and anosmia have high accuracy, and combining these complaints in clinical diagnostics offered a higher accuracy in predicting COVID-19 patients (60.1%). We found lower lymphocyte counts and interleukin-1R levels and higher levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and interleukin-8 in severe compared than in non-severe COVID-19 patients. Lactate dehydrogenase was associated with intensive care unit admission and ventilator use, while other markers such as neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 were not. CONCLUSION: A battery of symptoms, including cough, fatigue, and anosmia, is likely associated with COVID-19 in Bali. Clinicians should be aware of these symptoms to ensure a prompt diagnostic test for COVID-19, beyond other causes of acute febrile illnesses.","Masyeni S, Nelwan EJ, Fatawy RM, Wibawa S, Nugraha PA, Antara J, Suparta A, Asmara DGW, Yenny LGS, Budhitresna AAG, Arimas D, Indriani D, Parwata K, Sutarjana K, Sugiartha E, Kahari S, Wardhana CA, Indraningrat AAG, Mulyantari K, Pasek AW, Putrawan O, Yustiani NT, Wardana G, Wijaya MI, Aryana S, Gayatri Y, Sukmawati DD, Suastika K, Merati TP, Bakta M, Widiana R",PLoS One,2022,Acute Respiratory Infection AND Indonesia

In this study, we applied two Bayesian spatio-temporal conditional autoregressive (ST CAR) models, one of which allows discontinuities in risk between neighbouring areas (creating 'groups'), to examine dengue fever patterns. Data on annual (2002-2017) and monthly (January 2013 - December 2017) dengue cases and climatic factors over 14 geographic areas were obtained for Makassar, Indonesia. Combinations of covariates and model formulations were compared considering credible intervals, overall goodness of fit, and the grouping structure. For annual data, an ST CAR localised model incorporating average humidity provided the best fit, while for monthly data, a single-group ST CAR autoregressive model incorporating rainfall and average humidity was preferred. Using appropriate Bayesian spatio-temporal models enables identification of different groups of areas and the impact of climatic covariates which may help inform policy decisions.","Aswi A, Cramb S, Duncan E, Hu W, White G, Mengersen K",Spat Spatiotemporal Epidemiol,2020 Jun,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia

34107180,Efficacy of Wolbachia-Infected Mosquito Deployments for the Control of Dengue.,"BACKGROUND: Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with the wMel strain of Wolbachia pipientis are less susceptible than wild-type A. aegypti to dengue virus infection. METHODS: We conducted a cluster-randomized trial involving releases of wMel-infected A. aegypti mosquitoes for the control of dengue in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. We randomly assigned 12 geographic clusters to receive deployments of wMel-infected A. aegypti (intervention clusters) and 12 clusters to receive no deployments (control clusters). All clusters practiced local mosquito-control measures as usual. A test-negative design was used to assess the efficacy of the intervention. Patients with acute undifferentiated fever who presented to local primary care clinics and were 3 to 45 years of age were recruited. Laboratory testing was used to identify participants who had virologically confirmed dengue (VCD) and those who were test-negative controls. The primary end point was symptomatic VCD of any severity caused by any dengue virus serotype. RESULTS: After successful introgression of wMel into the intervention clusters, 8144 participants were enrolled; 3721 lived in intervention clusters, and 4423 lived in control clusters. In the intention-to-treat analysis, VCD occurred in 67 of 2905 participants (2.3%) in the intervention clusters and in 318 of 3401 (9.4%) in the control clusters (aggregate odds ratio for VCD, 0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15 to 0.35; P = 0.004). The protective efficacy of the intervention was 77.1% (95% CI, 65.3 to 84.9) and was similar against the four dengue virus serotypes. The incidence of hospitalization for VCD was lower among participants who lived in intervention clusters (13 of 2905 participants [0.4%]) than among those who lived in control clusters (102 of 3401 [3.0%]) (protective efficacy, 86.2%; 95% CI, 66.2 to 94.3). CONCLUSIONS: Introgression of wMel into A. aegypti populations was effective in reducing the incidence of symptomatic dengue and resulted in fewer hospitalizations for dengue among the participants.

We report the results of long-term follow-up interim analyses and integrated efficacy analyses. METHODS: We are assessing the incidence of hospitalization for virologically confirmed dengue as a surrogate safety end point during follow-up in years 3 to 6 of two phase 3 trials, CYD14 and CYD15, and a phase 2b trial, CYD23/57. We estimated vaccine efficacy using pooled data from the first 25 months of CYD14 and CYD15. RESULTS: Follow-up data were available for 10,165 of 10,275 participants (99%) in CYD14 and 19,898 of 20,869 participants (95%) in CYD15. Data were available for 3203 of the 4002 participants (80%) in the CYD23 trial included in CYD57. During year 3 in the CYD14, CYD15, and CYD57 trials combined, hospitalization for virologically confirmed dengue occurred in 65 of 22,177 participants in the vaccine group and 39 of 11,089 participants in the control group. Pooled relative risks of hospitalization for dengue were 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56 to 1.24) among all participants, 1.58 (95% CI, 0.83 to 3.02) among those under the age of 9 years, and 0.50 (95% CI, 0.29 to 0.86) among those 9 years of age or older. During year 3, hospitalization for severe dengue, as defined by the independent data monitoring committee criteria, occurred in 18 of 22,177 participants in the vaccine group and 6 of 11,089 participants in the control group. Pooled rates of efficacy for symptomatic dengue during the first 25 months were 60.3% (95% CI, 55.7 to 64.5) for all participants, 65.6% (95% CI, 60.7 to 69.9) for those 9 years of age or older, and 44.6% (95% CI, 31.6 to 55.0) for those younger than 9 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Although the unexplained higher incidence of hospitalization for dengue in year 3 among children younger than 9 years of age needs to be carefully monitored during long-term follow-up, the risk among children 2 to 16 years of age was lower in the vaccine group than in the control group.

A data set of confirmed dengue incidences collected in the province of West Java has allowed us to explore dengue's temporal trends and spatial distributions to obtain more obvious insights into its spatial-temporal evolution. We utilized the Richards model to estimate the growth rate and detect the peak (or turning point) of the dengue infection wave by identifying the temporal progression at each location. Using spatial analysis of geo-referenced data from a local perspective, we investigated the changes in the spatial clusters of dengue cases and detected hot spots and cold spots in each weekly cycle. We found that the trend of confirmed dengue incidences significantly increases from January to March. More than two-third (70.4%) of the regions in West Java had their dengue infection turning point ranging from the first week of January to the second week of March. This trend clearly coincides with the peak of precipitation level during the rainy season. Further, the spatial analysis identified the hot spots distributed across central, northern, northeastern, and southeastern regions in West Java. The densely populated areas were likewise seen to be associated with the high-risk areas of dengue exposure. Recognizing the peak of epidemic and geographical distribution of dengue cases might provide important insights that may help local authorities optimize their dengue prevention and intervention programs.","Fauzi IS, Nuraini N, Ayu RWS, Lestari BW",Heliyon,2022 Aug,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia

38798833,Cytokine profiles in dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever: A study from Indonesia.,"Recent studies have demonstrated that cytokine dysregulation has a critical role in the pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between tumor necrosis factor (TNF- alpha), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 10 (IL-10), and interleukin 17 (IL-17) with infection status, and severity of dengue. A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted at three hospitals in Gianyar regency and Denpasar municipality, Bali, Indonesia, from June to December 2022. Sixty-four dengue infected patients were involved. Patients' serum was tested for dengue infection using NS1 antigen rapid test, dengue virus immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) test, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Cytokine levels (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17) were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Infection status was determined by combining serological and RT-PCR results, categorizing patients into primary and secondary infections. The present study found that DF patients had lower TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-17 but higher IL-10 levels compared to DHF patients (p<0.001). Elevated TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-17 levels were higher in secondary infection, while IL-10 level was higher in primary infection (p<0.001). In conclusion, cytokines play a crucial role in the interplay between cytokine dysregulation and dengue infection dynamics.","Masyeni S, Wardhana IMW, Nainu F",Narra J,2024 Apr,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
31699941,The Threat of Emerging and Re-emerging Infections in Indonesia.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is one example of an emerging infection with total of 386 district of all province in Indonesia reported having such infection; with cumulative number of HIV infected patient from the year 1987 to 2014 is 150,296 while AIDS is 55,799 patients. The access to care only available for 153,887 patients among all HIV/AIDS patients of whom 70% are eligible for anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment and of these only half adhered to ARV treatment. In addition to that, there is an increased risk of other emerging diseases such as Zika virus, Monkey pox or Hanta pulmonary syndrome since a sporadic cases were reported around the region.Beside new diseases, tuberculosis, dengue virus, malaria and diphteria are continuously reported in Indonesia and classified as re-emerging illnesses. On this edition data on diphteria epidemiology in Indonesia will be shown by Karyanti et al.6 A recent outbreak of diphteria in Indonesia which involved almost all province in the country has led to a response named ORI (outbreak response of Immunization). Regardless of immunization, proper treatment including the distribution of anti-toxin and antibiotics are needed to stop the spread of this particular bacteria, further decreasing the mortality rate. In conclusion, the author of this paper mentioned that immunization gap needs to be handle systematically. Immunization data released on 2017 showed that complete immunization was given only to 20% of targeted group, while almost 75% were either unvaccinated or unknown. During the outbreak of diphteria in Indonesia, the WHO also reported several countries with similar problem such as Bangladesh, Haiti and Yamen. It was shown that a coordination between doctors in clinic/hospital with public health officer to conduct an epidemiological investigation, in conjunction with giving prophylaxis and assuring the logistics of anti-diphteria toxin and antibiotics were accessible were  the key of success in eliminating diphteria like it was in Bangladesh.Adherence to treatment are multifactorial for all illnesses. First, is the duration of treatment and the potential adverse event due to the medication. The Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia has support the early diagnosis of HIV and delivering treatment as soon as possible, in order to avoid transmission of the disease. Second, looking at another side of the story for HIV infected patients, receiving ARV treatment as a long life treatment could possibly cause an adverse event somewhere along the line. Budiman et.al reported factors that might contribute to liver injury. His study shows that measuring baseline liver function test AST routinely might minimize the toxicity of ARV to patients particularly with a low body mass index. Last, despite the adherence to treatment and procedures in minimizing the risk of adverse event to medication, we are now facing the primary resistance virus that transmitted in the community as mentioned by Megasari et al.8 on her report regarding the transmission of drug resistance HIV virus to naive patients in Bali.The Indonesian government through the Indonesian Ministry of Health has established a collaboration and one health approaches to tackle the threat of diseases in the country, particularly in infectious diseases.",Nelwan EJ,Acta Med Indones,2019 Jul,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
31154985,Correlation between Google Trends on dengue fever and national surveillance report in Indonesia.,"Background: Digital traces are rapidly used for health monitoring purposes in recent years. This approach is growing as the consequence of increased use of mobile phone, Internet, and machine learning. Many studies reported the use of Google Trends data as a potential data source to assist traditional surveillance systems. The rise of Internet penetration (54.7%) and the huge utilization of Google (98%) indicate the potential use of Google Trends in Indonesia. No study was performed to measure the correlation between country wide official dengue reports and Google Trends data in Indonesia. Objective: This study aims to measure the correlation between Google Trends data on dengue fever and the Indonesian national surveillance report. Methods: This research was a quantitative study using time series data (2012-2016). Two sets of data were analyzed using Moving Average analysis in Microsoft Excel. Pearson and Time lag correlations were also used to measure the correlation between those data. Results: Moving Average analysis showed that Google Trends data have a linear time series pattern with official dengue report. Pearson correlation indicated high correlation for three defined search terms with R-value range from 0.921 to 0.937 (p </= 0.05, overall period) which showed increasing trend in epidemic periods (2015-2016). Time lag correlation also indicated that Google Trends data can potentially be used for an early warning system and novel tool to monitor public reaction before the increase of dengue cases and during the outbreak. Conclusions: Google Trends data have a linear time series pattern and statistically correlated with annual official dengue reports. Identification of information-seeking behavior is needed to support the use of Google Trends for disease surveillance in Indonesia.","Husnayain A, Fuad A, Lazuardi L",Glob Health Action,2019,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
38597256,Wolbachia-carrying Aedes mosquitoes for preventing dengue infection.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue is a global health problem of high significance, with 3.9 billion people at risk of infection. The geographic expansion of dengue virus (DENV) infection has resulted in increased frequency and severity of the disease, and the number of deaths has increased in recent years. Wolbachia,an intracellular bacterial endosymbiont, has been under investigation for several years as a novel dengue-control strategy. Some dengue vectors (Aedes mosquitoes) can be transinfected with specific strains of Wolbachia, which decreases their fitness (ability to survive and mate) and their ability to reproduce, inhibiting the replication of dengue. Both laboratory and field studies have demonstrated the potential effect of Wolbachia deployments on reducing dengue transmission, and modelling studies have suggested that this may be a self-sustaining strategy for dengue prevention, although long-term effects are yet to be elucidated. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of Wolbachia-carrying Aedes speciesdeployments (specifically wMel-, wMelPop-, and wAlbB- strains of Wolbachia) for preventing dengue virus infection. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases, and two trial registries up to 24 January 2024. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster-randomized controlled trials (cRCTs), conducted in dengue endemic or epidemic-prone settings were eligible. We sought studies that investigated the impact of Wolbachia-carrying Aedes deployments on epidemiological or entomological dengue-related outcomes, utilizing either the population replacement or population suppression strategy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected eligible studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We used odds ratios (OR) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) as the effect measure for dichotomous outcomes. For count/rate outcomes, we planned to use the rate ratio with 95% CI as the effect measure. We used adjusted measures of effect for cRCTs. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: One completed cRCT met our inclusion criteria, and we identified two further ongoing cRCTs. The included trial was conducted in an urban setting in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. It utilized a nested test-negative study design, whereby all participants aged three to 45 years who presented at healthcare centres with a fever were enrolled in the study provided they had resided in the study area for the previous 10 nights. The trial showed that wMel-Wolbachia infected Ae aegypti deployments probably reduce the odds of contracting virologically confirmed dengue by 77% (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.35; 1 trial, 6306 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The cluster-level prevalence of wMel Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes remained high over two years in the intervention arm of the trial, reported as 95.8% (interquartile range 91.5 to 97.8) across 27 months in clusters receiving wMel-Wolbachia Ae aegypti deployments, but there were no reliable comparative data for this outcome. Other primary outcomes were the incidence of virologically confirmed dengue, the prevalence of dengue ribonucleic acid in the mosquito population, and mosquito density, but there were no data for these outcomes. Additionally, there were no data on adverse events. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The included trial demonstrates the potential significant impact of wMel-Wolbachia-carrying Ae aegypti mosquitoes on preventing dengue infection in an endemic setting, and supports evidence reported in non-randomized and uncontrolled studies. Further trials across a greater diversity of settings are required to confirm whether these findings apply to other locations and country settings, and greater reporting of acceptability and cost are important.","Fox T, Sguassero Y, Chaplin M, Rose W, Doum D, Arevalo-Rodriguez I, Villanueva G",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,2024 Apr 10,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
32370128,"Dengue Fever and Severe Dengue in Barbados, 2008-2016.","Analysis of the temporal, seasonal and demographic distribution of dengue virus (DENV) infections in Barbados was conducted using national surveillance data from a total of 3994 confirmed dengue cases. Diagnosis was confirmed either by DENV-specific real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), or non-structural protein 1 (NS1) antigen or enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests; a case fatality rate of 0.4% (10/3994) was observed. The prevalence rate of dengue fever (DF) varied from 27.5 to 453.9 cases per 100,000 population among febrile patients who sought medical attention annually. DF cases occurred throughout the year with low level of transmission observed during the dry season (December to June), then increased transmission during rainy season (July to November) peaking in October. Three major dengue epidemics occurred in Barbados during 2010, 2013 and possibly 2016 with an emerging three-year interval. DF prevalence rate among febrile patients who sought medical attention overall was highest among the 10-19 years old age group. The highest DF hospitalisation prevalence rate was observed in 2013. Multiple serotypes circulated during the study period and Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) was the most prevalent serotype during 2010, whilst DENV-1 was the most prevalent serotype in 2013. Two DENV-1 strains from the 2013 DENV epidemic were genetically more closely related to South East Asian strains, than Caribbean or South American strains, and represent the first ever sequencing of DENV strains in Barbados. However, the small sample size (n = 2) limits any meaningful conclusions. DF prevalence rates were not significantly different between females and males. Public health planning should consider DENV inter-epidemic periodicity, the current COVID-19 pandemic and similar clinical symptomology between DF and COVID-19. The implementation of routine sequencing of DENV strains to obtain critical data can aid in battling DENV epidemics in Barbados.","Douglas KO, Dutta SK, Martina B, Anfasa F, Samuels TA, Hilaire MG",Trop Med Infect Dis,2020 May 2,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
27905832,Dengue vaccine acceptance and willingness to pay.,"The introduction of new vaccines is accompanied by a variety of challenges. Among these, very important ones concern the questions whether the public is willing to accept and willing to purchase the vaccine. Here we discuss factors associated with these questions in the context of vaccines that are becoming available against dengue virus infection. We reviewed published studies available from PubMed and Embase, conducting a meta-analysis when possible and narrative review when the data did not qualify for meta-analysis. We found that attitude toward vaccination and socioeconomic level had significant associations with dengue vaccine acceptance. In addition, socioeconomic level, knowledge, attitude and practice regarding dengue fever, having personally experienced dengue fever and vaccine price were associated with willingness to pay for dengue vaccine. To improve acceptance and willingness to pay for dengue vaccine, well-designed introduction programs that address the associated factors in a context-specific manner are essential.","Harapan H, Fajar JK, Sasmono RT, Kuch U",Hum Vaccin Immunother,2017 Apr 3,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
31099110,Dengue viruses circulating in Indonesia: A systematic review and phylogenetic analysis of data from five decades.,"Although epidemiological and molecular epidemiological (serotype, genotype, and lineage information) data are available for several major cities in Indonesia, there is yet to be a comprehensive national study of dengue in Indonesia over time. This study was conducted to provide a comprehensive epidemiology of circulating dengue viruses (DENV) in Indonesia between 1973 and 2016. This was conducted through a systematic review of the literature and phylogenetic analysis of available DENV sequences. Available data from National Disease Surveillance System have indicated an increasing trend of dengue incidence in Indonesia over the past 50 years. Incidence rates appear to be cyclic, peaking approximately every 6 to 8 years. In contrast, the case fatality rate has decreased approximately by half with each decade since 1980. Over this 50-year time span, serotype shifts, genotype displacement within DENV-1 and DENV-2, and introduction of DENV-1 and DENV-3 genotype from other countries occurred. These events were associated with increased incidence of dengue cases. Our study also provides a valuable national snapshot of DENV genetic diversity in Indonesia that may contribute to development of more effective dengue vaccine compositions for the region.","Harapan H, Michie A, Yohan B, Shu PY, Mudatsir M, Sasmono RT, Imrie A",Rev Med Virol,2019 Jul,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
33706767,Assessment of dengue and COVID-19 antibody rapid diagnostic tests cross-reactivity in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains ongoing around the world, including in areas where dengue is endemic. Dengue and COVID-19, to some extent, have similar clinical and laboratory features, which can lead to misdiagnosis, delayed treatment and patient's isolation. The use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) is easy and convenient for fast diagnosis, however there may be issues with cross-reactivity with antibodies for other pathogens. METHODS: We assessed the possibility of cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and dengue antibodies by: (1) testing five brands of COVID-19 IgG / IgM RDTs on 60 RT-PCR-confirmed dengue samples; (2) testing 95 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 samples on dengue RDT; and (3) testing samples positive for COVID-19 IgG and/or IgM on dengue RDT. RESULTS: We observed a high specificity across all five brands of COVID-19 RDTs, ranging from 98.3 to 100%. Out of the confirmed COVID-19 samples, one patient tested positive for dengue IgM only, another tested positive for dengue IgG only. One patient tested positive for dengue IgG, IgM, and NS1, suggesting a co-infection. In COVID-19 IgG and/or IgM samples, 6.3% of COVID-19 IgG-positive samples also tested positive for dengue IgG, while 21.1% of COVID-19 IgM-positive samples also tested positive for dengue IgG. CONCLUSION: Despite the high specificity of the COVID-19 RDT, we observed cross-reactions and false-positive results between dengue and COVID-19. Dengue and COVID-19 co-infection was also found. Health practitioners in dengue endemic areas should be careful when using antibody RDT for the diagnosis of dengue during the COVID-19 pandemic to avoid misdiagnosis.","Santoso MS, Masyeni S, Haryanto S, Yohan B, Hibberd ML, Sasmono RT",Virol J,2021 Mar 11,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
38062404,Spatial model of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) risk: scoping review.,"BACKGROUND: Creating a spatial model of dengue fever risk is challenging duet to many interrelated factors that could affect dengue. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how these critical factors interact and to create reliable predictive models that can be used to mitigate and control the spread of dengue. METHODS: This scoping review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the important predictors, and spatial modelling tools capable of producing Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF) risk maps. We conducted a methodical exploration utilizing diverse sources, i.e., PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. The following data were extracted from articles published between January 2011 to August 2022: country, region, administrative level, type of scale, spatial model, dengue data use, and categories of predictors. Applying the eligibility criteria, 45 out of 1,349 articles were selected. RESULTS: A variety of models and techniques were used to identify DHF risk areas with an arrangement of various multiple-criteria decision-making, statistical, and machine learning technique. We found that there was no pattern of predictor use associated with particular approaches. Instead, a wide range of predictors was used to create the DHF risk maps. These predictors may include climatology factors (e.g., temperature, rainfall, humidity), epidemiological factors (population, demographics, socio-economic, previous DHF cases), environmental factors (land-use, elevation), and relevant factors. CONCLUSIONS: DHF risk spatial models are useful tools for detecting high-risk locations and driving proactive public health initiatives. Relying on geographical and environmental elements, these models ignored the impact of human behaviour and social dynamics. To improve the prediction accuracy, there is a need for a more comprehensive approach to understand DHF transmission dynamics.","Pakaya R, Daniel D, Widayani P, Utarini A",BMC Public Health,2023 Dec 7,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
28575000,"Clinical and virological characteristics of dengue in Surabaya, Indonesia.","Dengue disease is still a major health problem in Indonesia. Surabaya, the second largest city in the country, is endemic for dengue. We report here on dengue disease in Surabaya, investigating the clinical manifestations, the distribution of dengue virus (DENV) serotypes, and the relationships between clinical manifestations and the genetic characteristics of DENV. A total of 148 patients suspected of having dengue were recruited during February-August 2012. One hundred one (68%) of them were children, and 47 (32%) were adults. Dengue fever (DF) and Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) were equally manifested in all of the patients. We performed DENV serotyping on all of the samples using real-time RT-PCR. Of 148, 79 (53%) samples were detected as DENV positive, with DENV-1 as the predominant serotype (73%), followed by DENV-2 (8%), DENV-4 (8%), and DENV-3 (6%), while 5% were mixed infections. Based on the Envelope gene sequences, we performed phylogenetic analyses of 24 isolates to genotype the DENV circulating in Surabaya in 2012, and the analysis revealed that DENV-1 consisted of Genotypes I and IV, DENV-2 was of the Cosmopolitan genotype, the DENV-3 viruses were of Genotype I, and DENV-4 was detected as Genotype II. We correlated the infecting DENV serotypes with clinical manifestations and laboratory parameters; however, no significant correlations were found.

34383764,Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analyses of dengue vaccination in Indonesia.,"Despite the fact that the incidence and mortality rates due to dengue virus (DENV) infection in Indonesia are relatively high, dengue vaccination has not yet been introduced. This study aimed to analyse the cost-effectiveness and the budget impact of dengue vaccination in Indonesia by taking the potential of pre-vaccination screening into account. An age-structured decision tree model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness value by applying a single cohort of 4,710,100 children that was followed-up in a 10-year time horizon within a 1-year analytical cycle. The budget impact was analysed in a 5-year period (2020-2024) by considering provinces' readiness to introduce dengue vaccine and their incidence rate of DENV infection in the last 10 years. Vaccination that was coupled with pre-vaccination screening would reduce dengue fever (DF), dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) by 188,142, 148,089 and 426 cases, respectively. It would save treatment cost at $23,433,695 and $14,091,642 from the healthcare and payer perspective, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) would be $5,733 and $5,791 per quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) gained from both perspectives. The most influential parameters affecting the ICERs were probability of DENV infection, vaccine efficacy, under-reporting factor, vaccine price, case fatality rate and screening cost. It can be concluded that dengue vaccination and pre-vaccination screening would be cost-effective to be implemented in Indonesia. Nevertheless, it seems unaffordable to be implemented since the total required cost for the nationwide vaccination would be 94.44% of routine immunization budget.","Suwantika AA, Supadmi W, Ali M, Abdulah R",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,2021 Aug,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
33939642,Predictors and Outcomes of Dengue-Associated Acute Kidney Injury.,"Dengue viral infections present with a wide clinical spectrum ranging from asymptomatic to severe manifestations with organ involvement. The term ""expanded dengue syndrome"" has been commonly used to illustrate the unusual or atypical manifestations; acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the atypical manifestations of this syndrome. The use of heterogeneous criteria to determine the presence of AKI in dengue patients due to the vast diversity in populations led to difficulties in assessing the true incidence of dengue-associated AKI. This review presents a variable, but often high, frequency of dengue-associated AKI among vastly diverse populations with various disease severities. Dengue-associated AKI is not an uncommon complication, and its importance has often been neglected during the management of dengue patients. The risk factors and certain clinical and laboratory findings commonly reported among dengue patients with AKI should be considered to support a timely diagnosis and case management.

30092158,Ten-years trend of dengue research in Indonesia and South-east Asian countries: a bibliometric analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease with high incidence in over 128 countries. WHO estimates 500,000 people with severe dengue are hospitalized annually and 2.5% of those affected die. Indonesia is a hyperendemic country for dengue with an increasing number of cases in the last decade. Unfortunately, the trends of Indonesian dengue research are relatively unknown. OBJECTIVE: This research aimed to depict bibliographic trends and knowledge structure of dengue publications in Indonesia relative to that of South-east Asia (SEA) from 2007 to 2016. METHODS: Bibliographic data were collected from PubMed filtered by Indonesia country affiliation. The annual growth rate of publication was measured and compared with neighborhood countries in the SEA region. Network analysis was used to visualize emerging research issues. RESULTS: About 1,625 dengue-related documents originated from SEA region, of which Indonesia contributed 5.90%. The publication growth rate in Indonesia, however, is the highest in ASEAN region (28.87%). Total citations for documents published from Indonesia was 980, with an average of 14 citations per publication and h-index of 16. Within the first five years, the main research topics were related to insect vector and diagnostic method. While insect vector remained dominant in the last five years, other topics such as disease outbreak, dengue virus, and dengue vaccine started emerging. CONCLUSION: In the last 10 years, dengue publications' growth from Indonesia in international journals improved significantly, despite less number of publications compared to other SEA countries. Efforts should be made to improve the quantity and quality of publications from Indonesia. The research topics related to dengue in Indonesia are in line with studies in SEA. Stakeholders and policy makers are encouraged to develop a roadmap for dengue research in the future.","Maula AW, Fuad A, Utarini A",Glob Health Action,2018,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia

Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, reports dengue cases annually, with several outbreaks documented. To gain information on the dynamic and evolutionary history of dengue virus (DENV) in Jakarta, we conducted phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses of DENV isolated in 2009. Three hundred thirty-three dengue-suspected patients were recruited. Our data revealed that dengue predominantly affected young adults, and the majority of cases were due to secondary infection. A total of 171 virus isolates were successfully serotyped. All four DENV serotypes were circulating in the city, and DENV-1 was the predominant serotype. The DENV genotyping of 17 isolates revealed the presence of Genotypes I and IV in DENV-1, while DENV-2 isolates were grouped into the Cosmopolitan genotype. The grouping of isolates into Genotype I and II was seen for DENV-3 and DENV-4, respectively. Evolutionary analysis revealed the relatedness of Jakarta isolates with other isolates from other cities in Indonesia and isolates from imported cases in other countries. We revealed the endemicity of DENV and the role of Jakarta as the potential source of imported dengue cases in other countries. Our study provides genetic information regarding DENV from Jakarta, which will be useful for upstream applications, such as the study of DENV epidemiology and evolution and transmission dynamics.","Lestari CSW, Yohan B, Yunita A, Meutiawati F, Hayati RF, Trimarsanto H, Sasmono RT",Virus Genes,2017 Dec,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
27759344,Expanded Dengue.,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has coined the term expanded dengue to describe cases which do not fall into either dengue shock syndrome or dengue hemorrhagic fever. This has incorporated several atypical findings of dengue. Dengue virus has not been enlisted as a common etiological agent in several conditions like encephalitis, Guillain Barre syndrome. Moreover it is a great mimic of co-existing epidemics like Malaria, Chikungunya and Zika virus disease, which are also mosquito-borne diseases. The atypical manifestations noted in dengue can be mutisystemic and multifacetal. In clinical practice, the occurrence of atypical presentation should prompt us to investigate for dengue. Knowledge of expanded dengue helps to clinch the diagnosis of dengue early, especially during ongoing epidemics, avoiding further battery of investigations. Dengue has proved to be the epidemic with the ability to recur and has a diverse array of presentation as seen in large series from India, Srilanka, Indonesia and Taiwan. WHO has given the case definition of dengue fever in their comprehensive guidelines. Accordingly, a probable case is defined as acute febrile illness with two or more of any findings viz. headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, hemorrhagic manifestations, leucopenia and supportive serology. There have been cases of patients admitted with fever, altered mentation with or without neck stiffness and pyramidal tract signs. Some had seizures or status epilepticus as presentation. When they were tested for serology, dengue was positive. After ruling out other causes, dengue remained the only culprit. We have come across varied presentations of dengue fever in clinical practice and the present article throws light on atypical manifestations of dengue.","Kadam DB, Salvi S, Chandanwale A",J Assoc Physicians India,2016 Jul,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
29686179,The Autoimmune Mechanism in Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever.,"The immune response of dengue fever/dengue hemorrhagic fever is a series of immunopathogenesis processes starting from viral infection to the target on monocytes and macrophages. It may consequently cause a cascade of viremia in the circulation that stimulates the afferent, efferent, and effector mechanism by the interaction of the humoral and complement system. The cascade results in inflammatory substance that will affect capillary permeability and activate coagulation factors leading to further effects on endothelial level. The mechanism involving pathogenesis of DHF/DSS is still vague. So far, a theory of heterologous infection has been developed, which explains that on second infection, there is subneutralization that induce viral replication. The autoimmune mechanism development leads to the better understanding of DHF. It also  explains the autoimmune response of the viral infection, which consists of molecular mimicry, bystander activation and viral persistence. The development of the autoimmune pathomechanism is related to the role of  autoantibody and endothelial dysfunction that may have role in worsening DHF.","Lardo S, Soesatyo MH, Juffrie J, Umniyati SR",Acta Med Indones,2018 Jan,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia

However, evidence of the role of climate variability on VBD risk in Indonesia has not been adequately understood. We conducted a systematic literature review to collate and critically review studies on the relationship between climate variability and VBD in Indonesia. We searched articles on PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases that are published until December 2021. Studies that reported the relationship of climate and VBD, such as dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and malaria, were included. For the reporting, we followed the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. A total of 66 out of 284 studies were reviewed. Fifty-two (78.8%) papers investigated dengue, 13 (19.7%) papers studied malaria, one (1.5%) paper discussed chikungunya, and no (0%) paper reported on Zika. The studies were predominantly conducted in western Indonesian cities. Most studies have examined the short-term effect of climate variability on the incidence of VBD at national, sub-national, and local levels. Rainfall (n = 60/66; 90.9%), mean temperature (T(mean)) (n = 50/66; 75.8%), and relative humidity (RH) (n = 50/66; 75.8%) were the common climatic factors employed in the studies. The effect of climate on the incidence of VBD was heterogenous across locations. Only a few studies have investigated the long-term effects of climate on the distribution and incidence of VBD. The paucity of high-quality epidemiological data and variation in methodology are two major issues that limit the generalizability of evidence. A unified framework is required for future research to assess the impacts of climate on VBD in Indonesia to provide reliable evidence for better policymaking.","Marina R, Ariati J, Anwar A, Astuti EP, Dhewantara PW",Int J Biometeorol,2023 Jan,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia

CONCLUSIONS: The relative risk map and related factors of DF patients' survival can indicate the health policy makers to give special attention to the high risk areas in order to faster and more targeted treatment.","Thamrin SA, Aswi, Ansariadi, Jaya AK, Mengersen K",Gac Sanit,2021,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
32901596,"Cost of Dengue Illness in Indonesia across Hospital, Ambulatory, and not Medically Attended Settings.","Informed decisions concerning emerging technologies against dengue require knowledge about the disease's economic cost and each stakeholder's potential benefits from better control. To generate such data for Indonesia, we reviewed recent literature, analyzed expenditure and utilization data from two hospitals and two primary care facilities in Yogyakarta city, and interviewed 67 dengue patients from hospital, ambulatory, and not medically attended settings. We derived the cost of a dengue episode by outcome, setting, and the breakdown by payer. We then calculated aggregate Yogyakarta and national costs and 95% uncertainty intervals (95% UIs). Dengue costs per nonfatal case in hospital, ambulatory, not medically attended, and overall average settings were US$316.24 (95% UI: $242.30-$390.18), US$22.45 (95% UI: $14.12-$30.77), US$7.48 (95% UI: $2.36-$12.60), and US$50.41 (95% UI: $35.75-$65.07), respectively. Costs of nonfatal episodes were borne by the patient's household (37%), social contributors (relatives and friends, 20%), national health insurance (25%), and other sources (government, charity, and private insurance, 18%). After including fatal cases, the average cost per episode became $90.41 (95% UI: $72.79-$112.35). Indonesia had an estimated 7.535 (95% UI: 1.319-16.513) million dengue episodes in 2017, giving national aggregate costs of $681.26 (95% UI: $232.28-$2,371.56) million. Unlike most previous research that examined only the formal medical sector, this study included the estimated 63% of national dengue episodes that were not medically attended. Also, this study used actual costs, rather than charges, which generally understate dengue's economic burden in public facilities. Overall, this study found that Indonesia's aggregate cost of dengue was 73% higher than previously estimated, strengthening the need for effective control.","Wilastonegoro NN, Kharisma DD, Laksono IS, Halasa-Rappel YA, Brady OJ, Shepard DS",Am J Trop Med Hyg,2020 Nov,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
27215933,"The molecular and clinical features of dengue during outbreak in Jambi, Indonesia in 2015.","Dengue is hyperendemic in Indonesia. In 2015, reported cases of dengue fever doubled those of 2014 in the Jambi municipality of Sumatra. We examined viral aetiology and its relationship with disease outcome in Jambi. Dengue-suspected patients' sera were collected and NS1 detection and IgM/IgG serology were performed. Dengue virus (DENV) serotyping was performed using real-time RT-PCR. Envelope genes were sequenced to determine the genotypes of DENV. Clinical, haematologic, and demographic data were recorded. Of 210 dengue-suspected patients, 107 were confirmed. The disease manifested as Dengue Fever (62%), Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (36%), and Dengue Shock Syndrome (2%). The serotypes of 94 DENV were determined. All DENV serotypes were detected with DENV-1 as the predominant serotype (66%). Genotypically, the DENV-1 viruses belong to Genotype I, DENV-2 was of Cosmopolitan genotype, DENV-3 as Genotype I, and DENV-4 belonged to Genotype II. Comparison with historical data revealed serotype predominance switched from DENV-3 to DENV-1, and the replacement of Genotype IV of DENV-1 with Genotype I. In summary, DENV-1 predominated during the 2015 dengue outbreak in Jambi. The full spectrum of dengue disease occurred and was characterized by a switch in predominant serotypes.","Haryanto S, Hayati RF, Yohan B, Sijabat L, Sihite IF, Fahri S, Meutiawati F, Halim JA, Halim SN, Soebandrio A, Sasmono RT",Pathog Glob Health,2016 May,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
27208588,Dengue vaccine acceptance and associated factors in Indonesia: A community-based cross-sectional survey in Aceh.,"BACKGROUND: The first dengue vaccine (DV) has been licensed in some countries, but an assessment of the public's acceptance of DV is widely lacking. This study aimed to explore and understand DV acceptance and its associated explanatory variables among healthy inhabitants of Aceh, Indonesia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted from November 2014 to March 2015 in nine regencies of Aceh that were selected randomly. A set of validated questionnaires covering a range of explanatory variables and DV acceptance was used to conduct the interviews. A multi-step logistic regression analysis and Spearman's rank correlation were employed to assess the role of explanatory variables in DV acceptance. RESULTS: We included 652 community members in the final analysis and found that 77.3% of them were willing to accept the DV. Gender, monthly income, socioeconomic status (SES), attitude toward dengue fever (DF) and attitude toward vaccination practice were associated with DV acceptance in bivariate analyses (P<0.05). A correlation analysis confirmed that attitude toward vaccination practice and attitude toward DF were strongly correlated with DV acceptance, rs=0.41 and rs=0.39, respectively (P<0.001). The multivariate analysis revealed that a high monthly income, high SES, and a good attitude toward vaccination practice and toward DF were independent predictors of DV acceptance. CONCLUSION: The acceptance rate of the DV among inhabitants of Aceh, Indonesia was relatively high, and the strongest associated factors of higher support for the DV were a good attitude toward vaccination practices and a good attitude toward DF.","Harapan H, Anwar S, Setiawan AM, Sasmono RT",Vaccine,2016 Jul 12,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia

31136953,"Using dengue epidemics and local weather in Bali, Indonesia to predict imported dengue in Australia.","BACKGROUND: Although the association between dengue in Bali, Indonesia, and imported dengue in Australia has been widely asserted, no study has quantified this association so far. METHODS: Monthly data on dengue and climatic factors over the past decade for Bali and Jakarta as well as monthly data on imported dengue in Australia underwent a three-stage analysis. Stage I: a quasi-Poisson regression with distributed lag non-linear model was used to assess the associations of climatic factors with dengue in Bali. Stage II: a generalized additive model was used to quantify the association of dengue in Bali with imported dengue in Australia with and without including the number of travelers in log scale as an offset. Stage III: the associations of mean temperature and rainfall (two climatic factors identified in stage I) in Bali with imported dengue in Australia were examined using stage I approach. RESULTS: The number of dengue cases in Bali increased with increasing mean temperature, and, up to a certain level, it also increased with increasing rainfall but dropped off for high levels of rainfall. Above a monthly incidence of 1.05 cases per 100,000, dengue in Bali was almost linearly associated with imported dengue in Australia at a lag of one month. Mean temperature (relative risk (RR) per 0.5  degrees C increase: 2.95, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.87, 4.66) and rainfall (RR per 7.5 mm increase: 3.42, 95% CI: 1.07, 10.92) in Bali were significantly associated with imported dengue in Australia at a lag of four months. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that climatic factors (i.e., mean temperature and rainfall) known to be conducive of dengue transmission in Bali can provide an early warning with 4-month lead time for Australia in order to mitigate future outbreaks of local dengue in Australia. This study also provides a template and framework for future surveillance of travel-related infectious diseases globally.","Xu Z, Bambrick H, Yakob L, Devine G, Frentiu FD, Marina R, Dhewantara PW, Nusa R, Sasmono RT, Hu W",Environ Res,2019 Aug,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
38313186,Non-structural protein 1 and hematology parameters as predictors of dengue virus infection severity in Indonesia.,"Dengue virus infection (DVI) remains a significant health challenge, and diagnosis must still be considered. Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a potential marker of the dengue virus that can help diagnose DVI. The study aimed to assess the role of NS1 as a predictor of the severity of DVI. We utilized Dengue PCR-confirmed samples and employed semi-quantitative NS1Ag ELISA for NS1 examination, adhering to the World Health Organization South-East Asia Region (WHO-SEARO) 2011 criteria for DVI. We included DVI patients from Indonesia aged 1-65 years. Secondary infections had more severe clinical conditions than primary infections. Leukocyte and platelet levels had a more significant effect on NS1 positivity (6.19 (1.9-30.2); p<0.001; 190 (11-417); p=0.015; respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed leukocytes as a more significant predictor of NS1 values than platelets, with an odds ratio of 5.38 contributing to 30.5% of the NS1 value variation. The NS1 value could distinguish undifferentiated fever and dengue fever in the children group with a sensitivity of 76.0% and specificity of 87.5% (p=0.015). The number of NS1(-) in the severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) group was higher than NS1(+). DENV-4 type and primary infection were dominant in this study, although they did not significantly differ from the NS1 value. NS1 value can be used as a predictor to determine the severity of DVI in children but not in the adult group. The levels of leukocytes and platelets influenced the NS1 value.","Sunari IGAAEP, Aryati A, Hakim FKN, Tanzilia MF, Zuroidah N, Wrahatnala BJ, Rohman A, Wardhani P, Husada D, Miftahussurur M",J Med Life,2023 Oct,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
39066210,Unraveling Dengue Virus Diversity in Asia: An Epidemiological Study through Genetic Sequences and Phylogenetic Analysis.,"Dengue virus (DENV) is the causative agent of dengue. Although most infected individuals are asymptomatic or present with only mild symptoms, severe manifestations could potentially devastate human populations in tropical and subtropical regions. In hyperendemic regions such as South Asia and Southeast Asia (SEA), all four DENV serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4) have been prevalent for several decades. Each DENV serotype is further divided into multiple genotypes, reflecting the extensive diversity of DENV. Historically, specific DENV genotypes were associated with particular geographical distributions within endemic regions. However, this epidemiological pattern has changed due to urbanization, globalization, and climate change. This review comprehensively traces the historical and recent genetic epidemiology of DENV in Asia from the first time DENV was identified in the 1950s to the present. We analyzed envelope sequences from a database covering 16 endemic countries across three distinct geographic regions in Asia. These countries included Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka from South Asia; Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam from Mainland SEA; and Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Singapore from Maritime SEA. Additionally, we describe the phylogenetic relationships among DENV genotypes within each serotype, along with their geographic distribution, to enhance the understanding of DENV dynamics.","Phadungsombat J, Nakayama EE, Shioda T",Viruses,2024 Jun 28,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
31370291,"A Review of Hantavirus Research in Indonesia: Prevalence in Humans and Rodents, and the Discovery of Serang Virus.","Dengue and other common tropical infectious diseases of similar clinical presentation are endemic in Indonesia, which may lead to an underestimation of the prevalence of hantavirus (HTV) infection in the country. To better understand the current burden of HTV infection, this study aimed to both identify acute HTV infection among hospitalized patients with fever and to determine the overall seroprevalence of HTV. These results were further considered within the context of previously reported HTV infection in humans and animals in Indonesia by conducting a review of published literature. As part of an observational cohort study of acute febrile illness, this sub-study retrospectively analyzed blood specimens obtained during admission, during the 2-4-week convalescent period, and three months after admission. Convalescent specimens from patients with clinical signs and symptoms of HTV infection were first screened for HTV IgG. When positive, convalescent specimens and paired acute specimens were screened for HTV IgM, and paired acute specimens were tested for HTV by Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). A literature review of HTV in Indonesia was conducted on manuscripts manually reviewed for relevance after identification from a search using the terms ""hantavirus/Seoul virus"" and ""Indonesia"". From patients at eight hospitals in seven provincial capitals, HTV IgG seroprevalence was 11.6% (38/327), with the highest being in Denpasar (16.3%, 7/43) and the lowest being in Yogyakarta (3.4%, 1/31). Anti-HTV IgG was most prevalent in adults (13.5%, 33/244) and males (15.6%, 29/186). Acute HTV infections were identified in two subjects, both of whom had Seoul virus. In Indonesia, HTVs have been studied in humans and animals since 1984. Over the past 35 years, the reported seroprevalences in rodents ranged from 0% to 34%, and in humans from 0% to 13%. Fourteen acute infections have been reported, including one in a tourist returning to Germany, but only two have been confirmed by RT-PCR. Almost all rodent and human surveillance results demonstrated serological and molecular evidence of Seoul virus infection. However, in Semarang, anti-Puumala virus IgM has been detected in humans and Puumala RNA in one rodent. In Serang, a new virus named Serang virus was identified due to its differences from Seoul virus. In Maumere, HTV and Leptospira spp. were identified simultaneously in rodents. The burden of HTV infection in Indonesia is underestimated, and additional studies are needed to understand the true prevalence. Seroprevalence data reported here, previous observations of HTV co-infections in rodents, and the prevalence of rodent-borne bacterial infections in Indonesia suggest that the population may be routinely encountering HTVs. While Seoul virus appears to be the most prevalent HTV in the country, further studies are needed to understand which HTVs are circulating.","Lukman N, Kosasih H, Ibrahim IN, Pradana AA, Neal A, Karyana M",Viruses,2019 Jul 31,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
38696416,"Discrepancies in dengue burden estimates: a comparative analysis of reported cases and global burden of disease study, 2010-2019.","BACKGROUND: Dengue is a significant mosquito-borne disease. Several studies have utilized estimates from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study to assess the global, regional or national burden of dengue over time. However, our recent investigation suggests that GBD's estimates for dengue cases in Taiwan are unrealistically high. The current study extends the scope to compare reported dengue cases with GBD estimates across 30 high-burden countries and territories, aiming to assess the accuracy and interpretability of the GBD's dengue estimates. METHODS: Data for this study were sourced from the GBD 2019 study and various national and international databases documenting reported dengue cases. The analysis targeted the top 30 countries and territories with the highest 10-year average of reported cases from 2010 to 2019. Discrepancies were quantified by computing absolute differences and ratios between the 10-year average of reported cases and GBD estimates. Coefficients of variation (CV) and estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) were calculated to assess variations and trends in the two data sources. RESULTS: Significant discrepancies were noted between reported data and GBD estimates in the number of dengue cases, incidence rates, and EAPCs. GBD estimates were substantially higher than reported cases for many entities, with the most notable differences found in China (570.0-fold), India (303.0-fold), Bangladesh (115.4-fold), Taiwan (85.5-fold) and Indonesia (23.2-fold). Furthermore, the GBD's estimates did not accurately reflect the extensive yearly fluctuations in dengue outbreaks, particularly in non-endemic regions such as Taiwan, China and Argentina, as evidenced by high CVs. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals substantial discrepancies between GBD estimates and reported dengue cases, underscoring the imperative for comprehensive analysis in areas with pronounced disparities. The failure of GBD estimates to represent the considerable annual fluctuations in dengue outbreaks highlights the critical need for improvement in disease burden estimation methodologies for dengue.","Lee SY, Shih HI, Lo WC, Lu TH, Chien YW",J Travel Med,2024 Jun 3,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
464191,Epidemic dengue hemorrhagic fever in rural Indonesia. I.

Dengue virus was isolated from the acute sera of 45 of 69 patients (65%). The isolation rate was higher in primary than secondary cases. Dengue 3 was the predominant serotype being transmitted (27 isolates), but both dengue 1 (8 isolates) and dengue 4 (10 isolates) were also being transmitted. A composite picture of magnitude and duration of viremia showed that many patients were circulating over 10(8) MID50 per milliliter dengue 3 virus for the first 3 days of illness and that viremia persisted for 5-6 days in some persons. If all shock cases were considered, there was no relationship between dengue serotype and severity of disease.

30333266,Early Detection of Plasma Leakage in Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever.,"Dengue viral infection remains a major public health problem. As many as 400 million people are infected yearly. Even though the vaccine is available, the use of dengue vaccine is still limited due to some concerns. Among patient infected with dengue viral infection, early recognition of the virus and prompt supportive treatment are important to avoid complication and mortality.The clinical spectrum of dengue viral infection is diverse ranging from undifferentiated fever to dengue shock syndrome characterized by plasma leak and hemoconcentration. No specific antiviral therapy is available. Therefore, anticipation of complication should be performed adequately.The most dangerous complication of dengue infection is shock syndrome. Hypothetically the occurrence of shock is a result of secondary viral infection. The manifestation of increased vascular permeability and low intravascular volume lead to the development of shock. In addition to that, another complex mechanism underlies the occurrence of shock such as endothelial dysfunction that could happened abruptly. No specific method exists to identify this condition as early as possible.During dengue infection, fever can be last between 2 and 7 days. The localized plasma leakage could happen and manifested as a pleural effusion fluid accumulation in abdominal cavity or hemoconcentration. This will only last for 48 hours and will be resolved later spontaneously. Severity of leakage varies among patients and the unanticipated of leakage due to failure to recognize and treat this manifestation related to mortality.Most of the fatal cases of dengue are related to late detection of the illness as shown by massive hemorrhage and severe intravascular volume depletion. The role of dendritic cells is as the initiator of immune response that facilitate virus uptake. On the other hand, the non-neutralize cross reactive antibodies will increase virus uptake and resulted in more viral replication. Some studies showed higher NS1 protein were found in patients with more severe disease. In addition to that antibody to NS1 could bind to the endothelial cells and lead to apoptosis of these cells. Both host and viral factors contribute to the severity of the illness.One of the important factors for dengue viral infection is the capacity of clinicians to identify the risk factors for shock. Studies reported that female, infants, elderly, patients with concomitant diseases are prone to have more severe infection. Virus serotype and genetic susceptibility may also contribute but the evidence is still limited. So, those are not sensitive enough be used in clinical setting.Besides those, after the diagnosis of with dengue infection based on WHO criteria and confirmation by serology detection or viral material in the blood, no specific sign and symptoms are available to determine any potential severity. There were studies performed to monitor the plasma leakage using mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) instead of hematocrit values. Rapid intervention can be administered by monitoring MAP to avoid deleterious consequences.The classification of WHO 1997 or 2009 were not able to detect the plasma leakage earlier. Nainggolan et al presented the resulted of their observation among early dengue infection which was the occurrence of gallbladder wall thickening as a manifestation of plasma leakage. Ultrasonographic measurement is valuable and applicable to detect plasma leakage in earlier phase with positive likelihood ratio 2.14 (95% CI 1.12 - 4.12). Similar report from Indonesia also showed the role of ultrasonography in dengue.",Nelwan EJ,Acta Med Indones,2018 Jul,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
36745606,Dengue incidence and length of viremia by RT-PCR in a prospective observational community contact cluster study from 2005-2009 in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue has become a major global health threat since being recognized three centuries ago. Important gaps remain in understanding the transmission dynamics of dengue virus (DENV) infection. This study reports the results of a prospective observational cluster study that investigated the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections and length of viremia among close community contacts of hospitalized DENV-infected patients. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Between 2005 and 2009, dengue-confirmed cases (n = 97) admitted to Hasan Sadikin Hospital in Bandung, Indonesia, were enrolled as index cases. Subsequently, twenty close community contacts (n = 1928) living with and around the index cases were included and followed up for up to 14 days. Body temperature was measured daily; blood samples were collected every 3-4 days and when reported fever. DENV infection was confirmed using Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), IgM rapid test, and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Among the 1928 community contacts, a total of 72 (3.7%) acute DENV infections were diagnosed, which equates to an incidence of 636 cases per 1,000 person-years (95% Confidence interval (CI) 588 to 687 cases per 1,000 person-years). Twenty-nine cases (40%) were symptomatic (22 dengue fever (DF) & 7 dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)), and 43 (60%) were asymptomatic. Primary and secondary DENV infections were detected in 18 (25%) and 54 (75%) subjects. Among the RT-PCR positives, viremia was observed as early as seven days before fever onset and converted to negative as late as seven days after the onset of fever. CONCLUSIONS: DENV infections are common among close community contacts of hospitalized dengue patients. The high number of asymptomatic infections and the observation that viremia precedes the onset of fever for up to seven days highlight the importance of unrecognized dengue transmission and the need for improved transmission control.","Riswari SF, Velies DS, Lukman N, Jaya UA, Djauhari H, Ma'roef CN, Myint KSA, Widjaja S, der Ven AV, Alisjahbana B, Mast Q, Kosasih H",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,2023 Feb,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
30629593,Economic burden of dengue in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue is associated with significant economic expenditure and it is estimated that the Asia Pacific region accounts for >50% of the global cost. Indonesia has one of the world's highest dengue burdens; Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are the primary and secondary vectors. In the absence of local data on disease cost, this study estimated the annual economic burden during 2015 of both hospitalized and ambulatory dengue cases in Indonesia. METHODS: Total 2015 dengue costs were calculated using both prospective and retrospective methods using data from public and private hospitals and health centres in three provinces: Yogyakarta, Bali and Jakarta. Direct costs were extracted from billing systems and claims; a patient survey captured indirect and out-of-pocket costs at discharge and 2 weeks later. Adjustments across sites based on similar clinical practices and healthcare landscapes were performed to fill gaps in cost estimates. The national burden of dengue was extrapolated from provincial data using data from the three sites and applying an empirically-derived epidemiological expansion factor. RESULTS: Total direct and indirect costs per dengue case assessed at Yogyakarta, Bali and Jakarta were US$791, US$1,241 and US$1,250, respectively. Total 2015 economic burden of dengue in Indonesia was estimated at US$381.15 million which comprised US$355.2 million for hospitalized and US$26.2 million for ambulatory care cases. CONCLUSION: Dengue imposes a substantial economic burden for Indonesian public payers and society. Complemented with an appropriate weighting method and by accounting for local specificities and practices, these data may support national level public health decision making for prevention/control of dengue in public health priority lists.","Nadjib M, Setiawan E, Putri S, Nealon J, Beucher S, Hadinegoro SR, Permanasari VY, Sari K, Wahyono TYM, Kristin E, Wirawan DN, Thabrany H",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,2019 Jan,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
25784569,"Genomic analysis and growth characteristic of dengue viruses from Makassar, Indonesia.","Dengue fever is currently the most important mosquito-borne viral disease in Indonesia. In South Sulawesi province, most regions report dengue cases including the capital city, Makassar. Currently, no information is available on the serotypes and genotypes of the viruses circulating in the area. To understand the dynamic of dengue disease in Makassar, we carried out dengue fever surveillance study during 2007-2010. A total of 455 patients were recruited, in which antigen and serological detection revealed the confirmed dengue cases in 43.3% of patients. Molecular detection confirmed the dengue cases in 27.7% of patients, demonstrating that dengue places a significant disease burden on the community. Serotyping revealed that dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1) was the most predominant serotype, followed by DENV-2, -3, and -4. To determine the molecular evolution of the viruses, we conducted whole-genome sequencing of 80 isolates. Phylogenetic analysis grouped DENV-2, -3 and -4 to the Cosmopolitan genotype, Genotype I and Genotype II, respectively. Intriguingly, each serotype paints a different picture of evolution and transmission. DENV-1 appears to be undergoing a clade replacement with Genotype IV being supplanted by Genotype I. The Cosmopolitan DENV-2 isolates were found to be regionally endemic and is frequently being exchanged between countries in the region. By contrast, DENV-3 and DENV-4 isolates were related to strains with a long history in Indonesia although the DENV-3 strains appear to have been following a distinct evolutionary path since approximately 1998. To assess whether the various DENV serotypes/genotypes possess different growth characteristics, we performed growth kinetic assays on selected viruses. We observed the relatively higher rate of replication for DENV-1 and -2 compared to DENV-3 and -4. Within the DENV-1, viruses from Genotype I grow faster than that of Genotype IV. This higher replication rate may underlie their ability to replace the circulation of Genotype IV in the community.","Sasmono RT, Wahid I, Trimarsanto H, Yohan B, Wahyuni S, Hertanto M, Yusuf I, Mubin H, Ganda IJ, Latief R, Bifani PJ, Shi PY, Schreiber MJ",Infect Genet Evol,2015 Jun,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
31601215,Carica papaya extract in dengue: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Carica papaya (CP) extract is becoming popular as an unlicensed herbal remedy purported to hasten recovery in dengue infection, mostly based on observations that it may increase platelet counts. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to critically analyze the evidence from controlled clinical trials on the efficacy and safety of CP extract in the treatment of dengue infection. METHODS: PubMed, LILACS and Google Scholar were searched for randomized or non-randomized trials enrolling patients with suspected or confirmed dengue where CP extract was compared, as a treatment measure, against standard treatment. Recovery of platelet counts as well as other clinical indicators of favourable outcome (duration of hospital stay, prevention of plasma leakage, life threatening complications, and mortality) were assessed. RESULTS: Nine studies (India-6, Pakistan-1, Indonesia-1, Malaysia-1) met the inclusion criteria. Seven studies showed an increase in platelet counts in patients receiving CP extract, while one study showed no significant difference between the two groups, and direct comparison was not possible in the remaining study. Serious adverse events were not reported. CP extract may reduce the duration of hospital stay (mean difference - 1.98 days, 95% confidence interval - 1.83 to - 2.12, 3 studies, 580 participants, low quality evidence), and cause improvement in mean platelet counts between the first and fifth day of treatment (mean difference 35.45, 95% confidence interval 23.74 to 47.15, 3 studies, 129 participants, low quality evidence). No evidence was available regarding other clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical value of improvement in platelet count or early discharge is unclear in the absence of more robust indicators of favourable clinical outcome. Current evidence is insufficient to comment on the role of CP extract in dengue. There is a need for further well designed clinical trials examining the effect of CP on platelet counts, plasma leakage, other serious manifestations of dengue, and mortality, with clearly defined outcome measures.","Rajapakse S, de Silva NL, Weeratunga P, Rodrigo C, Sigera C, Fernando SD",BMC Complement Altern Med,2019 Oct 11,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia

CONCLUSION: It was found that two variables had a significant association between temperature and humidity on the prevalence of DHF in Manado Municipality based on observations of patterns of temperature and humidity characteristics every month during 2019.","Monintja TCN, Arsin AA, Amiruddin R, Syafar M",Gac Sanit,2021,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
33733650,"Geographical heterogeneity and socio-ecological risk profiles of dengue in Jakarta, Indonesia.","The aim of this study was to assess the role of climate variability on the incidence of dengue fever (DF), an endemic arboviral infection existing in Jakarta, Indonesia. The work carried out included analysis of the spatial distribution of confirmed DF cases from January 2007 to December 2018 characterising the sociodemographical and ecological factors in DF high-risk areas. Spearman's rank correlation was used to examine the relationship between DF incidence and climatic factors. Spatial clustering and hotspots of DF were examined using global Moran's I statistic and the local indicator for spatial association analysis. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was performed to compare and identify demographical and socio-ecological characteristics of the identified hotspots and low-risk clusters. The seasonality of DF incidence was correlated with precipitation (r=0.254, P<0.01), humidity (r=0.340, P<0.01), dipole mode index (r= -0.459, P<0.01) and Tmin (r= -0.181, P<0.05). DF incidence was spatially clustered at the village level (I=0.294, P<0.001) and 22 hotspots were identified with a concentration in the central and eastern parts of Jakarta. CART analysis showed that age and occupation were the most important factors explaining DF clustering. Areaspecific and population-targeted interventions are needed to improve the situation among those living in the identified DF high-risk areas in Jakarta.","Prasetyowati H, Dhewantara PW, Hendri J, Astuti EP, Gelaw YA, Harapan H, Ipa M, Widyastuti W, Handayani DOTL, Salama N, Picasso M",Geospat Health,2021 Mar 12,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
35549884,"The knowledge, attitude and practice of community people on dengue fever in Central Nepal: a cross-sectional study.","BACKGROUND: Since 2006, Nepal has experienced frequent Dengue fever (DF) outbreaks. Up to now, there have been no knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) studies carried out on DF in Nepal that have included qualitative in-depth and quantitative data. Thus, we aimed to explore and compare the KAP of people residing in the lowland (< 1500 m) and highland (> 1500 m) areas of Nepal. METHODS: A cross-sectional mixed-method study was conducted in six districts of central Nepal in September-October 2018 including both quantitative (660 household surveys) and qualitative data (12 focus group discussions and 27 in-depth interviews). The KAP assessment was executed using a scoring system and defined as high or low based on 80% cut-off point. Logistic regression was used to investigate the associated factors, in quantitative analysis. The deductive followed by inductive approach was adopted to identify the themes in the qualitative data. RESULTS: The study revealed that both the awareness about DF and prevention measures were low. Among the surveyed participants, 40.6% had previously heard about DF with a significantly higher number in the lowland areas. Similarly, IDI and FGD participants from the lowland areas were aware about DF, and it's associated symptoms, hence they were adopting better preventive practices against DF. The findings of both the qualitative and quantitative data indicate that people residing in the lowland areas had better knowledge on DF compared to people in highland areas. All IDI participants perceived a higher chance of increasing future dengue outbreaks due to increasing temperature and the mobility of infected people from endemic to non-endemic areas. The most quoted sources of information were the television (71.8%) and radio (51.5%). Overall, only 2.3% of the HHS participants obtained high knowledge scores, 74.1% obtained high attitude scores and 21.2% obtained high preventive practice scores on DF. Among the socio-demographic variables, the area of residence, educational level, age, monthly income, SES and occupation were independent predictors of knowledge level, while the education level of the participants was an independent predictor of the attitude level. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found a very low level of knowledge and insufficient preventive practices. This highlights an urgent need for extensive dengue prevention programs in both highland and lowland communities of Nepal.","Phuyal P, Kramer IM, Kuch U, Magdeburg A, Groneberg DA, Lamichhane Dhimal M, Montag D, Harapan H, Wouters E, Jha AK, Dhimal M, Muller R",BMC Infect Dis,2022 May 12,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
31634352,"Dengue viral infection in Indonesia: Epidemiology, diagnostic challenges, and mutations from an observational cohort study.","BACKGROUND: Dengue virus (DENV) infection is a major cause of acute febrile illness in Indonesia. Diagnostic inaccuracy may occur due to its varied and non-specific presentation. Characterization of DENV epidemiology, clinical presentation, and virology will facilitate appropriate clinical management and public health policy. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A multicenter observational cohort study was conducted in Indonesia to assess causes of acute fever requiring hospitalization. Clinical information and specimens were collected at enrollment, 14-28 days, and 3 months from 1,486 children and adults. Total of 468 (31.9%) cases of DENV infection were confirmed by reference laboratory assays. Of these, 414 (88.5%) were accurately diagnosed and 54 had been misdiagnosed as another infection by sites. One hundred initially suspected dengue cases were finally classified as 'non-dengue'; other pathogens were identified in 58 of those cases. Mortality of DENV infection was low (0.6%). Prior DENV exposure was found in 92.3% of subjects >12 years. DENV circulated year-round in all cities, with higher incidence from January to March. DENV-3 and DENV-1 were the predominant serotypes. This study identified DENV-1 with TS119(C-->T) substitution in the serotyping primer annealing site, leading to failure of serotype determination. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: DENV is a common etiology of acute febrile illness requiring hospitalization in Indonesia. Diagnostic accuracy at clinical sites merits optimization since misdiagnosis of DENV infection and over-estimation of dengue can negatively impact management and outcomes. Mutation at the annealing site of the serotyping primer may confound diagnosis. Clinicians should consider following diagnostic algorithms that include DENV confirmatory testing. Policy-makers should prioritize development of laboratory capacity for diagnosis of DENV.","Utama IMS, Lukman N, Sukmawati DD, Alisjahbana B, Alam A, Murniati D, Utama IMGDL, Puspitasari D, Kosasih H, Laksono I, Karyana M, Karyanti MR, Hapsari MMDEAH, Meutia N, Liang CJ, Wulan WN, Lau CY, Parwati KTM",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,2019 Oct,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia

23437406,Economic and disease burden of dengue in Southeast Asia.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue poses a substantial economic and disease burden in Southeast Asia (SEA). Quantifying this burden is critical to set policy priorities and disease-control strategies. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We estimated the economic and disease burden of dengue in 12 countries in SEA: Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, East-Timor, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam. We obtained reported cases from multiple sources--surveillance data, World Health Organization (WHO), and published studies--and adjusted for underreporting using expansion factors from previous literature. We obtained unit costs per episode through a systematic literature review, and completed missing data using linear regressions. We excluded costs such as prevention and vector control, and long-term sequelae of dengue. Over the decade of 2001-2010, we obtained an annual average of 2.9 million (m) dengue episodes and 5,906 deaths. The annual economic burden (with 95% certainty levels) was US$950m (US$610m-US$1,384m) or about US$1.65 (US$1.06-US$2.41) per capita. The annual number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), based on the original 1994 definition, was 214,000 (120,000-299,000), which is equivalent to 372 (210-520) DALYs per million inhabitants. CONCLUSION: Dengue poses a substantial economic and disease burden in SEA with a DALY burden per million inhabitants in the region. This burden is higher than that of 17 other conditions, including Japanese encephalitis, upper respiratory infections, and hepatitis B.","Shepard DS, Undurraga EA, Halasa YA",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,2013,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
32479497,Chikungunya in Indonesia: Epidemiology and diagnostic challenges.,"BACKGROUND: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is often overlooked as an etiology of fever in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Lack of diagnostic testing capacity in these areas combined with co-circulation of clinically similar pathogens such as dengue virus (DENV), hinders CHIKV diagnosis. To better address CHIKV in Indonesia, an improved understanding of epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnostic approaches is needed. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Acutely hospitalized febrile patients >/=1-year-old were enrolled in a multi-site observational cohort study conducted in Indonesia from 2013 to 2016. Demographic and clinical data were collected at enrollment; blood specimens were collected at enrollment, once during days 14 to 28, and three months after enrollment. Plasma samples negative for DENV by serology and/or molecular assays were screened for evidence of acute CHIKV infection (ACI) by serology and molecular assays. To address the co-infection of DENV and CHIKV, DENV cases were selected randomly to be screened for evidence of ACI. ACI was confirmed in 40/1,089 (3.7%) screened subjects, all of whom were DENV negative. All 40 cases initially received other diagnoses, most commonly dengue fever, typhoid fever, and leptospirosis. ACI was found at five of the seven study cities, though evidence of prior CHIKV exposure was observed in 25.2% to 45.9% of subjects across sites. All subjects were assessed during hospitalization as mildly or moderately ill, consistent with the Asian genotype of CHIKV. Subjects with ACI had clinical presentations that overlapped with other common syndromes, atypical manifestations of disease, or persistent or false-positive IgM against Salmonella Typhi. Two of the 40 cases were possibly secondary ACI. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: CHIKV remains an underdiagnosed acute febrile illness in Indonesia. Public health measures should support development of CHIKV diagnostic capacity. Improved access to point-of-care diagnostic tests and clinical training on presentations of ACI will facilitate appropriate case management such as avoiding unneccessary treatments or antibiotics, early response to control mosquito population and eventually reducing disease transmission.","Arif M, Tauran P, Kosasih H, Pelupessy NM, Sennang N, Mubin RH, Sudarmono P, Tjitra E, Murniati D, Alam A, Gasem MH, Aman AT, Lokida D, Hadi U, Parwati KTM, Lau CY, Neal A, Karyana M",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,2020 Jun,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
35062303,"Co-Circulation of Chikungunya and Multiple DENV Serotypes and Genotypes, Western Indonesia 2015-2016.","Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease of public health concern affecting tropical and subtropical countries, including Indonesia. Although studies on dengue epidemiology have been undertaken in Indonesia, data are lacking in many areas of the country. The aim of this study was to determine dengue virus (DENV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) molecular epidemiology in western regions of the Indonesian archipelago. A one-year prospective study was conducted in Aceh and Jambi in 2015 and 2016, respectively, where patients with dengue-like illness were enrolled. Of 205 patients recruited, 29 and 27 were confirmed with dengue in Aceh and Jambi, respectively, and three from Jambi were confirmed with chikungunya. DENV-1 was the predominant serotype identified in Aceh while DENV-2 was predominant in Jambi. All DENV-1 and DENV-2 from both regions were classified as Genotype I and Cosmopolitan genotype, respectively, and all DENV-3 viruses from Jambi were Genotype I. Some viruses, in particular DENV-1, displayed a distinct lineage distribution, where two DENV-1 lineages from Aceh were more closely related to viruses from China instead of Jambi highlighting the role of travel and flight patterns on DENV transmission in the region. DENV-2 from both Aceh and Jambi and DENV-3 from Jambi were all closely related to Indonesian local strains. All three CHIKV belonged to Asian genotype and clustered closely with Indonesian CHIKV strains including those previously circulating in Jambi in 2015, confirming continuous and sustainable transmission of CHIKV in the region. The study results emphasize the importance of continuous epidemiological surveillance of arboviruses in Indonesia and simultaneous testing for CHIKV among dengue-suspected patients.","Harapan H, Michie A, Ernst T, Panta K, Mudatsir M, Yohan B, Haryanto S, McCarthy S, Sasmono RT, Imrie A",Viruses,2022 Jan 6,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
35282645,A Comparison of the Accuracy of Handheld Hemoglobinometer and Hematocrit Measurements for Detecting Plasma Leakage in Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever.,"PURPOSE: Practical methods for detecting plasma leakage should be readily available in all areas where dengue is endemic. We compared the accuracy of measurements obtained with a handheld HemoCue((R)) Hb 201 instrument used for hemoglobin point-of-care testing (Hb-POCT) with that of measurements of hematocrit (Ht) levels for detecting plasma leakage in dengue patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed both measurements using the HemoCue((R)) Hb201 system and microhematocrit method on EDTA blood taken from dengue patients at three time points during their hospitalization. Ascites, pleural effusion, or gallbladder thickening determined through ultrasound examinations were considered the gold standard for determining dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) versus dengue fever (DF). RESULTS: Close agreement between Hb-POCT and Ht measurements was indicated by an r square value of 0.845 in a linear regression. The sensitivity results for distinguishing between DHF and DF at admission were similar for Hb-POCT (63.6%) and Ht (66.7%) (Kappa = 0.75) using the optimal cutoff point determined via ROC analysis. Delta differences (in percentage) for Hb-POCT and Ht between the highest and lowest values showed lower sensitivity (45.5% and 48.5%, respectively; Kappa 0.60) when the optimal cutoff point was applied. Recommended cutoffs of >/=20% to confirm plasma leakage provided a slightly higher sensitivity using Hb-POCT (18.2%) compared with the sensitivity obtained using Ht (15.2%) with Kappa value of 97.9%. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that the accuracy of Hb POCT measurements was similar and not inferior to Ht measurements for detecting plasma leakage in patients with DHF. We recommend that further evaluations are conducted to determine the optimal cutoff point given the low sensitivity associated with using >/=20% Hb-POCT or Ht increases to determine hemoconcentration.","Riswari SF, Budiman MF, Darmayanti D, Ernawati, Prodjosoewojo S, Susandi E, Oehadian A, Alisjahbana B",Int J Gen Med,2022,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
35644356,"Dengue virus population genetics in Yogyakarta, Indonesia prior to city-wide Wolbachia deployment.","Dengue has been endemic in Yogyakarta, Indonesia for decades. Here, we report the dengue epidemiology, entomology, and virology in Yogyakarta in 2016-2017, prior to the commencement of the Applying Wolbachia to Eliminate Dengue (AWED) randomized trial. Dengue epidemiological data were compiled and blood samples from dengue-suspected patients were tested for dengue virus (DENV). Ae. aegypti mosquito samples were caught from the field using BG-Sentinel traps and tested for the presence of DENV infection. Sequencing of the DENV E gene was used to determine the phylogeny and genotypes of circulating DENV. Within the last decade, the 2016-2017 dengue incidence was considered very high. Among the 649 plasma samples collected between March 2016-February 2017; and 36,910 mosquito samples collected between December 2016-May 2017, a total of 197 and 38 samples were DENV-positive by qRT-PCR, respectively. All four DENV serotypes were detected, with DENV-3 (n = 88; 44.67%) and DENV-1 (n = 87; 44.16%) as the predominant serotype, followed by DENV-4 (n = 12; 6.09%) and DENV-2 (n = 10; 5.08%). The Yogyakarta DENV-1 isolates were classified into Genotype I and IV, while DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 isolates were classified into the Cosmopolitan genotype, Genotype I, and Genotype II, respectively. Yogyakarta DENV isolates were closely related to Indonesian strains from neighboring Javanese cities, consistent with the endemic circulation of DENV on this highly populous island. Our study provides comprehensive baseline information on the DENV population genetic characteristics in Yogyakarta, which are useful as baseline data for the AWED trial and the future DENV surveillance in the city in the presence of a Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti population.","Arguni E, Indriani C, Rahayu A, Supriyati E, Yohan B, Hayati RF, Wardana S, Tantowijoyo W, Anshari MR, Rahayu E, Rubangi, Ahmad RA, Utarini A, Simmons CP, Sasmono RT",Infect Genet Evol,2022 Aug,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
28531223,Dengue in Bali: Clinical characteristics and genetic diversity of circulating dengue viruses.,"A high number of dengue cases are reported annually in Bali. Despite the endemicity, limited data on dengue is available for Bali localities. Molecular surveillance study was conducted to explore the clinical and virological characteristics of dengue patients in urban Denpasar and rural Gianyar areas in Bali during the peak season in 2015. A total of 205 adult dengue-suspected patients were recruited in a prospective cross-sectional study. Demographic and clinical information were obtained, and dengue screening was performed using NS1 and IgM/IgG ELISAs. Viral RNA was subsequently extracted from patients' sera for serotyping using conventional RT-PCR and Simplexa Dengue real-time RT-PCR, followed by genotyping with sequencing method. We confirmed 161 patients as having dengue by NS1 and RT-PCR. Among 154 samples successfully serotyped, the DENV-3 was predominant, followed by DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-4. Serotype predominance was different between Denpasar and Gianyar. Genotyping results classify DENV-1 isolates into Genotype I and DENV-2 as Cosmopolitan Genotype. The classification grouped isolates into Genotype I and II for DENV-3 and DENV-4, respectively. Clinical parameters showed no relationship between infecting serotypes and severity. We observed the genetic diversity of circulating DENV isolates and their relatedness with historical data and importation to other countries.

29016291,"Chikungunya Detection during Dengue Outbreak in Sumatra, Indonesia: Clinical Manifestations and Virological Profile.","Chikungunya fever (CHIK) is an acute viral infection caused by infection with chikungunya virus (CHIKV). The disease affects people in areas where certain Aedes species mosquito vectors are present, especially in tropical and subtropical countries. Indonesia has witnessed CHIK disease since the early 1970s with sporadic outbreaks occurring throughout the year. The CHIK clinical manifestation, characterized by fever, headache, and joint pain, is similar to that of dengue (DEN) disease. During a molecular study of a DEN outbreak in Jambi, Sumatra, in early 2015, DENV-negative samples were evaluated for evidence of CHIKV infection. Among 103 DENV-negative samples, eight samples were confirmed (7.8%) as positive for CHIKV by both molecular detection and virus isolation. The mean age of the CHIK patients was 21.3 +/- 9.1 (range 11-35 years). The clinical manifestations of the CHIK patients were mild and mimicked DEN, with fever and headache as the main symptoms. Only three out of eight patients presented with classical joint pain. Sequencing of the envelope glycoprotein E1 gene and phylogenetic analysis identified all CHIKV isolates as belonging to the Asian genotype. Overall, our study confirms sustained endemic CHIKV transmission and the presence of multiple arboviruses circulating during a DEN outbreak in Indonesia. The co-circulation of arboviruses poses a public health threat and is likely to cause misdiagnosis and underreporting of CHIK in DEN-endemic areas such as Indonesia.","Sasmono RT, Perkasa A, Yohan B, Haryanto S, Yudhaputri FA, Hayati RF, Ma'roef CN, Ledermann JP, Aye Myint KS, Powers AM",Am J Trop Med Hyg,2017 Nov,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
32545688,Cost-Effectiveness of Dengue Vaccination in Indonesia: Considering Integrated Programs with Wolbachia-Infected Mosquitos and Health Education.,"Despite the fact that morbidity and mortality rates due to dengue infection in Indonesia are relatively high, a dengue vaccination has not yet been introduced. Next to vaccination, Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes and health education have been considered to be potential interventions to prevent dengue infection in Indonesia. This study was aimed to analyse the cost-effectiveness of dengue vaccination in Indonesia whilst taking Wolbachia and health education programs into account. An age-structured decision tree model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness. Approximately 4,701,100 children were followed-up in a 10-year time horizon within a 1-year analytical cycle. We compared three vaccination strategies: one focussing on vaccination only, another combining vaccination and a Wolbachia program, and a third scenario combining vaccination and health education. All scenarios were compared with a no-intervention strategy. The result showed that only vaccination would reduce dengue fever (DF), dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) by 123,203; 97,140 and 283 cases, respectively. It would save treatment cost at $10.3 million and $6.2 million from the healthcare and payer perspectives, respectively. The combination of vaccination and a Wolbachia program would reduce DF, DHF and DSS by 292,488; 230,541; and 672 cases, respectively. It would also save treatment cost at $24.3 million and $14.6 million from the healthcare and payer perspectives, respectively. The combination of vaccination and health education would reduce DF, DHF, and DSS by 187,986; 148,220; and 432 cases, respectively. It would save treatment cost at $15.6 million and $9.4 million from the healthcare and payer perspectives, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) from the healthcare perspective were estimated to be $9,995, $4,460, and $6,399 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for the respective scenarios. ICERs from the payer perspective were slightly higher. It can be concluded that vaccination combined with a Wolbachia program was confirmed to be the most cost-effective intervention. Dengue infection rate, vaccine efficacy, cost of Wolbachia program, underreporting factor for hospitalization, vaccine price and mortality rate were considered to be the most influential parameters affecting the ICERs.","Suwantika AA, Kautsar AP, Supadmi W, Zakiyah N, Abdulah R, Ali M, Postma MJ",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2020 Jun 12,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia

39634916,Coinfection With SARS-CoV-2 and Dengue Virus: A Case Report Highlighting Diagnostic Challenges.,"BACKGROUND: Since its emergence in China, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 240 million people worldwide, including in regions where dengue virus (DENV) is hyperendemic such as Latin America and Southeast Asia, including Indonesia. Diagnosis of COVID-19 in dengue endemic regions as well as DENV and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection can be challenging. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a 68-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus type II who was admitted to the Tangerang District Hospital on 14 April 2020. She lived in a neighborhood where a few people were contracting dengue fever. She presented with five days of fever, malaise, anorexia, nausea, myalgia, and arthralgia. Hematology revealed anemia, thrombocytopenia, normal leukocyte count, increased neutrophil proportion, and decreased lymphocyte proportion and absolute lymphocytes. Her chest X-ray showed right pericardial infiltrates. Although dengue was clinically suspected, she was also tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection as she met screening criteria. After being confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive by RT-PCR, she was treated with ceftriaxone, paracetamol, azithromycin, oseltamivir, and chloroquine. She was clinically improved four days later and discharged from the hospital on 25 April 2020 after SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was negative on two consecutive samples. Dengue was diagnosed retrospectively based on sero-conversion of dengue IgM and a very high dengue IgG index (ELISA, Focus Diagnostics((R)), Cypress, CA, USA), and sero-conversion of dengue IgM and positive IgG (Rapid test, PanBio ((R))Dengue duo cassette, Inverness Medical Innovations, QLD, AU), which was equivalent to high Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) antibody titer (>/=1280) found in secondary dengue infection. CONCLUSION: The overlapping clinical presentations of COVID-19 and dengue; limited diagnostic capacity of laboratories in resource constrained settings; and complexities of interpreting results make identification of COVID-19 in the dengue endemic setting challenging. Clinicians in endemic areas must be aware of diagnostic challenges and maintain a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 coinfection with DENV and other tropical pathogens.","Hariadi P, Lokida D, Naysilla AM, Lukman N, Kosasih H, Mardian Y, Andru G, Pertiwi I, Sugiyono RI, Pradana AA, Salim G, Butar-Butar DP, Lau CY, Karyana M",Front Trop Dis,2022 Feb,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia

We discovered 642 papers between 2018 and 2023. Articles derived from reviews, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses were among the exclusion criteria in this study. In contrast, original studies, English-language publications, and open access were the inclusion criteria. The results indicate that the management of trash and the prevention of dengue disease are closely related. In order to accomplish integrated urban waste management for the prevention of dengue fever, local governments must understand the community's concerns, preferences, knowledge, and behaviour and involve them in the process of providing municipal trash infrastructure.","Ruhardi A, Mahmudah M, Azizah R",Afr J Reprod Health,2024 Oct 31,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
24195519,Cost of dengue outbreaks: literature review and country case studies.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue disease surveillance and vector surveillance are presumed to detect dengue outbreaks at an early stage and to save--through early response activities--resources, and reduce the social and economic impact of outbreaks on individuals, health systems and economies. The aim of this study is to unveil evidence on the cost of dengue outbreaks. METHODS: Economic evidence on dengue outbreaks was gathered by conducting a literature review and collecting information on the costs of recent dengue outbreaks in 4 countries: Peru, Dominican Republic, Vietnam, and Indonesia. The literature review distinguished between costs of dengue illness including cost of dengue outbreaks, cost of interventions and cost-effectiveness of interventions. RESULTS: Seventeen publications on cost of dengue showed a large range of costs from 0.2 Million US$ in Venezuela to 135.2 Million US$ in Brazil. However, these figures were not standardized to make them comparable. Furthermore, dengue outbreak costs are calculated differently across the publications, and cost of dengue illness is used interchangeably with cost of dengue outbreaks. Only one paper from Australia analysed the resources saved through active dengue surveillance. Costs of vector control interventions have been reported in 4 studies, indicating that the costs of such interventions are lower than those of actual outbreaks. Nine papers focussed on the cost-effectiveness of dengue vaccines or dengue vector control; they do not provide any direct information on cost of dengue outbreaks, but their modelling methodologies could guide future research on cost-effectiveness of national surveillance systems.The country case studies--conducted in very different geographic and health system settings - unveiled rough estimates for 2011 outbreak costs of: 12 million US$ in Vietnam, 6.75 million US$ in Indonesia, 4.5 million US$ in Peru and 2.8 million US$ in Dominican Republic (all in 2012 US$). The proportions of the different cost components (vector control; surveillance; information, education and communication; direct medical and indirect costs), as percentage of total costs, differed across the respective countries. Resources used for dengue disease control and treatment were country specific. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence so far collected further confirms the methodological challenges in this field: 1) to define technically dengue outbreaks (what do we measure?) and 2) to measure accurately the costs in prospective field studies (how do we measure?). Currently, consensus on the technical definition of an outbreak is sought through the International Research Consortium on Dengue Risk Assessment, Management and Surveillance (IDAMS). Best practice guidelines should be further developed, also to improve the quality and comparability of cost study findings. Modelling the costs of dengue outbreaks and validating these models through field studies should guide further research.","Stahl HC, Butenschoen VM, Tran HT, Gozzer E, Skewes R, Mahendradhata Y, Runge-Ranzinger S, Kroeger A, Farlow A",BMC Public Health,2013 Nov 6,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
27908746,"Willingness to pay for a dengue vaccine and its associated determinants in Indonesia: A community-based, cross-sectional survey in Aceh.","Vaccination strategies are being considered as a part of dengue prevention programs in endemic countries. To accelerate the introduction of dengue vaccine into the public sector program and private markets, understanding the private economic benefits of a dengue vaccine is therefore essential. The aim of this study was to assess the willingness to pay (WTP) for a dengue vaccine among community members in Indonesia and its associated explanatory variables. A community-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted in nine regencies of Aceh province, Indonesia, from November 2014 to March 2015. A pre-tested validated questionnaire was used to facilitate the interviews. To assess the explanatory variables influencing participants' WTP for a dengue vaccine, a linear regression analysis was employed. We interviewed 677 healthy community members; 476 participants (87.5% of the total) were included in the final analysis. An average individual was willing to pay around US-$ 4 (mean: US-$ 4.04; median: US-$ 3.97) for a dengue vaccine. Our final multivariate model revealed that working as a civil servant, living in the city, and having good knowledge on dengue viruses, a good attitude towards dengue, and good preventive practice against dengue virus infection were associated with a higher WTP (P<0.05). Our model suggests that marketing efforts should be directed to community members who are working in the suburbs especially as farmers. In addition, the results of our study underscore the need for low-cost quality vaccines, public sector subsidies for vaccinations, and intensifying efforts to further educate and encourage households regarding other dengue preventive measures, using trusted individuals as facilitators.","Harapan H, Anwar S, Bustamam A, Radiansyah A, Angraini P, Fasli R, Salwiyadi S, Bastian RA, Oktiviyari A, Akmal I, Iqbalamin M, Adil J, Henrizal F, Darmayanti D, Mahmuda M, Mudatsir M, Imrie A, Sasmono RT, Kuch U, Shkedy Z, Pramana S",Acta Trop,2017 Feb,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
34097704,Worldwide dynamic biogeography of zoonotic and anthroponotic dengue.,"Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes. The rapid spread of dengue could lead to a global pandemic, and so the geographical extent of this spread needs to be assessed and predicted. There are also reasons to suggest that transmission of dengue from non-human primates in tropical forest cycles is being underestimated. We investigate the fine-scale geographic changes in transmission risk since the late 20th century, and take into account for the first time the potential role that primate biogeography and sylvatic vectors play in increasing the disease transmission risk. We apply a biogeographic framework to the most recent global dataset of dengue cases. Temporally stratified models describing favorable areas for vector presence and for disease transmission are combined. Our models were validated for predictive capacity, and point to a significant broadening of vector presence in tropical and non-tropical areas globally. We show that dengue transmission is likely to spread to affected areas in China, Papua New Guinea, Australia, USA, Colombia, Venezuela, Madagascar, as well as to cities in Europe and Japan. These models also suggest that dengue transmission is likely to spread to regions where there are presently no or very few reports of occurrence. According to our results, sylvatic dengue cycles account for a small percentage of the global extent of the human case record, but could be increasing in relevance in Asia, Africa, and South America. The spatial distribution of factors favoring transmission risk in different regions of the world allows for distinct management strategies to be prepared.","Aliaga-Samanez A, Cobos-Mayo M, Real R, Segura M, Romero D, Fa JE, Olivero J",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,2021 Jun,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
29486714,"Knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding dengue virus infection among inhabitants of Aceh, Indonesia: a cross-sectional study.","BACKGROUND: The Indonesian region of Aceh was the area most severely affected by the earthquake and tsunami of 26 December 2004. Department of Health data reveal an upward trend of dengue cases in Aceh since the events of the tsunami. Despite the increasing incidence of dengue in the region, there is limited understanding of dengue among the general population of Aceh. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) regarding dengue among the people of Aceh, Indonesia in order to design intervention strategies for an effective dengue prevention program. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Aceh between November 2014 and March 2015 with a total of 609 participants living in seven regencies and two municipalities. Information on the socio-demographic characteristics of participants and their KAP regarding dengue was collected using a pre-tested structured questionnaire. The KAP status (good vs. poor) of participants with different socio-demographic characteristics was compared using Chi Square-test, ANOVA or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the predictors of each KAP domain. RESULTS: We found that 45% of participants had good knowledge regarding dengue and only 32% had good attitudes and good dengue preventive practices. There was a significant positive correlation between knowledge and attitudes, knowledge and practice, and attitudes and practice. In addition, people who had good knowledge were 2.7 times more likely to have good attitudes, and people who had good attitudes were 2.2 times more likely to have good practices regarding dengue. The level of education, occupation, marital status, monthly income, socioeconomic status (SES) and living in the city were associated with the knowledge level. Occupation, SES, and having experienced dengue fever were associated with attitudes. Education, occupation, SES and type of residence were associated with preventive practices.

33115680,Serological cross-reaction and coinfection of dengue and COVID-19 in Asia: Experience from Indonesia.,"Similar symptoms and laboratory findings between dengue and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pose a diagnostic challenge in some dengue-endemic countries in Asia. In this study, we reported three cases of suspected COVID-19-dengue coinfection in hospitals of Bali, Indonesia. Serological data demonstrated that patients with positive results for dengue virus (DENV) NS1 antigen and anti-dengue IgM were also reactive to COVID-19 rapid antibody tests, suggesting dengue-COVID-19 coinfection. However, two patients were later confirmed negative for SARS-COV-2 by qRT-PCR, implying a plausible cross-reactivity of anti-dengue and anti-COVID-19 antibodies in the serological test. Coinfection of dengue and COVID-19 was evident in one patient, following confirmation of SARS-COV-2 by qRT-PCR and DENV infection using the NS1 antigen serology test. This case was the first case of dengue and COVID-19 coinfection in Indonesia and revealed possible cross-reactivity between SARS-COV-2 and DENV antibodies based on rapid serological tests. Our study indicates a public health concern regarding COVID-19 and dengue detection in Indonesia as well as in other dengue-endemic countries, and it is important for these nations to manage both pathogens concurrently.","Masyeni S, Santoso MS, Widyaningsih PD, Asmara DW, Nainu F, Harapan H, Sasmono RT",Int J Infect Dis,2021 Jan,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
36533754,"The effects of climate factors, population density, and vector density on the incidence of dengue hemorrhagic fever in South Jakarta Administrative City 2016-2020: an ecological study.","BACKGROUND AND AIM: Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is an infectious disease caused by the dengue virus (DENV) and is transmitted through the bite of the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. This study aims to analyze the relationship between the incidence of DHF which can be influenced by climatic factors in the same month (non-time lag), climatic factors with a lag of 1 month (time lag 1), climatic factors with a lag of 2 months (time lag 2), population density, and vector density. METHODS: The study design used is an ecological study. The data is sourced from the South Jakarta City Administration of Health, the South Jakarta City Administration of Central Statistics, and the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency. Data were analyzed using correlation test. RESULTS: The results showed that the incidence of DHF was related to non-time lag rainfall, time lag 1, and time lag 2, air temperature time lag 2, air humidity non-time lag, time lag 1, and time lag 2, population density, and numbers of mosquito's larvae free index (ABJ). CONCLUSIONS: DHF is still a disease that needs to be watched out for in the South Jakarta Administrative City, requiring the government and the people of the South Jakarta Administration to continue to increase efforts to prevent and control DHF.","Amelinda YS, Wulandari RA, Asyary A",Acta Biomed,2022 Dec 16,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
16507313,"Four dengue virus serotypes found circulating during an outbreak of dengue fever and dengue haemorrhagic fever in Jakarta, Indonesia, during 2004.","Periodic outbreaks of dengue have emerged in Indonesia since 1968, with the severity of resulting disease increasing in subsequent years. In early 2004, a purported dengue outbreak erupted across the archipelago, with over 50,000 cases and 603 deaths reported. To confirm the disease aetiology and to provide an epidemiological framework of this epidemic, an investigation was conducted in ten hospitals within the capital city of Jakarta. Clinical and laboratory findings were determined from a cohort of 272 hospitalised patients. Exposure to dengue virus was determined in 180 (66.2%) patients. When clinically assessed, 100 (55.6%) of the 180 patients were classified as having dengue fever (DF), 31 (17.2%) as DF with haemorrhagic manifestations and 49 (27.2%) as dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF). Evidence from haemagglutination inhibition assays suggested that 33/40 (82.5%) of those with DHF from which laboratory evidence was available suffered from a secondary dengue infection. All four dengue viruses were identified upon viral isolation, with DEN-3 being the most predominant serotype recovered, followed by DEN-4, DEN-2 and DEN-1. In summary, the 2004 outbreak of dengue in Jakarta, Indonesia, was characterised by the circulation of multiple virus serotypes and resulted in a relatively high percentage of a representative population of hospitalised patients developing DHF.","Suwandono A, Kosasih H, Nurhayati, Kusriastuti R, Harun S, Ma'roef C, Wuryadi S, Herianto B, Yuwono D, Porter KR, Beckett CG, Blair PJ",Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,2006 Sep,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
30113689,"Dengue infection in international travellers visiting Bali, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: Dengue, an acute febrile illness caused by infection with dengue virus (DENV), is endemic in Bali, Indonesia. As one of the world's most popular tourist destinations, Bali is regularly visited by domestic and international travellers, who are prone to infection by endemic pathogens, including DENV. Currently, limited data are available on the characteristics of dengue in travellers visiting Bali. Information on the epidemiology and virological aspects of dengue in these tourists is important to gain a better understanding of the dengue disease in international travellers. METHODS: We performed a prospective cross-sectional dengue study involving foreign travellers visiting Bali, Indonesia in the period of 2015-17. Patients presenting at Kasih Ibu Hospital with fever and clinical symptoms of dengue were asked to participate in the study. Clinical and laboratory assessments were performed and sera were collected for molecular analysis, which included DENV serotyping, genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Among the 201 patients recruited, dengue was confirmed in 133 (66.2%) of them, based on detection of NS1 antigen and/or viral RNA. Of these, 115 (86.5%) manifested dengue fever (DF) and 18 (13.5%) dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF). The temporal predominance of infecting DENV serotype was DENV-2 (48.7%), followed by DENV-3 (36.1%), DENV-1 (9.2%) and DENV-4 (3.4%). Phylogenetic analysis of DENV based on envelope gene sequences revealed that the source of DENVs was local endemic viruses. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms that dengue is one of the causes of fever in travellers visiting Bali. Although it is a cause of significant morbidity, the majority of patients only experienced mild DF, with only a small proportion developing DHF. We revealed that DENVs isolated were autochthonous. Accurate diagnosis, preventive measures and continuous disease surveillance will be useful for better management of dengue infection in travellers.","Masyeni S, Yohan B, Somia IKA, Myint KSA, Sasmono RT",J Travel Med,2018 Aug 1,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
34607402,Dengue and COVID-19 infections in the ASEAN region: a concurrent outbreak of viral diseases.,"Member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have faced dengue outbreaks for decades, and the region has one of the highest rates of dengue globally. Outbreaks continue to occur concurrently with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the 10 ASEAN countries. Both infectious diseases pose a tremendous burden in these countries related to both infection control and the economy. Increases in the number of dengue cases occurred in part due to disruptions in the pathogen-host-vector relationship caused by changes in human behaviour in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The spread of dengue was further aggravated by the implementation of lockdowns and social distancing policies. These measures limited the coverage of dengue preventive programs and delayed the medical management of both diseases due to co-infection and misdiagnosis. It is of the utmost importance for the population to remain aware of both diseases, and dengue vector control strategies must be devised to properly address outbreaks using digitalization and remote surveillance. Similarly, critical triage algorithms and further research are also needed to combat co-infection and misdiagnosis. Controlling the spread of COVID-19 though vaccination should also be undertaken to reduce the impact of the pandemic.","Wiyono L, Rocha ICN, Cedeno TDD, Miranda AV, Lucero-Prisno Iii DE",Epidemiol Health,2021,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
31495336,Estimating the burden of dengue and the impact of release of wMel Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes in Indonesia: a modelling study.,"BACKGROUND: Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes reduce dengue virus transmission, and city-wide releases in Yogyakarta city, Indonesia, are showing promising entomological results. Accurate estimates of the burden of dengue, its spatial distribution and the potential impact of Wolbachia are critical in guiding funder and government decisions on its future wider use. METHODS: Here, we combine multiple modelling methods for burden estimation to predict national case burden disaggregated by severity and map the distribution of burden across the country using three separate data sources. An ensemble of transmission models then predicts the estimated reduction in dengue transmission following a nationwide roll-out of wMel Wolbachia. RESULTS: We estimate that 7.8 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1.8-17.7 million) symptomatic dengue cases occurred in Indonesia in 2015 and were associated with 332,865 (UI 94,175-754,203) lost disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The majority of dengue's burden was due to non-severe cases that did not seek treatment or were challenging to diagnose in outpatient settings leading to substantial underreporting. Estimated burden was highly concentrated in a small number of large cities with 90% of dengue cases occurring in 15.3% of land area. Implementing a nationwide Wolbachia population replacement programme was estimated to avert 86.2% (UI 36.2-99.9%) of cases over a long-term average. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest interventions targeted to the highest burden cities can have a disproportionate impact on dengue burden. Area-wide interventions, such as Wolbachia, that are deployed based on the area covered could protect people more efficiently than individual-based interventions, such as vaccines, in such dense environments.","O'Reilly KM, Hendrickx E, Kharisma DD, Wilastonegoro NN, Carrington LB, Elyazar IRF, Kucharski AJ, Lowe R, Flasche S, Pigott DM, Reiner RC Jr, Edmunds WJ, Hay SI, Yakob L, Shepard DS, Brady OJ",BMC Med,2019 Sep 9,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
31081162,Forest cover and climate as potential drivers for dengue fever in Sumatra and Kalimantan 2006-2016: a spatiotemporal analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: To describe and quantify spatiotemporal trends of dengue fever at district level in Sumatra and Kalimantan, Indonesia in relation to forest cover and climatic factors. METHODS: A spatial ecological study design was used to analyse monthly surveillance data of notified dengue fever cases from January 2006 to December 2016 in the 154 districts of Sumatra and 56 districts of Kalimantan. A multivariate, zero-inflated Poisson regression model was developed with a conditional autoregressive prior structure with posterior parameters estimated using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation with Gibbs sampling. RESULTS: There were 230 745 cases in Sumatra and 132 186 cases in Kalimantan during the study period. In Sumatra, the risk of dengue fever decreased by 9% (95% credible interval [CrI] 8.5-9.5%) for a 1% increase in forest cover and by 12.2% (95% CrI 11.9-12.6%) for a 1% increase in relative humidity. In Kalimantan, dengue fever risk fell by 17.6% (95% CrI 17.1-18.1%) for a 1% increase in relative humidity and rose by 7.6% (95% CrI 6.9-8.4%) for a 1  degrees C increase in minimum temperature. There was no significant residual spatial clustering in Sumatra after accounting for climate and demographic variables. In Kalimantan, high residual risk areas were primarily centred in North and East of the island. CONCLUSIONS: Dengue fever in Sumatra and Kalimantan was highly seasonal and associated with climate factors and deforestation. Incorporation of climate indicators into risk-based surveillance might be warranted for dengue fever in Indonesia.","Husnina Z, Clements ACA, Wangdi K",Trop Med Int Health,2019 Jul,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
37798703,Facilitators and barriers to engaging communities in health service research on dengue control in Indo-Pacific region: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue is a public health problem in the Indo-Pacific countries. There are concerns over the facilitators and barriers to community engagement in health service research aimed at dengue control. The objective of his study was to identify and synthesize facilitators and barriers to community engagement in health service research aimed at dengue control. METHODOLOGY: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) checklist was used to perform this review. Health-related databases including PubMed, Ovid, and Google Scholar were searched for relevant studies. A consolidated framework with five domains was developed after undertaking a six-phase reflective thematic assessment of the data. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were identified, spanning eight low-and middle-income countries of the Indo-Pacific region including Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam. The studies in this review covered the period from 2002 to 2021. A broad range of study designs and objectives were revealed across these 13 studies. An array of communities such as the local government, project-related health staff, local health services staff, community leaders, local communities/residences/general public, heads of households, community health volunteers, school teachers, and schoolchildren participated in these dengue related studies. The five Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) domains of 'intervention characteristics', 'inner setting', 'outer setting',' individual characteristics', and 'program implementations' were used to identify and describe barriers and facilitators. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate a range of barriers and facilitators to community engagement in dengue control in the selected LMIC in the Indo-Pacific countries. Future health services research on dengue control approaches should be carefully planned, methodologically constructed, aligned with community engagement principles, and involve considerable community participation at all stages of the research.","Naing C, Htet NH, Tung WS, Aung HH, Whittaker MA",BMC Public Health,2023 Oct 5,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia

We assessed dengue and Zika virus seroprevalence in Aceh province, the westernmost area of the Indonesian archipelago. Serum samples collected from 199 randomly sampled healthy residents of Aceh Jaya in 2017 were analyzed for neutralizing antibodies by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Almost all study participants (198/199; 99.5%) presented with multitypic profiles of neutralizing antibodies to two or more DENV serotypes, indicating transmission of multiple DENV in the region prior to 2017. All residents were exposed to one or more DENV serotypes by the age of 30 years. The highest geometric mean titers were measured for DENV-4, followed by DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-3. Among a subset of 116 sera, 27 neutralized ZIKV with a high stringency (20 with PRNT(90) > 10 and 7 with PRNT(90) > 40). This study showed that DENV is hyperendemic in the westernmost region of the Indonesian archipelago and suggested that ZIKV may have circulated prior to 2017.","Harapan H, Panta K, Michie A, Ernst T, McCarthy S, Muhsin M, Safarianti S, Zanaria TM, Mudatsir M, Sasmono RT, Imrie A",Viruses,2022 Jan 24,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
40352191,Resistance status of Aedes mosquitoes as dengue vectors and the potential of plant larvicides from Indonesia for biological control: A narrative review.,"Dengue fever remains a major public health threat in Indonesia, exacerbated by rising insecticide resistance in Aedes aegypti. Strategies relying on chemical insecticides, while initially effective, have led to widespread resistance in mosquito populations. This resistance is particularly pronounced in areas such as Java, where the extensive use of insecticides, including organophosphates and pyrethroids, has been documented. To address this challenge, one promising alternative is the utilization of biolarvicides derived from local Indonesian plant materials. Biolarvicides are environmentally friendly, safe, and have the potential to mitigate the adverse impacts associated with chemical insecticides. Numerous studies have explored the larvicidal properties of indigenous plants native to Indonesia, demonstrating their efficacy against A. aegypti. The aim of this study was to examine insecticide resistance in Aedes mosquitoes across Indonesia, highlighting geographical variations and underexplored regions, and exploring plant- based biolarvicides as sustainable alternatives. Biolarvicides derived from native Indonesian plants could be eco-friendly alternative for dengue vector management. Their integration into existing control strategies could significantly enhance efforts to control dengue while reducing the environmental and health risks posed by chemical insecticides.","Kasman K, Ishak H, Alam G, Amiruddin R, Hastutiek P, Arsin AA, Nasir S, Ridha MR, Wahid I",Narra J,2025 Apr,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia

During early 2020, an outbreak of severe dengue occurred in Maumere, East Nusa Tenggara province, a region with low dengue endemicity with limited data on the characteristics of the circulating DENV. By 18 March 2020, 1396 cases were reported with 14 fatalities. Investigation was conducted to understand the cause and characteristics of the outbreak. METHODS: Sera were collected from 133 patients with dengue-like symptoms through random sampling at TC Hillers Hospital, Maumere during outbreak between February and June 2020. Dengue was confirmed using NS1 and/or RT-PCR detection. Serological status was determined using IgG/IgM ELISA and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). DENV serotyping and genome sequencing were performed to identify the DENV serotype and genotype. RESULTS: We recruited suspected dengue patients attending the hospital during the outbreak. Dengue was confirmed in 72.2% (96/133), while 18.8% (25/133) were diagnosed as probable dengue. Children under 18 years old accounted for 85.1% (103/121) of dengue cases. Severe dengue accounted for 94.2% (81/86) of cases. Secondary infections made up 92.6% (112/121) of cases. Serotyping detected 87.3% (62/71) as DENV-3, 7.0% (5/71) as DENV-4, 2.8% (2/71) as DENV-1, and 2.8% (2/71) as DENV-2. Phylogenetic analysis revealed close evolutionary relationship of Maumere DENV to viruses from other Indonesian regions, especially Bali and Kupang. PRNT on DENV-3 secondary infections patients detected the presence of DENV-2 and DENV-4 neutralizing antibodies. CONCLUSION: The severe dengue outbreak in Maumere is caused by DENV-3 introduced from nearby islands. The high proportion of secondary infections likely contributes to the severity of the disease. The high percentage of anti-dengue neutralizing antibodies for multiple serotypes and the high proportion of anti-dengue IgG in young children suggests a history of dengue transmission with a high infection rate in the area.","Santoso MS, Nara MBR, Nugroho DK, Yohan B, Purnama A, Boro AMB, Hayati RF, Gae EP, Denis D, Rana B, Hibberd ML, Sasmono RT",PLoS One,2025,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia

Therefore, this study aims to examine whether the Indonesian National Health Insurance (INHI) sample data could complement dengue case-based surveillance system in a more practical way. Afterwards, this analysis also identified several future opportunities and challenges in improving the dengue surveillance system. We utilized the referral care table linked with capitation and non-capitation-based primary care service table from 2015-2016. Data cleaning, query and visualization were performed using Tableau Public and Microsoft Power BI. Result shows that dengue referral pattern is indicating the opportunity to detect dengue cases in an earlier stage and high utilization of referral care disclose the patient behaviour. Therefore, anonymous INHI sample data set potentially to complement dengue traditional surveillance system. A huge number of health facilities as data providers, bridging and interoperability chance and opportunity of early detection are identified as future opportunities. However, we also determine challenges involving how to provide the mechanism for the quick and interoperable reporting system, how to construct supportive regulation and anticipatory approach regarding the change in dengue diagnosis criteria as the implementation of ICD 11 code.

35305089,"Temporal Correlation Between Urban Microclimate, Vector Mosquito Abundance, and Dengue Cases.","Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) is a major mosquito-borne viral disease. Studies have reported a strong correlation between weather, the abundance of Aedes aegypti, the vector of DHF virus, and dengue incidence. However, this conclusion has been based on the general climate pattern of wide regions. In general, however, the human population, level of infrastructure, and land-use change in rural and urban areas often produce localized climate patterns that may influence the interaction between climate, vector abundance, and dengue incidence. Thoroughly understanding this correlation will allow the development of a customized and precise local early warning system. To achieve this purpose, we conducted a cohort study, during January-December 2017, in 16 districts in Bandung, West Java, Indonesia. In the selected areas, local weather stations and modified light mosquito traps were set up to obtain data regarding daily weather and the abundance of adult female Ae. aegypti. A generalized linear model was applied to analyze the effect of local weather and female adult Ae. aegypti on the number of dengue cases. The result showed a significant non-linear correlation among mosquito abundance, maximum temperature, and dengue cases. Using our model, the data showed that the addition of a single adult Ae. aegypti mosquito increased the risk of dengue infection by 1.8%, while increasing the maximum temperature by one degree decreased the risk by 17%. This finding suggests specific actionable insights needed to supplement existing mosquito eradication programs.","Faridah L, Fauziah N, Agustian D, Mindra Jaya IGN, Eka Putra R, Ekawardhani S, Hidayath N, Damar Djati I, Carvajal TM, Mayasari W, Ruluwedrata Rinawan F, Watanabe K",J Med Entomol,2022 May 11,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia

30388105,Geographic variation in dengue seroprevalence and force of infection in the urban paediatric population of Indonesia.,"Understanding the heterogeneous nature of dengue transmission is important for prioritizing and guiding the implementation of prevention strategies. However, passive surveillance data in endemic countries are rarely adequately informative. We analyzed data from a cluster-sample, cross-sectional seroprevalence study in 1-18 year-olds to investigate geographic differences in dengue seroprevalence and force of infection in Indonesia. We used catalytic models to estimate the force of infection in each of the 30 randomly selected sub-districts. Based on these estimates, we determined the proportion of sub-districts expected to reach seroprevalence levels of 50%, 70% and 90% by year of age. We used population averaged generalized estimating equation models to investigate individual- and cluster-level determinants of dengue seropositivity. Dengue force of infection varied substantially across Indonesia, ranging from 4.3% to 30.0% between sub-districts. By age nine, 60% of sub-districts are expected to have a seroprevalence >/=70%, rising to 83% by age 11. Higher odds of seropositivity were associated with higher population density (OR = 1.54 per 10-fold rise in population density, 95% CI: 1.03-2.32) and with City (relative to Regency) administrative status (OR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.32-2.79). Our findings highlight the substantial variation in dengue endemicity within Indonesia and the importance of understanding spatial heterogeneity in dengue transmission intensity for optimal dengue prevention strategies including future implementation of dengue vaccination programmes.","Tam CC, O'Driscoll M, Taurel AF, Nealon J, Hadinegoro SR",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,2018 Nov,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
25064368,The changing incidence of dengue haemorrhagic fever in Indonesia: a 45-year registry-based analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Increases in human population size, dengue vector-density and human mobility cause rapid spread of dengue virus in Indonesia. We investigated the changes in dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) incidence in Indonesia over a 45-year period and determined age-specific trends in annual DHF incidence. METHODS: Using an on-going nationwide dengue surveillance program starting in 1968, we evaluated all DHF cases and related deaths longitudinally up to 2013. Population demographics were used to calculate annual incidence and case fatality ratios (CFRs). Age-specific data on DHF available from 1993 onwards were used to assess trends in DHF age-distribution. Time-dependency of DHF incidence and CFRs was assessed using the Cochrane-Armitage trend test. RESULTS: The annual DHF incidence increased from 0.05/100,000 in 1968 to ~ 35-40/100,000 in 2013, with superimposed epidemics demonstrating a similar increasing trend with the highest epidemic occurring in 2010 (85.70/100,000; p < 0.01). The CFR declined from 41% in 1968 to 0.73% in 2013 (p < 0.01). Mean age of DHF cases increased during the observation period. Highest incidence of DHF was observed among children aged 5 to 14 years up to 1998, but declined thereafter (p < 0.01). In those aged 15 years or over, DHF incidence increased (p < 0.01) and surpassed that of 5 to 14 year olds from 1999 onwards. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of DHF over the past 45 years in Indonesia increased rapidly with peak incidence shifting from young children to older age groups. The shifting age pattern should have consequences for targeted surveillance and prevention.","Karyanti MR, Uiterwaal CS, Kusriastuti R, Hadinegoro SR, Rovers MM, Heesterbeek H, Hoes AW, Bruijning-Verhagen P",BMC Infect Dis,2014 Jul 26,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
1509881,Dengue encephalopathy.,"Dengue encephalopathy or dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) with CNS involvement used to be considered a relatively rare condition; but the number of cases reported in human studies has been increasing every year. Diagnosis of dengue encephalopathy is based on clinically diagnosed DHF according to the W.H.O. criteria (1980), with CNS manifestations consisting of abrupt onset of hyperpyrexia, non-transient alteration of consciousness, headache, vomiting--with or without seizures--and normal CSF. Many factors may be considered to be directly or indirectly associated with CNS signs and symptoms in DHF, the main pathology being leakage of plasma into serous spaces and abnormal hemostasis, leading to hypovolemic shock and hemorrhage in many organs of the body. Acute liver failure is considered to be one of the main factors causing brain pathology. One hundred fifty-two cases of dengue encephalopathy admitted during 3 periods at the Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in Jakarta were studied retrospectively. The overall incidence was 152 out of 2,441 DHF cases, or 6.2%. The most pronounced symptoms were hyperpyrexia, alteration of consciousness and convulsions. Laboratory examination showed an unusually high increase of serum transaminases, hyponatremia, and hypoxia. Neurologic abnormalities detected were hemiparesis and tetraparesis of the extremities, and second nerve atrophy; such abnormalities were found in 10 out of the 152 cases, or 6.5%.","Hendarto SK, Hadinegoro SR",Acta Paediatr Jpn,1992 Jun,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia

The four dengue viruses were isolated from Thai infants, all of whom were having a primary dengue infection. Progress studying the immunologically distinct infant DHF/DSS has been limited; most contemporary research has centered on DHF/DSS accompanying secondary dengue infections. In designing research results obtained in studies on a congruent animal model, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) infections of kittens born to FIPV-immune queens should be considered.

31036062,"Paediatric dengue infection in Cirebon, Indonesia: a temporal and spatial analysis of notified dengue incidence to inform surveillance.","BACKGROUND: The recent situation of dengue infection in Cirebon district is concerning due to an upsurge trend since the year 2010. The largest dengue outbreak was reported in 2016 which has affected more than 1600 children. A study was conducted to explore the temporal variability of dengue outbreak in Cirebon's child population in during 2011-2017, and to assess the short-term effects of climatic and environmental factor on dengue incidence. In addition, the spatial pattern of dengue incidence in children and high-risk villages were investigated. METHODS: A total of 4597 confirmed dengue cases in children notified from January 2011 to December 2017 were analysed. Seasonal decomposition analysis was carried out to examine the annual seasonality. A generalized linear model (GLM) was applied to assess the short-term effect of climate and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) on dengue incidence. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) of the final model was reported. Spatial analyses were conducted by using Moran's I and local indicator of spatial association (LISA) analyses to explore geographical clustering in incidence and to identify high-risk villages for dengue, respectively. RESULTS: An annual dengue epidemic period was observed with peaks occurring every January/February. Based on the GLM, temperature at a lag 4 months (IRR = 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 95% CI: 1.22-1.31, P < 0.001), rainfall at a lag 2 months (IRR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.99-0.99, P < 0.001), humidity at lag 0 month (IRR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.04-1.06, P < 0.001) and NDVI at a lag 1 month (IRR = 3.07, 95% CI: 1.94-4.86, P < 0.001) were associated with dengue incidence in children. The dengue incidence in children was spatially varied and clustered at the village level across Cirebon. During 2011-2017, a total of 38 high-risk villages for dengue were identified, which were mainly located in the northern part of Cirebon. CONCLUSIONS: Seasonal patterns of dengue incidence in children in Cirebon were strongly associated with rainfall, temperature, humidity and NDVI variability, suggesting that climatic and environmental data could be used to help predict dengue outbreaks. Our spatial analysis revealed a clustered pattern in dengue incidence and high-risk villages for dengue across Cirebon, suggesting that effective interventions such as vector surveillance and school-based campaigns should be prioritized around the identified high-risk villages. Temporal and spatial analytical tools could be utilized to support local health authorities to apply timely and targeted public health interventions and help better planning and decision-making in order to minimize the impact of dengue outbreaks.","Astuti EP, Dhewantara PW, Prasetyowati H, Ipa M, Herawati C, Hendrayana K",Parasit Vectors,2019 Apr 29,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
12812338,Transmission of epidemic dengue hemorrhagic fever in easternmost Indonesia.,"In April 2001, a second suspected outbreak of dengue hemorrhagic fever in the easternmost region of Indonesia was investigated in Merauke, a town located in the southeastern corner of Papua, by the Indonesian Ministry of Health and the U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit No. 2. Principal case criteria of hemorrhagic disease provided for a study enrollment of 15 clinically acute and 37 convalescing subjects. Additionally, 32 comparable age/sex controls were selected from neighboring households. Laboratory diagnosis involved three testing methodologies: virus isolation by cell culture, a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, and serologic assays. Antibody (IgM) to dengue virus was detected in 27% of the acute clinical cases, 30% of the convalescing cases, and only 3% of the matched controls. Dengue 3 was the only viral serotype detected from acute serum samples by the RT-PCR. The mean +/- SD age of the acute and convalescing cases was 7.8 +/- 5.4 years. Overall hospital records accounted for 172 suspected outbreak cases, all urban residents of Merauke with no recent travel history outside the area. The estimated outbreak-associated case fatality rate among all suspected dengue cases was 1.2%. A seven-year retrospective review of hospital records in Merauke showed negligible disease reporting involving hemorrhagic disease prior to the outbreak.","Sukri NC, Laras K, Wandra T, Didi S, Larasati RP, Rachdyatmaka JR, Osok S, Tjia P, Saragih JM, Hartati S, Listyaningsih E, Porter KR, Beckett CG, Prawira IS, Punjabi N, Suparmanto SA, Beecham HJ, Bangs MJ, Corwin AL",Am J Trop Med Hyg,2003 May,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
33587144,Is there any association between body mass index and severity of dengue infection?,"BACKGROUND: Dengue, an acute infectious disease caused by a flavivirus, is a threat to global health. There is sparse evidence exploring obesity and the development of more severe dengue cases in adults. With increasing prevalence of obesity in areas with a high risk of dengue infection, obesity may increase the burden and mortality related to dengue infection. Our study aimed to determine the association between obesity and the development of more severe dengue infection in primary healthcare settings and whether these associations were modified by dengue fever phase. METHODS: A cohort study was conducted among laboratory-confirmed dengue patients aged >18 y in the central region of Peninsular Malaysia from May 2016 to November 2017. We collected demographic, clinical history, physical examination and laboratory examination information using a standardized form. Dengue severity (DS) was defined as either dengue with warning signs or severe dengue. Participants underwent daily follow-up, during which we recorded their vital signs, warning signs and full blood count results. Incidence of DS was modeled using mixed-effects logistic regression. Changes in platelet count and hematocrit were modeled using mixed-effects linear regression. The final multivariable models were adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity and previous dengue infection. RESULTS: A total of 173 patients were enrolled and followed up. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 37.4+/-13.75 kg/m2. The majority of patients were Malay (65.9%), followed by Chinese (17.3%), Indian (12.7%) and other ethnic groups (4.1%). A total of 90 patients (52.0%) were male while 36 patients (20.8%) had a previous history of dengue infection. BMI was significantly associated with DS (adjusted OR=1.17; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.34) and hematocrit (%) (abeta=0.09; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.16), but not with platelet count (x103/microL) (abeta=-0.01; 95% CI -0.84 to 0.81). In the dose response analysis, we found that as BMI increases, the odds of DS, hematocrit levels and platelet levels increase during the first phase of dengue fever. CONCLUSION: Higher BMI and higher hematocrit levels were associated with higher odds of DS. Among those with high BMI, the development of DS was observed during phase one of dengue fever instead of during phase two. These novel results could be used by clinicians to help them risk-stratify dengue patients for closer monitoring and subsequent prevention of severe dengue complications.","Zulkipli MS, Rampal S, Bulgiba A, Peramalah D, Jamil N, See LLC, Zaki RA, Omar SFS, Dahlui M",Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,2021 Jul 1,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
32793541,Stegomyia Indices and Risk of Dengue Transmission: A Lack of Correlation.,"Dengue is present in 128 countries worldwide and is still expanding. There is currently no treatment or universally approved vaccine available. Therefore, prevention and control of mosquito vectors remain the most efficient ways of managing the risk of dengue outbreaks. The Stegomyia indices have been developed as quantitative indicators of the risk of dengue outbreaks. However, conflictual data are circulating about their reliability. We report in this article the first extensive study on Stegomyia indices, covering 78 locations of differing environmental and socio-economic conditions, climate, and population density across Indonesia, from West Sumatra to Papua. A total of 65,876 mosquito larvae and pupae were collected for the study. A correlation was found between incidence and human population density. No correlation was found between the incidence of dengue and the Stegomyia indices.","Garjito TA, Hidajat MC, Kinansi RR, Setyaningsih R, Anggraeni YM, Mujiyanto, Trapsilowati W, Jastal, Ristiyanto, Satoto TBT, Gavotte L, Manguin S, Frutos R",Front Public Health,2020,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
24047732,Correlation between complement component levels and disease severity in dengue patients in Indonesia.,"Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is a severe form of dengue fever (DF). Recent in vitro studies indicate that complement reduces the infection-enhancing activity of dengue antibodies, suggesting its in vivo role in controlling viremia levels and disease severity. In this study, the complement hemolytic activity (CH50) and levels of complement components and related factors in dengue patients in Indonesia were assessed. Based on the number of days since fever onset, DF patients were compared with patients at the DHF pre-critical phase who showed deterioration within 2 days. The mean CH50 values and levels of C2, C4, and factors B and H in the DHF pre-critical phase group were significantly lower than those in the DF group. The mean CH50 values were significantly correlated with C4, factor B, or factor H levels, indicating their responsibility for reduced CH50 values. Furthermore, a significantly higher proportion of the DHF pre-critical phase group (78%) than the DF group (33%) was positive for the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) antigen. These results suggested that antibody-dependent enhancement of infection occurs during a period of low complement activity, which is associated with NS1 levels during the acute phase in some patients, thereby leading to increased viremia levels and greater disease severity.","Yamanaka A, Hendrianto E, Mulyatno KC, Susilowati H, Ginting AP, Sary DD, Soegijanto S, Konishi E",Jpn J Infect Dis,2013,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
28450651,The Immunogenicity and Safety of CYD-Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine (CYD-TDV) in Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Review.,"AIM: to assess the immunogenicity and safety of CYD-tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV) in children. METHODS: comprehensive literature searches were conducted on various databases. Randomized-controlled trials on children with CYD-TDV as intervention were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data extracted from selected trials included safety of vaccine and immunogenicity in terms of Geometric Mean Titres (GMT) of antibodies. RESULTS:   six clinical trials were selected based on preset criteria. GMT values were obtained using 50% Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) and safety was semi-quantitatively assessed based on adverse effects. Additional data processing was done to obtain a better understanding on the trends among the studies. The results showed that the groups vaccinated with CYD-TDV showed higher immunogenicity against dengue virus antigens than the control groups. Safety results were satisfactory in all trials, and most severe side effects were unrelated to the vaccine. CONCLUSION: CYD-TDV is both effective and safe for patients in endemic regions. This gives promise for further development and large-scale research on this vaccine to assess its efficacy in decreasing dengue prevalence, and its pervasive implementation in endemic countries, such as Indonesia.","Agarwal R, Wahid MH, Yausep OE, Angel SH, Lokeswara AW",Acta Med Indones,2017 Jan,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
37450543,Dengue seroprevalence study in Bali.,"INTRODUCTION: Dengue infection poses significant public health problems in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. The clinical manifestations of dengue vary from asymptomatic to severe dengue manifestations. This serological survey highlighted the high incidence of asymptomatic cases. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of dengue in healthy and ill adults in Bali. METHODS: Cross-sectional seroprevalence surveys were performed between July 2020 and June 2021 among healthy and ill adults in Denpasar Bali. Blood samples were collected from 539 randomly selected urban sites in Denpasar. Immunoglobulin G antibodies against the dengue virus were detected in serum using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. RESULTS: Overall, the dengue seroprevalence rate among the 539 clinically healthy and ill adults was high (85.5%). The median age was 34.1 (18-86.1). Most of the participants in the study were younger than 40 years (61.2%). Men were the dominant sex (54.5%). The study found a significant association between dengue seropositivity among people aged > 40 years and healthy status (p = 0.005; odds ratio [OR] = 0.459 and p < 0.001; OR = 0.336, respectively). The study reported that as many as 60% of the subjects had a history of previously suspected dengue infection. This study reflected the proportion of asymptomatic dengue patients requiring better assessment with a serological test. CONCLUSION: The current study highlighted that real cases of dengue infection may be higher than reported, with a high prevalence of dengue seropositivity and a relatively dominant proportion of asymptomatic cases. The study guides physicians to be aware of every dengue infection in tropical countries and prevent the spread of the disease.","Masyeni S, Fatawy RM, Paramasatiari AAAL, Maheraditya A, Dewi RK, Winianti NW, Santosa A, Setiabudy M, Sumadewi NT, Herawati S",PLoS One,2023,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
32706682,"Causality Analysis of Google Trends and Dengue Incidence in Bandung, Indonesia With Linkage of Digital Data Modeling: Longitudinal Observational Study.","BACKGROUND: The popularity of dengue can be inferred from Google Trends that summarizes Google searches of related topics. Both the disease and its Google Trends have a similar source of causation in the dengue virus, leading us to hypothesize that dengue incidence and Google Trends results have a long-run equilibrium. OBJECTIVE: This research aimed to investigate the properties of this long-run equilibrium in the hope of using the information derived from Google Trends for the early detection of upcoming dengue outbreaks. METHODS: This research used the cointegration method to assess a long-run equilibrium between dengue incidence and Google Trends results. The long-run equilibrium was characterized by their linear combination that generated a stationary process. The Dickey-Fuller test was adopted to check the stationarity of the processes. An error correction model (ECM) was then adopted to measure deviations from the long-run equilibrium to examine the short-term and long-term effects. The resulting models were used to determine the Granger causality between the two processes. Additional information about the two processes was obtained by examining the impulse response function and variance decomposition. RESULTS: The Dickey-Fuller test supported an implicit null hypothesis that the dengue incidence and Google Trends results are nonstationary processes (P=.01). A further test showed that the processes were cointegrated (P=.01), indicating that their particular linear combination is a stationary process. These results permitted us to construct ECMs. The model showed the direction of causality of the two processes, indicating that Google Trends results will Granger-cause dengue incidence (not in the reverse order). CONCLUSIONS: Various hypothesis testing results in this research concluded that Google Trends results can be used as an initial indicator of upcoming dengue outbreaks.","Syamsuddin M, Fakhruddin M, Sahetapy-Engel JTM, Soewono E",J Med Internet Res,2020 Jul 24,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
34409443,"Autochthonous dengue outbreak in Italy 2020: clinical, virological and entomological findings.","BACKGROUND: In August 2020, in the context of COVID-19 pandemics, an autochthonous dengue outbreak was identified for the first time in Italy. METHODS: Following the reporting of the index case of autochthonous dengue, epidemiological investigation, vector control and substances of human origin safety measures were immediately activated, according to the national arbovirus surveillance plan. Dengue cases were followed-up with weekly visits and laboratory tests until recovery and clearance of viral RNA from blood. RESULTS: The primary dengue case was identified in a young woman, who developed fever after returning from Indonesia to northern Italy, on 27 July 2020. She spent the mandatory quarantine for COVID-19 at home with relatives, six of whom developed dengue within two weeks. Epidemiological investigation identified further five autochthonous dengue cases among people who lived or stayed near the residence of the primary case. The last case of the outbreak developed fever on 29 September 2020. Dengue cases had a mild febrile illness, except one with persistent asthenia and myalgia. DENV-1 RNA was detected in blood and/or urine in all autochthonous cases, up to 35 days after fever onset. All cases developed IgM and IgG antibodies which cross-reacted with West Nile virus (WNV) and other flaviviruses. Sequencing of the full viral genome from blood samples showed over 99% nucleotide identity with DENV-1 strains isolated in China in 2014-2015; phylogenetic analysis classified the virus within Genotype I. Entomological site inspection identified a high density of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which conceivably sustained local DENV-1 transmission. Aedes koreicus mosquitoes were also collected in the site. CONCLUSIONS: Areas in Europe with high density of Aedes mosquitoes should be considered at risk for dengue transmission. The presence of endemic flaviviruses, such as WNV, might pose problems in the laboratory diagnosis.","Barzon L, Gobbi F, Capelli G, Montarsi F, Martini S, Riccetti S, Sinigaglia A, Pacenti M, Pavan G, Rassu M, Padovan MT, Manfrin V, Zanella F, Russo F, Foglia F, Lazzarini L",J Travel Med,2021 Dec 29,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
34307199,Homogeneity and Possible Replacement of Populations of the Dengue Vectors Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus in Indonesia.,"Currently, Aedes aegypti, the principal vector of dengue virus in Indonesia, has spread throughout the archipelago. Aedes albopictus is also present. Invasion and high adaptability of the Aedes mosquitoes to all of these areas are closely related to their ecology and biology. Between June 2016 and July 2017, larval and adult mosquito collections were conducted in 43 locations in 25 provinces of Indonesia using standardized sampling methods for dengue vector surveillance. The samples collected were analyzed for polymorphism and phylogenetic relationship using the mitochondrial cox1 gene and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2). Almost all Ae. aegypti samples collected in this study (89%) belonged to the same haplotype. A similar situation is observed with the nuclear ITS2 marker. Populations of Ae. aegypti characterized few years ago were genetically different. A closely related observation was made with Aedes albopictus for which the current populations are different from those described earlier. Ae. aegypti populations were found to be highly homogenous all over Indonesia with all samples belonging to the same maternal lineage. Although difficult to demonstrate formally, there is a possibility of population replacement. Although to a lower extent, a similar conclusion was reached with Ae. albopictus.","Garjito TA, Widiarti W, Hidajat MC, Handayani SW, Mujiyono M, Prihatin MT, Ubaidillah R, Sudomo M, Satoto TBT, Manguin S, Gavotte L, Frutos R",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,2021,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
38902692,Exploring community needs in combating aedes mosquitoes and dengue fever: a study with urban community in the recurrent hotspot area.,"BACKGROUND: Aedes mosquitoes are the main vector of dengue infection, a global health threat affecting millions of people annually. Conventional prevention and control methods against dengue outbreaks have only achieved marginal success. Recognizing the complex issue at hand, a multilevel participatory approach is crucial. Thus, alternative strategies that involve community engagement are increasingly being considered and attempted. While community-based vector control programs have been conducted, sustaining behavioral changes among the population remains a challenge. This study aimed to identify the specific community needs in combating Aedes mosquitoes and dengue fever as a basis to guide the development of community-driven initiatives and foster a deeper sense of ownership in the fight against dengue. METHODS: Between 1 August 2022 and 30 November 2022, we conducted a study in Hulu Langat district, Selangor, using a mixed-method design. All participants consented to the study, which comprised 27 participants (FGDs) and 15 participants (IDIs). The IDIs included two participants with a history of dengue fever, one community leader, one faith leader, seven local authorities, and four district health officers. Semi-structured interviews and discussions were performed among stakeholders and community members recruited via purposive and snowball sampling techniques. All interviews were audio-recorded before being analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: These results derived from qualitative data explored the perspectives and needs of communities in combating Aedes mosquitoes and dengue fever. Interviews were conducted with various stakeholders, including community members, leaders, and health officers. The study identified the necessity of decisive actions by authorities to address the impact of the dengue epidemic, the importance of community engagement through partnerships and participatory approaches, the potential benefits of incentives and rewards to enhance community participation, and the need for sustained community engagement and education, especially via the involvement of young people in prevention efforts. These findings provide valuable insights into the design of effective strategies against Aedes mosquitoes and dengue fever. CONCLUSIONS: In short, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive approach involving multiple stakeholders in the fight against Aedes mosquitoes and dengue fever. The approach should incorporate efforts to raise awareness, provide practical resources, and foster community responsibility. The active involvement of teenagers as volunteers can contribute to long-term prevention efforts. Collaboration, resource allocation, and community engagement are crucial for effective dengue control and a healthier environment.","Samsudin NA, Othman H, Siau CS, Zaini ZI",BMC Public Health,2024 Jun 20,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
37325468,"Predicting potential areas at risk of the Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever in Jakarta, Indonesia-analyzing the accuracy of predictive hot spot analysis in the absence of small geographical area data.","Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF), a more severe form of dengue, is one of the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne diseases in the world. This study is motivated by the rising DHF incidence in Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia. We mainly utilized hot spot analysis, which employs spatial statistics to find at-risk areas for DHF outbreaks in Jakarta's five municipalities. However, producing informative results from hot spot analysis requires a complete set of data on each of Jakarta's 42 districts, which is not available. We thus propose the idea of using small area estimation (SAE) and machine learning to make up for the lack of data. To evaluate whether this proposed method is effective, we compare the hot spot results from the estimation with the actual data of each district. The results show that the estimated hot spot map is similar to the hot spot map from the actual data. This implies that it is possible to find potential at-risk areas of dengue fever without a complete dataset in every small geographic area. We expect that this research can increase the performance of DHF control measures at the district level, even in the absence of small area data.","Prasetya V, Vito V, Tanawi IN, Aldila D, Hertono GF",Infect Ecol Epidemiol,2023,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia
27007959,Symptomatic Dengue in Children in 10 Asian and Latin American Countries.,"BACKGROUND: The control groups in two phase 3 trials of dengue vaccine efficacy included two large regional cohorts that were followed up for dengue infection. These cohorts provided a sample for epidemiologic analyses of symptomatic dengue in children across 10 countries in Southeast Asia and Latin America in which dengue is endemic. METHODS: We monitored acute febrile illness and virologically confirmed dengue (VCD) in 3424 healthy children, 2 to 16 years of age, in Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam) from June 2011 through December 2013 and in 6939 children, 9 to 18 years of age, in Latin America (Brazil, Colombia, Honduras, Mexico, and Puerto Rico) from June 2011 through April 2014. Acute febrile episodes were determined to be VCD by means of a nonstructural protein 1 antigen immunoassay and reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assays. Dengue hemorrhagic fever was defined according to 1997 World Health Organization criteria. RESULTS: Approximately 10% of the febrile episodes in each cohort were confirmed to be VCD, with 319 VCD episodes (4.6 episodes per 100 person-years) occurring in the Asian cohort and 389 VCD episodes (2.9 episodes per 100 person-years) occurring in the Latin American cohort; no trend according to age group was observed. The incidence of dengue hemorrhagic fever was less than 0.3 episodes per 100 person-years in each cohort. The percentage of VCD episodes requiring hospitalization was 19.1% in the Asian cohort and 11.1% in the Latin American cohort. In comparable age groups (9 to 12 years and 13 to 16 years), the burden of dengue was higher in Asia than in Latin America. CONCLUSIONS: The burdens of dengue were substantial in the two regions and in all age groups. Burdens varied widely according to country, but the rates were generally higher and the disease more frequently severe in Asian countries than in Latin American countries.

24069482,"Public acceptance and willingness-to-pay for a future dengue vaccine: a community-based survey in Bandung, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: All four serotypes of dengue virus are endemic in Indonesia, where the population at risk for infection exceeds 200 million people. Despite continuous control efforts that were initiated more than four decades ago, Indonesia still suffers from multi-annual cycles of dengue outbreak and dengue remains as a major public health problem. Dengue vaccines have been viewed as a promising solution for controlling dengue in Indonesia, but thus far its potential acceptability has not been assessed. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a household survey in the city of Bandung, Indonesia by administering a questionnaire to examine (i) acceptance of a hypothetical pediatric dengue vaccine; (ii) participant's willingness-to-pay (WTP) for the vaccine, had it not been provided for free; and (iii) whether people think vector control would be unnecessary if the vaccine was available. A proportional odds model and an interval regression model were employed to identify determinants of acceptance and WTP, respectively. We demonstrated that out of 500 heads of household being interviewed, 94.2% would agree to vaccinate their children with the vaccine. Of all participants, 94.6% were willing to pay for the vaccine with a median WTP of US$1.94. In addition, 7.2% stated that vector control would not be necessary had there been a dengue vaccination program. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that future dengue vaccines can have a very high uptake even when delivered through the private market. This, however, can be influenced by vaccine characteristics and price. In addition, reduction in community vector control efforts may be observed following vaccine introduction but its potential impact in the transmission of dengue and other vector-borne diseases requires further study.","Hadisoemarto PF, Castro MC",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,2013,Dengue Fever AND Indonesia

METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation in children with pulmonary TB and vitamin D insufficiency. Patients were randomly allocated with 1:1 ratio to receive either 1000 IU vitamin D or placebo daily after starting standard TB treatment. The primary outcome in this study was the resolution of fever and cough symptoms reviewed weekly after starting the treatment until the symptoms are resolved. The secondary outcome in this study was 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum level and nutritional status which was reviewed at the end of the trial. Intention to treat analyses were applied. Differences in clinical outcomes between two groups were calculated using Mann-Whitney U test or chi(2) test, where appropriate. FINDINGS: A total of 84 patients met the inclusion criteria, aged 6 to 18 years old, newly diagnosed with pulmonary TB and vitamin D insufficiency. Eighty patients (95,2%) completed the six months follow-up. Faster resolution of fever, cough, improved malnutrition status, and higher vitamin D level were found in the intervention group compared to the placebo group (all P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D is beneficial in improving fever and cough resolution, and improving nutritional status in children with pulmonary TB and vitamin D insufficiency. Determination of adequate supplementation levels of more than 1000 IU requires further research to achieve normal vitamin D levels during the duration of treatment for pulmonary TB in children.

33377745,"Non-nutritional anemia: Malaria, thalassemia, G6PD deficiency and tuberculosis in Indonesia.","Anemia affects people worldwide and results in increased morbidity and mortality, particularly in children and reproductive-age women. Anemia is caused by an imbalance between red blood cell (RBC) loss and production (erythropoiesis), which can be caused by not only nutritional factors but also non-nutritional factors, such as inflammation and genetics. Understanding the complex and varied etiology of anemia is crucial for developing effective interventions and monitoring anemia control programs. This review focusses on two interrelated nonnutritional causes of anemia: malaria infection and RBC disorders (thalassemia and G6PD deficiency), as well as tuberculosis. According to the Haldane hypothesis, thalassemia occurs as a protective trait toward malaria infection, whereas G6PDd arises in malaria-endemic regions because of positive selection. Indonesia is a malariaendemic region; thus, the frequency of thalassemia and G6PD deficiency is high, which contributes to a greater risk for non-nutritional anemia. As Indonesia is the second global contributor to the newly diagnosed tuberculosis, and active pulmonary tuberculosis patients are more anemic, tuberculosis is also contributes to the increasing risk of anemia. Therefore, to reduce anemia rates in Indonesia, authorities must consider non-nutritional causes that might influence the local incidence of anemia, and apply co-management of endemic infectious disease such as malaria and tuberculosis, and of genetic disease i.e. thalassemia and G6PDd.","Malik SG, Oktavianthi S, Wahlqvist ML, Asih PBS, Harahap A, Satyagraha AW, Syafruddin D",Asia Pac J Clin Nutr,2020,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
36435182,Clinical and economic burden of drug-susceptible tuberculosis in Indonesia: national trends 2017-19.,"BACKGROUND: The global incidence of tuberculosis is decreasing, yet it remains high in Indonesia. The Indonesian National Tuberculosis Program facilitates mandatory notification, which enables early detection and treatment, minimises complications, prevents transmission, and decreases deaths. This study aimed to assess the characteristics, trends, and economic burden of notified drug-susceptible tuberculosis cases registered in this system from 2017 to 2019. METHODS: We performed a multiyear cross-sectional study focusing on drug-susceptible tuberculosis notified cases, incidence, geographical tuberculosis case distribution, treatment outcomes, and costs in Indonesia using data from Sistem Informasi Tuberkulosis (2017-19). The settings were Indonesian health-care facilities that provide tuberculosis control programmes and services. Eligible patients were those who were diagnosed with drug-susceptible tuberculosis and notified to Sistem Informasi Tuberkulosis. FINDINGS: Between 2017 and 2019, notified cases increased from 429 219 to 523 614 individuals, corresponding to an increase in incidence from 167 cases per 100 000 to 196 cases per 100 000. In 2019, more than 250 cases per 100 000 inhabitants were notified in Jakarta, North Sulawesi, Gorontalo, and Papua. Treatment success rate increased from 363 098 (84.60%) of 429 219 in 2017 to 452 966 (86.51%) of 523 614 in 2019, with a relatively stable mortality, changing from 3.15% to 3.05%. HIV status was increasingly confirmed, with unknown status decreasing from 66.21% to 43.68%. The costs of visits and monitoring and drug regimens were relatively stable, with total direct medical costs slightly increasing from US$39.40 to $40.40 per case. INTERPRETATION: Progress was made on drug-susceptible tuberculosis management in Indonesia. However, further intensified efforts, including case-finding, optimising diagnosis, and cost-effective tuberculosis management are required if Indonesia is to achieve the 2025 WHO End Tuberculosis Strategy target incidence of fewer than 55 cases per 100 000 people. These data are an important starting point for understanding drug-susceptible tuberculosis dynamics in Indonesia and optimising its management.

35777870,Xpert Ultra stool testing to diagnose tuberculosis in children in Ethiopia and Indonesia: a model-based cost-effectiveness analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: The WHO currently recommends stool testing using GeneXpert MTB/Rif (Xpert) for the diagnosis of paediatric tuberculosis (TB). The simple one-step (SOS) stool method enables processing for Xpert testing at the primary healthcare (PHC) level. We modelled the impact and cost-effectiveness of implementing the SOS stool method at PHC for the diagnosis of paediatric TB in Ethiopia and Indonesia, compared with the standard of care. SETTING: All children (age <15 years) presenting with presumptive TB at primary healthcare or hospital level in Ethiopia and Indonesia. PRIMARY OUTCOME: Cost-effectiveness estimated as incremental costs compared with incremental disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) saved. METHODS: Decision tree modelling was used to represent pathways of patient care and referral. We based model parameters on ongoing studies and surveillance, systematic literature review, and expert opinion. We estimated costs using data available publicly and obtained through in-country expert consultations. Health outcomes were based on modelled mortality and discounted life-years lost. RESULTS: The intervention increased the sensitivity of TB diagnosis by 19-25% in both countries leading to a 14-20% relative reduction in mortality. Under the intervention, fewer children seeking care at PHC were referred (or self-referred) to higher levels of care; the number of children initiating anti-TB treatment (ATT) increased by 18-25%; and more children (85%) initiated ATT at PHC level. Costs increased under the intervention compared with a base case using smear microscopy in the standard of care resulting in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of US$132 and US$94 per DALY averted in Ethiopia and Indonesia, respectively. At a cost-effectiveness threshold of 0.5xgross domestic product per capita, the projected probability of the intervention being cost-effective in Ethiopia and Indonesia was 87% and 96%, respectively. The intervention remained cost-effective under sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of the SOS stool method to national algorithms for diagnosing TB in children is likely to be cost-effective in both Ethiopia and Indonesia.","Mafirakureva N, Klinkenberg E, Spruijt I, Levy J, Shaweno D, de Haas P, Kaswandani N, Bedru A, Triasih R, Gebremichael M, Dodd PJ, Tiemersma EW",BMJ Open,2022 Jul 1,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
40057344,Tuberculosis.,"Tuberculosis is a leading cause of death globally. Given the airborne transmission of tuberculosis, anybody can be infected, but people in high-incidence settings are more exposed. Risk of progression to disease is higher in the first years after infection, and in people with undernourishment, immunosuppression, or who smoke, drink alcohol, or have diabetes. Although cough, fever, and weight loss are hallmark symptoms, people with tuberculosis can be asymptomatic, so a high index of suspicion is required. Prompt diagnosis can be made by sputum examination (ideally with rapid molecular tests), but chest radiography can be helpful. Most people with disease can be treated with regimens of 6 months or less; longer regimens may be necessary for those with drug resistance. Central to successful treatment is comprehensive, person-centred care including addressing key determinants, such as undernourishment, smoking, and alcohol use, and optimising management of comorbidities, such as diabetes and HIV. Care should continue after treatment ends, as long-term sequelae are common. Prevention relies mostly on treatment with rifamycin-based regimens; current vaccines have limited efficacy. Ongoing research on shorter and safer regimens for infection and disease treatment, and simpler and more accurate diagnostic methods will be key for tuberculosis elimination.","Trajman A, Campbell JR, Kunor T, Ruslami R, Amanullah F, Behr MA, Menzies D",Lancet,2025 Mar 8,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
29099497,Tuberculosis and other causes of uveitis in Indonesia.,"PurposeThe purpose of this study is to assess the causes of uveitis in Indonesia and determine the importance of tuberculosis (TB) as a cause of uveitis.Patients and methodsProspective cohort study examining 146 consecutive new human immunodeficiency virus-negative patients with active uveitis between June 2014 and May 2015. We assessed the anatomic locations and specific causes of uveitis, as well as associations with infectious and non-infectious systemic diseases. We determined the prevalence of positive QuantiFERON Tb Gold test (QFT) results in Indonesian patients with uveitis and calculated the number of patients with active systemic TB.ResultsPosterior and panuveitis were the most common anatomic entities (38% each). Infections represented the most frequent cause of uveitis (33%); the most prevalent were toxoplasmosis (19%) and active systemic TB (8%). The majority of patients were QFT positive (61%). A specific diagnosis could not be established in 45% of the patients. At first presentation to the ophthalmologist, the majority of patients (66%) had a visual acuity of less than finger counting at 3 m and already exhibited various complications of uveitis. When classifying the QFT-positive patients with unexplained uveitis into a TB-related group, the percentage of 'TB-associated' uveitis cases increased from 8-48%. Highly elevated QFT levels were observed in patients with uveitis of unknown cause and no signs of active systemic TB.ConclusionsIn Indonesia, infectious uveitis was the most common type of uveitis and the leading causes consisted of toxoplasmosis and TB. The association observed between highly elevated QFT results and uveitis of otherwise unexplained origins indicates that a link exists between the latent TB infection and the development of uveitis.","La Distia Nora R, Sitompul R, Bakker M, Susiyanti M, Edwar L, Sjamsoe S, Singh G, van Hagen MP, Rothova A",Eye (Lond),2018 Mar,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
37200338,"The prevalence and risk factors for tuberculosis among healthcare workers in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.","Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at risk of contracting TB, particularly when in high tuberculosis (TB) burden settings. Routine surveillance data and evidence are limited on the burden of TB amongst HCWs in Indonesia. We aimed to measure the prevalence of TB infection (TBI) and disease among HCWs in four healthcare facilities in Yogyakarta province in Indonesia, and explore risk factors for TBI. A cross-sectional TB screening study targeted all HCWs from four pre-selected facilities (1 hospital, 3 primary care) in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Voluntary screening included symptom assessment, Chest X-ray (CXR), Xpert MTB/RIF (if indicated) and tuberculin skin test (TST). Analyses were descriptive and included multivariable logistic regression. Of 792 HCWs, 681 consented (86%) to the screening; 59% (n = 401) were female, 62% were medical staff (n = 421), 77% worked in the one participating hospital (n = 524), and the median time working in the health sector was 13 years (IQR: 6-25 years). Nearly half had provided services for people with TB (46%, n = 316) and 9% reported ever having TB (n = 60). Among participants with presumptive TB (15%, n = 99/662), none were diagnosed microbiologically or clinically with active TB disease. TBI was detected in 25% (95% CI: 22-30; n = 112/441) of eligible HCWs with a TST result. A significant association was found between TB infection and being male (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 2.02 (95%CI: 1.29-3.17)), currently working in the participating hospital compared to primary care (aOR 3.15 (95%CI: 1.75-5.66)), and older age (1.05 OR increase per year of life between 19-73 years (95%CI: 1.02-1.06)). This study supports prioritisation of HCWs as a high-risk group for TB infection and disease, and the need for comprehensive prevention and control programs in Indonesia. Further, it identifies characteristics of HCWs in Yogyakarta at higher risk of TBI, who could be prioritised in screening programs if universal coverage of prevention and control measures cannot be achieved.","Main S, Triasih R, Greig J, Hidayat A, Brilliandi IB, Khodijah S, Chan G, Wilks N, Parry AE, Nababan B, du Cros P, Dwihardiani B",PLoS One,2023,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
34653233,Variation of tuberculosis prevalence across diagnostic approaches and geographical areas of Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) has contributed to a significant disease burden and economic loss worldwide. Given no gold standard for diagnosis, early identification of TB infection has been challenging. This study aimed to comparatively investigate the prevalence of TB across diagnostic approaches (sputum AFB, sputum culture, sputum genetic test, and chest x-ray) and geographical areas of Indonesia. METHODS: Participant demographic variables and TB screening test results were obtained from the Tuberculosis Unit, Health Research and Development Agency, Ministry of Health (HRDA-MoH). The prevalence of pulmonary TB in populations aged 15 years and over was calculated using TB cases as a numerator and populations aged 15 years and over as a denominator. Variations across geographical areas and diagnostic approaches were expressed as prevalence and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: A total of 67,944 records were reviewed. Based on bacteriological evidence, the prevalence of TB per 100,000 in Indonesia was 759 (95% CI: 589.7-960.8) with variations across areas: 913 (95% CI 696.7-1,176.7; Sumatra), 593 (95% CI 447.2-770.6; Java-Bali), and 842 (95% CI 634.7-1,091.8; other islands). Also, the prevalence of TB varied across diagnostic approaches: 256.5 (sputum AFB), 545 (sputum culture), 752.2 (chest x-ray), and 894.9 (sputum genetic test). Based on sputum AFB, the TB prevalence varied from 216.6 (95% CI 146.5-286.8; Java-Bali), 259.9 (95% CI 184.2-335.6; other islands) to 307.4 (95% CI 208.3-406.5; Sumatra). Based on sputum culture, the TB prevalence ranged from 487.9 (95% CI 433.6-548.6; Java-Bali), 635.9 (95% CI 564.9-715.1; Sumatra), to 2,129.8 (95% CI 1,664.0-2,735.6; other islands). Based on chest x-ray, the TB prevalence varied from 152.1 (95% CI 147.9-156.3; Java-Bali), 159.2 (95% CI 154.1-164.3; Sumatra), to 864 (95% CI 809-921.4; other islands). Based on sputum genetic test, the TB prevalence ranged from 838.7 (95% CI 748.4-900.8; Java-Bali), 875 (95% CI 775.4-934.2; Sumatra), to 941.2 (95% CI 663.6-992.3; other islands).

37055814,Stigma towards people with tuberculosis: a cross-cultural adaptation and validation of a scale in Indonesia.,"INTRODUCTION: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a highly stigmatised disease that can cause or exacerbate mental health disorders. Despite increased awareness of the importance of reducing TB stigma, validated tools to measure TB stigma remain scarce. This study aimed to culturally adapt and validate the Van Rie TB Stigma Scale in Indonesia, a country with the second largest TB incidence worldwide. METHODS: We validated the scale in three phases: translation, cultural adaptation, and psychometric evaluation. We invited diverse experts to an interdisciplinary panel for the cross-cultural adaptation, then performed a psychometric evaluation of the scale: exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, reliability analysis, and correlation analysis with Patient Health Questionnaire 9 [PHQ-9]. RESULTS: We culturally adapted the original scale's language and content during the translation and cultural adaptation phases. After psychometric evaluation with 401 participants in seven provinces of Indonesia, we removed two items. The new scale had two forms: (A) patient and (B) community perspective forms. Both forms had good internal consistency, with respective Cronbach's alpha values of 0.738 and 0.807. We identified three loading factors in Form A (disclosure, isolation, and guilty) and two loading factors in Form B (isolation and distancing). The scale showed correlation with PHQ-9 (Form A, rs = 0.347, p < 0.001; Form B, rs = 0). CONCLUSIONS: The culturally adapted Indonesian version of Van Rie's TB Stigma Scale is comprehensive, reliable, internally consistent, and valid. The scale is now ready for applied scale-up in research and practice to measure TB-stigma and evaluate the impact of TB-stigma reduction interventions in Indonesia.","Fuady A, Arifin B, Yunita F, Rauf S, Fitriangga A, Sugiharto A, Yani FF, Nasution HS, Putra IGAE, Mansyur M, Wingfield T",BMC Psychol,2023 Apr 13,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
36252800,Characteristics of Drug-sensitive and Drug-resistant Tuberculosis Cases among Adults at Tuberculosis Referral Hospitals in Indonesia.,"As Indonesia's rifampin resistance testing rates are lower than global testing rates per the 2020 WHO global tuberculosis (TB) report, prevalence of multidrug-resistant TB may be underestimated. Our study aimed to evaluate prevalence and patterns of TB drug resistance (DR) within Indonesia. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data collected from 2017-2018 as part of a cohort study of adults with presumed pulmonary TB at 7 DR-TB referral hospitals in Indonesia. Bacteriological examinations (acid-fast bacilli, GeneXpert, sputum culture) and drug-susceptibility testing were performed following the guidelines of the National TB Program. Of 447 participants with complete bacteriological examinations, 312 (69.8%) had positive sputum cultures for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The proportion of MDR and pre-extensively drug-resistant was higher in previously treated compared with newly diagnosed participants (52.5% [73/139] versus 15% [26/173]). Compared with drug-sensitive case, drug-resistant TB was associated with cavities. Given the difference between rates of DR in TB referral hospitals from our study compared with the WHO survey in 2019 that showed 17.7% and 3.3% DR among previously treated and newly diagnosed participants globally, further characterization of Indonesia's TB epidemiology in the general population is needed. Strategies, including public policies to optimize case finding, strengthen capacity for resistance testing, and prevent loss to follow-up will be critical to reduce the burden of TB in Indonesia.","Burhan E, Karyana M, Karuniawati A, Kusmiati T, Wibisono BH, Handayani D, Riyanto BS, Sajinadiyasa IGK, Sinaga BYM, Djaharuddin I, Indah Sugiyono R, Susanto NH, Diana A, Kosasih H, Lokida D, Neal A, Lau CY, Siddiqui S",Am J Trop Med Hyg,2022 Nov 14,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
38282780,Determinants of quality of life among people with HIV and tuberculosis in an underserved area in Indonesia: a cross-sectional study.,"INTRODUCTION: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) remain global health problems and impose a substantial reduction in people s quality of life (QoL). This study aimed to assess and compare the QoL in HIV and TB patients and factors associated with QoL between those groups. METHODS: a cross-sectional study was conducted at a hospital clinic in Jayapura, Indonesia, between December 2022 and March 2023. Those who were aged above 18 years, diagnosed with HIV or TB infection, have been taking HIV or TB medications for at least 3 months, and provided informed consent were eligible to participate. Patients  QoL was measured using the Bahasa Indonesia version of a validated 26-item World Health Organization Quality of Life - Brief (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire. RESULTS: a total of 365 patients with HIV and 125 with TB were included. The majority of participants were Papuan (75.9%) and aged 20 - 65 years (92.9%). More than half of the participants were female (56.5%), employed (50.8%), married (65.5%), and had family support (64.9%). Education level and social support were predictors of poor physical health in the HIV group, while ethnicity was a predictor in the TB group. Patients  age was associated with poor psychological health in HIV, whereas sex was the associated factor in TB patients. Ethnicity was the only predictor of poor social relationships in those with TB. Whereas patients  age was a predictor of poor environmental health in the HIV group, marital status, and education were predictors in the TB group. Finally, only social support was associated with poor general QoL in TB patients. CONCLUSION: tuberculosis (TB) patients had poorer QoL than those with HIV. There is a need for more awareness to support those receiving TB treatment. In addition, further research is needed to understand in more detail the determinants of patients with drug-resistant TB, TB with HIV, and drug-resistant TB-HIV, to ensure that interventions are designed to help them.","Sianturi EI, Izzah Z, Huda K, Sada EM, Perwitasari DA, Mantiri SYY, Gunawan E",Pan Afr Med J,2023,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
37789310,"Acceptability and feasibility of tuberculosis-diabetes mellitus screening implementation in private primary care clinics in Yogyakarta, Indonesia: a qualitative study.","BACKGROUND: The relationship between Tuberculosis (TB) and Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is intricate and intertwined, posing significant global health challenges. In addition, the increasing prevalence of DM worldwide raises concerns regarding the potential resurgence of tuberculosis. The implementation of tuberculosis prevention strategies is of the utmost importance, especially in countries like Indonesia that encounter a dual burden of TB and DM. The significance of TB screening in private primary care settings for patients with diabetes cannot be overstated. Implementing TB screening protocols in private primary care settings can assist in identifying diabetic patients with tuberculosis. Therefore, this study aims to explore the acceptability and feasibility of tuberculosis-diabetes mellitus screening implementation in private primary care clinics. METHODS: We conducted implementation research with an exploratory qualitative design. Fifteen healthcare professionals from five private primary health care clinics in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, participated in five focus groups. The discussions were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analyzed. As part of the feasibility assessment, surveys were conducted in each clinic. We conducted a thematic analysis in accordance with the theoretical framework of acceptability and the feasibility assessment. RESULTS: We identified that most private primary care clinics deemed the implementation of TB screening in DM patients acceptable and practicable. We revealed that the majority of diabetes patients enthusiastically accepted TB-DM screening services. In addition, we found that the healthcare professionals at the clinic are aware of the nature of the intervention and demonstrates a positive attitude despite a subtle burden. The stigma associated with COVID-19 has emerged as a new implementation barrier, joining TB stigma, lack of resources, and regulatory issues. We identify concealed and tiered screening as a potential method for enhancing the implementation of TB-DM screening. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of TB screening in DM patients in private primary care clinics had the potential to be acceptable and feasible. To achieve a successful implementation, consideration should be given to supporting factors, hindering factors, and strategies to improve TB screening in DM patients.","Prakoso DA, Istiono W, Mahendradhata Y, Arini M",BMC Public Health,2023 Oct 3,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
38459759,Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of high-dose isoniazid for the treatment of rifampicin- or multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Pharmacokinetic data on high-dose isoniazid for the treatment of rifampicin-/multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (RR/MDR-TB) are limited. We aimed to describe the pharmacokinetics of high-dose isoniazid, estimate exposure target attainment, identify predictors of exposures, and explore exposure-response relationships in RR/MDR-TB patients. METHODS: We performed an observational pharmacokinetic study, with exploratory pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses, in Indonesian adults aged 18-65 years treated for pulmonary RR/MDR-TB with standardized regimens containing high-dose isoniazid (10-15 mg/kg/day) for 9-11 months. Intensive pharmacokinetic sampling was performed after >/=2 weeks of treatment. Total plasma drug exposure (AUC0-24) and peak concentration (Cmax) were assessed using non-compartmental analyses. AUC0-24/MIC ratio of 85 and Cmax/MIC ratio of 17.5 were used as exposure targets. Multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses were used to identify predictors of drug exposures and responses, respectively. RESULTS: We consecutively enrolled 40 patients (median age 37.5 years). The geometric mean isoniazid AUC0-24 and Cmax were 35.4 h.mg/L and 8.5 mg/L, respectively. Lower AUC0-24 and Cmax values were associated (P < 0.05) with non-slow acetylator phenotype, and lower Cmax values were associated with male sex. Of the 26 patients with MIC data, less than 25% achieved the proposed targets for isoniazid AUC0-24/MIC (n = 6/26) and Cmax/MIC (n = 5/26). Lower isoniazid AUC0-24 values were associated with delayed sputum culture conversion (>2 months of treatment) [adjusted OR 0.18 (95% CI 0.04-0.89)]. CONCLUSIONS: Isoniazid exposures below targets were observed in most patients, and certain risk groups for low isoniazid exposures may require dose adjustment. The effect of low isoniazid exposures on delayed culture conversion deserves attention.","Yunivita V, Gafar F, Santoso P, Chaidir L, Soeroto AY, Meirina TN, Te Brake L, Menzies D, Aarnoutse RE, Ruslami R",J Antimicrob Chemother,2024 May 2,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
33721022,High risk of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection among medical and nursing students in Indonesia: a 1-year prospective study.,"BACKGROUND: Medical and nursing students entering their clinical programmes are at increased risk for tuberculosis (TB) in TB-endemic settings. Relatively little is known about Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection among such students in high-endemic countries. METHODS: We examined M. tuberculosis infection among medical and nursing students starting clinical training in Bandung, Indonesia using interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus. IGRA-negative students had a repeat test after 1 y and logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with IGRA positivity or conversion. RESULTS: There were 379 students included in this study: 248 (65.4%) were medical students and 131 (34.6%) were nursing students. Of 379 students, 70 (18.5%) were IGRA positive at baseline. Of 293 IGRA-negative students with 1-y results, 26 (8.9%) underwent IGRA conversion. Being a medical student (adjusted relative risk [ARR] 5.15 [95% confidence interval CI 1.82 to 14.59], p=0.002) and participation in sputum collection or bronchoscopy were associated with IGRA conversion (ARR 2.74 [95% CI 1.29 to 5.79], p=0.008).

35271642,"Cost and affordability of scaling up tuberculosis diagnosis using Xpert MTB/RIF testing in West Java, Indonesia.","In Indonesia, a significant number of tuberculosis (TB) cases may be missed, due to the low sensitivity and specificity of the currently used diagnostic algorithm. In this regard, the rapid molecular test using Xpert MTB/RIF, which has recently been introduced in Indonesia, can improve case detection. Thus, this study determined the cost and affordability of incorporating Xpert MTB/RIF testing for TB diagnosis. For this purpose, we estimated the costs (from the health system and societal perspectives) of reaching the TB detection target in Depok municipality, and applied the findings to the West Java province of Indonesia. The resources available for the health and TB program were also analyzed to support the decision to scale up the TB diagnosis using Xpert MTB/RIF testing. According to the results, the unit cost for TB diagnosis per person was USD 27.22 and USD 70.16 from the health system and societal perspectives, respectively. To reach the target of 109,843 TB cases for the 2020-2024 time period, Depok municipality would need USD 2,989,927 and USD 2,549,455 from the health system viewpoint, assuming the machine's lifespan of five and 10 years, respectively. Extrapolating these results to the West Java province, USD 56,353,833 would be necessary to test 2,076,413 cases from 2019 to 2024. However, in order to accelerate the case detection target up to 2024, West Java requires additional funds. The implication of the findings is that the central government must consider local capacity to accelerate TB case detection and ensure that the installation of Xpert MTB/RIF machines is included in the overall costs.","Nadjib M, Dewi RK, Setiawan E, Miko TY, Putri S, Hadisoemarto PF, Sari ER, Pujiyanto, Martina R, Syamsi LN",PLoS One,2022,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
19920300,Improving diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis among HIV/AIDS patients: literature review and experience in a teaching hospital in Indonesia.,"HIV infection hampers diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) because many pathogens cause pulmonary infection in HIV people and the load of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is lower in HIV patients. We conducted a literature review and prospectively examined clinical, radiological, and laboratory diagnosis of PTB in 71 HIV-patients (29 inpatients and 42 outpatients) in a teaching hospital in West Java, Indonesia. For both in- and outpatients, signs and symptoms were sensitive but not specific for PTB. Chest X-ray (CXR) was sensitive but less specific. Among hospitalized PTB suspects, 28,8% could not expectorate sputum. Compared to culture, ZN had a sensitivity of 11.1% and 66.7% for in- and outpatients, respectively. From the literature, fluorescence microscopy, liquid culture, and nucleic acid assays can improve diagnosis of PTB in HIV, while IFNg-release assays lack sensitivity, especially in advanced HIV. The current practice of using CXR and microscopy lacks sensitivity for diagnosing PTB in HIV patients. Sputum culture is more sensitive but slow. Fluorescence microscopy might be a quick, relatively sensitive and feasible option in Indonesia. However, because of the frequent absence of sputum, especially in patients with advanced HIV-AIDS patients, there is an urgent need for alternative diagnostic methods using blood or urine.","Rewata L, Rutherford M, Apriani L, Janssen W, Rahmadi A, Parwati I, Yuwono A, van Crevel R",Acta Med Indones,2009 Jul,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
37552679,"Nonadherence to anti-tuberculosis treatment, reasons and associated factors among pulmonary tuberculosis patients in the communities in Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is the world's major public health problem. We assessed the proportion, reasons, and associated factors for anti-TB treatment nonadherence in the communities in Indonesia. METHODS: This national coverage cross-sectional survey was conducted from 2013 to 2014 with stratified multi-stage cluster sampling. Based on the region and rural-urban location. The 156 clusters were distributed in 136 districts/cities throughout 33 provinces, divided into three areas. An eligible population of age >/=15 was interviewed to find TB symptoms and screened with a thorax x-ray. Those whose filtered result detected positive followed an assessment of Sputum microscopy, LJ culture, and Xpert MTB/RIF. Census officers asked all participants about their history of TB and their treatment-defined Nonadherence as discontinuation of anti-tuberculosis treatment for <6 months. Data were analyzed using STATA 14.0 (College Station, TX, USA). RESULTS: Nonadherence to anti-TB treatment proportion was 27.24%. Multivariate analysis identified behavioral factors significantly associated with anti-TB treatment nonadherence, such as smoking (OR = 1.78, 95% CI (1.47-2.16)); place of first treatment received: government hospital (OR = 1.45, 95% CI:1.06-1.99); private hospital (OR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.38-2.72); private practitioner (OR = 2.24, 95% CI: 1.56-3.23); socio-demographic and TB status included region: Sumatera (OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.05-1.98); other areas (OR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.30-2.61); low level of education (OR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.27-2.03); and current TB positive status (OR = 2.17, 95% CI: 1.26-3.73). CONCLUSIONS: Nonadherence to anti-TB drugs was highly related to the personal perception of the respondents, despite smoking, current TB status, a place for the first treatment, education, and region. The position of the first TB treatment at the private practitioner was significantly associated with the risk of Nonadherence to treatment.","Lolong DB, Aryastami NK, Kusrini I, Tobing KL, Tarigan I, Isfandari S, Senewe FP, Raflizar, Endah N, Sitorus N, Pangaribuan L, Simarmata OS, Ariati Y",PLoS One,2023,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
38820475,Clinical Features and Predictors of Treatment Outcome in Patients with Ocular Tuberculosis from the Netherlands and Indonesia: The OculaR TB in Low versus High Endemic Countries (ORTEC) Study.,"PURPOSE: To describe and compare clinical features, treatment approaches, and treatment outcomes of ocular tuberculosis (OTB) patients in the Netherlands, a low tuberculosis (TB)-endemic country, and Indonesia, a high TB-endemic country. We also aimed to identify predictors of treatment outcomes. METHODS: A medical chart review of 339 OTB patients (n = 93 from the Netherlands and n = 246 from Indonesia) was performed. The primary outcome was response to treatment, whether with or without anti-tubercular treatment, after six months of treatment initiation (good versus poor responders). RESULTS: Indonesian OTB patients displayed a higher prevalence of chest radiograph findings indicative of TB infection (p < 0.001) and concurrent active systemic TB (p = 0.011). Indonesian cohort exhibited a more acute and severe disease profile, including uveitis duration </= 3 months (p < 0.001), blindness (p < 0.001), anterior chamber (AC) cells >/= 2+ (p < 0.001), and posterior synechiae (p < 0.001). Overall proportions of good responders to treatment were 67.6% in the Netherlands and 71.5% in Indonesia. Presence of AC cell >/= 2+ (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.12, 95% CI: 1.09-4.14), choroidal lesions other than serpiginous-like choroiditis (SLC) or tuberculoma (aOR: 4.47, 95% CI: 1.18-16.90), and retinal vasculitis (aOR: 2.32, 95% CI: 1.10-4.90) at baseline were predictors for poor response to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a more severe initial clinical presentation in the Indonesian cohort, the overall treatment outcomes of OTB was comparable in both cohorts. Three baseline clinical features were identified as predictors of treatment outcomes.","Putera I, Ten Berge JCEM, Thiadens AAHJ, Dik WA, Agrawal R, van Hagen PM, La Distia Nora R, Rombach SM",Ocul Immunol Inflamm,2025 Jan,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
36099384,Pulmonary tuberculosis cases in pregnancy: perinatal outcomes and health promotion challenges in Indonesia.,"Tuberculosis remains a serious health problem in pregnant women. Tuberculosis during pregnancy is related to poor perinatal outcomes, including low birth weight, insufficient growth relative to gestational age, perinatal mortality, and maternal morbidity and mortality. Additionally, diabetes mellitus in pregnant women with tuberculosis is associated with a higher risk of maternal and fetal complications such as preeclampsia, preterm birth, hypoglycemia, and giant baby. We report two perinatal outcomes of (1) pregnancy during tuberculosis treatment and (2) tuberculosis in a pregnant woman with diabetes mellitus. Both women completed anti-tuberculosis treatments. This report emphasizes the importance of health promotion through family planning among women with tuberculosis. This case report also underscores the increased risk of developing tuberculosis in pregnant women with diabetes mellitus. Early diagnosis of tuberculosis in pregnant women is vital as it affects the health of both mother and child.","Rahmawati A, Judistiani RTD, Setiawati DA, Fajri R, Putri S, Ruslami R",J Infect Dev Ctries,2022 Aug 30,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
37841718,Development and validation of assessment instrument for the perception and attitude toward tuberculosis among the general population in Indonesia: a Rasch analysis of psychometric properties.,"INTRODUCTION: Tuberculosis (TB)-related knowledge is an important evaluation metric for health education interventions. Factor analysis is limited when used on ordinal scales and does not provide in-depth item function examinations, whereas Rasch analysis addresses these limitations and offers potential advantages such as generalizability, testing of unidimensionality, producing an ordered set of items, and identifying poorly functioning items. Therefore, this research aims to develop a reliable and valid measure of perception and attitude toward TB (PATT) for public application use Rasch Analysis. METHODS: A questionnaire-based survey was conducted on the Indonesian general population using the Google Form platform. Rasch analysis was then employed to examine the psychometric properties and develop the final items of PATT. RESULTS: Experts from across the TB community participated in the PATT development, producing an initial scale of 16 items. Up to 1,616 participants completed the PATT questionnaire, where 74.8% were female, and 5% had a TB history. The final unidimensional 16-item scale has an item reliability of 1.00 for the two components (perception and attitude), a person reliability index of 0.87 and 0.60, as well as a Cronbach's test reliability of 0.88 and 0.88 for perception and attitude, respectively. CONCLUSION: The PATT is a unidimensional scale with good construct validity and internal consistency. It has the potential to be useful for the assessment of TB perception and attitude in research and clinical practice.","Pitaloka DAE, Kusuma IY, Pratiwi H, Pradipta IS",Front Public Health,2023,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
33765092,Development and performance of CUHAS-ROBUST application for pulmonary rifampicin-resistance tuberculosis screening in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Diagnosis of Pulmonary Rifampicin Resistant Tuberculosis (RR-TB) with the Drug-Susceptibility Test (DST) is costly and time-consuming. Furthermore, GeneXpert for rapid diagnosis is not widely available in Indonesia. This study aims to develop and evaluate the CUHAS-ROBUST model performance, an artificial-intelligence-based RR-TB screening tool. METHODS: A cross-sectional study involved suspected all type of RR-TB patients with complete sputum Lowenstein Jensen DST (reference) and 19 clinical, laboratory, and radiology parameter results, retrieved from medical records in hospitals under the Faculty of Medicine, Hasanuddin University Indonesia, from January 2015-December 2019. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models were built along with other classifiers. The model was tested on participants recruited from January 2020-October 2020 and deployed into CUHAS-ROBUST (index test) application. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were obtained for assessment. RESULTS: A total of 487 participants (32 Multidrug-Resistant/MDR 57 RR-TB, 398 drug-sensitive) were recruited for model building and 157 participants (23 MDR and 21 RR) in prospective testing. The ANN full model yields the highest values of accuracy (88% (95% CI 85-91)), and sensitivity (84% (95% CI 76-89)) compare to other models that show sensitivity below 80% (Logistic Regression 32%, Decision Tree 44%, Random Forest 25%, Extreme Gradient Boost 25%). However, this ANN has lower specificity among other models (90% (95% CI 86-93)) where Logistic Regression demonstrates the highest (99% (95% CI 97-99)). This ANN model was selected for the CUHAS-ROBUST application, although still lower than the sensitivity of global GeneXpert results (87.5%). CONCLUSION: The ANN-CUHAS ROBUST outperforms other AI classifiers model in detecting all type of RR-TB, and by deploying into the application, the health staff can utilize the tool for screening purposes particularly at the primary care level where the GeneXpert examination is not available.

34332626,"Genetic variation of ABCB1 (rs1128503, rs1045642) and CYP2E1 rs3813867 with the duration of tuberculosis therapy: a pilot study among tuberculosis patients in Indonesia.","OBJECTIVE: The risk of contracting tuberculosis (TB) and the efficacy of TB therapy are affected by several factors, including genetic variation among populations. In the Indonesian population, data on the genes involved in drug transport and metabolism of TB therapy are limited. The aim of this study was to identify the genetic profile of the ABCB1 gene (rs1128503 and rs1045642) and CYP2E1 gene (rs3813867) in Indonesians with TB. This study was a cross-sectional study of 50 TB outpatients in Jambi city, Indonesia. Sociodemographic characteristics were obtained from medical records. Whole blood was collected, and genomic DNA was isolated. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were determined using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism with HaeIII, MboI, and PstI for rs1128503, rs1045642 (ABCB1), and rs3813867 (CYP2E1), respectively. RESULT: The frequency of alleles of each gene was analyzed by Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The genetic profiles of ABCB1 rs1128503 and rs1045642 were varied (CC, CT, TT), while CYP2E1 rs3813867 was present in CC (wild type). The genetic variations of ABCB1 and CYP2E1 may have no significant correlation with the duration of TB therapy. Nevertheless, this study may provide as preliminary results for the genetic profiles of ABCB1 (rs1128503, rs1045642) and CYP2E1 (rs3813867) in the Indonesia population.","Barliana MI, Kusuma ASW, Insani WN, Alfian SD, Diantini A, Mutakin M, Rostinawati T, Herlambang H, Puspitasari IM, Suwantika AA, Abdulah R",BMC Res Notes,2021 Jul 31,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
32127111,Estimation of subnational tuberculosis burden: generation and application of a new tool in Indonesia.,"SETTING: In many high tuberculosis (TB) burden countries, there is substantial geographical heterogeneity in TB burden. In addition, decisions on TB funding and policy are highly decentralised. Subnational estimates of burden, however, are usually unavailable for planning and target setting.OBJECTIVE and DESIGN: We developed a statistical model termed SUBsET to estimate the distribution of the national TB incidence through a weighted score using selected variables, and applied the model to the 514 districts in Indonesia, which have substantial policy and budgetary autonomy in TB. Estimated incidence was compared to reported facility and domicile-based notifications to estimate the case detection rate (CDR). Local stakeholders led model development and dissemination.RESULTS: The final SUBsET model included district population size, level of urbanisation, socio-economic indicators (living floor space and high school completion), human immunodeficiency virus prevalence and air pollution. We estimated district-level TB incidence to be between 201 and 2,485/100 000/year. The facility-based CDR varied between 0 and 190%, with high variation between neighbouring districts, suggesting strong cross-district health utilisation, which was confirmed by domicile-based CDR estimation. SUBsET results informed district-level TB action plans across Indonesia.CONCLUSION: The SUBsET model could be used to estimate the subnational burden in high-burden countries and inform TB policymaking at the relevant decentralised administrative level.","Parwati CG, Farid MN, Nasution HS, Basri C, Lolong D, Gebhard A, Tiemersma EW, Pambudi I, Surya A, Houben RMGJ",Int J Tuberc Lung Dis,2020 Feb 1,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
25690530,Active and latent tuberculosis among HIV-positive injecting drug users in Indonesia.,"INTRODUCTION: Injecting drug use (IDU) is associated with tuberculosis but few data are available from low-income settings. We examined IDU in relation to active and latent tuberculosis (LTBI) among HIV-positive individuals in Indonesia, which has a high burden of tuberculosis and a rapidly growing HIV epidemic strongly driven by IDU. METHODS: Active tuberculosis was measured prospectively among 1900 consecutive antiretroviral treatment (ART)-naive adult patients entering care in a clinic in West Java. Prevalence of LTBI was determined cross-sectionally in a subset of 518 ART-experienced patients using an interferon-gamma release assay. RESULTS: Patients with a history of IDU (53.1%) more often reported a history of tuberculosis treatment (34.8% vs. 21.9%, p < 0.001), more often received tuberculosis treatment during follow-up (adjusted HR = 1.71; 95% CI: 1.25-2.35) and more often had bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis (OR = 1.67; 95% CI: 0.94-2.96). LTBI was equally prevalent among people with and without a history of IDU (29.1 vs. 30.4%, NS). The risk estimates did not change after adjustment for CD4 cell count or ART. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-positive individuals with a history of IDU in Indonesia have more active tuberculosis, with similar rates of LTBI. Within the HIV clinic, LTBI screening and isoniazid preventive therapy may be prioritized to patients with a history of IDU.","Meijerink H, Wisaksana R, Lestari M, Meilana I, Chaidir L, van der Ven AJ, Alisjahbana B, van Crevel R",J Int AIDS Soc,2015,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
26928217,The path to impact of operational research on tuberculosis control policies and practices in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Operational research is currently one of the pillars of the global strategy to control tuberculosis. Indonesia initiated capacity building for operational research on tuberculosis over the last decade. Although publication of the research in peer-reviewed journals is an important indicator for measuring the success of this endeavor, the influence of operational research on policy and practices is considered even more important. However, little is known about the process by which operational research influences tuberculosis control policy and practices. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the influence of operational research on tuberculosis control policy and practice in Indonesia between 2004 and 2014. DESIGN: Using a qualitative study design, we conducted in-depth interviews of 50 researchers and 30 policy makers/program managers and performed document reviews. Transcripts of these interviews were evaluated while applying content analysis. RESULTS: Operational research contributed to tuberculosis control policy and practice improvements, including development of new policies, introduction of new practices, and reinforcement of current program policies and practices. However, most of these developments had limited sustainability. The path from the dissemination of research results and recommendations to policy and practice changes was long and complex. The skills, interests, and political power of researchers and policy makers, as well as health system response, could influence the process. CONCLUSIONS: Operational research contributed to improving tuberculosis control policy and practices. A systematic approach to improve the sustainability of the impact of operational research should be explored.","Probandari A, Widjanarko B, Mahendradhata Y, Sanjoto H, Cerisha A, Nungky S, Riono P, Simon S, Farid MN, Giriputra S, Putra AE, Burhan E, Wahyuni CU, Mustikawati D, Widianingrum C, Tiemersma EW, Alisjahbana B",Glob Health Action,2016,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
39816109,"Tuberculosis treatment outcomes and associated factors: A retrospective study in West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia.","Successfully treating tuberculosis (TB) could significantly help reduce its spread. The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with successful TB treatment. A retrospective study was conducted in West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia, using data from the National TB Information System (SITB) covering patients from January 1 to December 31, 2022. Patients were classified into two groups: those with successful treatment outcomes (cured or completed treatment) and those with unsuccessful outcomes (including treatment failure, loss to follow-up, or death). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with treatment outcomes, providing odds ratios (OR) and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A total of 2,225 TB patients (1,382 males and 843 females) were included in the study. Of these, 2,048 (92.1%) achieved successful treatment outcomes. Univariate analysis indicated that older age (OR: 0.47; 95%CI: 0.28-0.78) and a high number of AFB in sputum smears (OR: 0.23; 95%CI: 0.09-0.66) were associated with a higher likelihood of unsuccessful TB treatment. In contrast, having no HIV infection (OR: 13.44; 95%CI: 6.22-29.08), clinical TB cases (diagnosed clinically rather than bacteriologically) (OR: 1.50; 95%CI: 1.04-2.20) and longer duration of TB treatments were associated with successful treatment outcomes. Multivariate analysis suggested that the TB treatment durations of 4-6 months (aOR: 1256.95; 95%CI: 431.89-3658.19) and 7-12 months (aOR: 575.5; 95%CI: 99.1-3342.06) were associated with a significantly higher likelihood of success compared to durations of 0-3 months. In conclusion, this study highlights that a minimum treatment duration of three months was crucial for increasing the likelihood of successful TB treatment. These findings emphasize the importance of comprehensive support programs to ensure adherence to treatment guidelines and improve outcomes.","Meiyanti M, Bachtiar A, Kusumaratna RK, Alfiyyah A, Machrumnizar M, Pusparini P",Narra J,2024 Dec,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
30818352,Evaluation of Xpert MTB-RIF guided diagnosis and treatment of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis in Indonesia: A retrospective cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: Rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB) is largely underdetected in Indonesia. Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) has recently been introduced, prioritizing patients at risk of RR-TB, followed by phenotypic drug-susceptibility (DST) if rifampicin resistance is detected. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated Xpert-based management of presumptive RR-TB cases under routine practice in West Java, Indonesia. METHODS: We examined all records of patients tested with Xpert in the referral hospital for West Java in 2015-2016. We measured loss across a limited cascade of care, time to Xpert diagnosis and the commencement of initial second-line treatment, and identified factors associated with diagnostic and treatment delay. Additionally, we analyzed the appropriateness of treatment according to DST results. RESULTS: Of 3415 patients with presumptive RR-TB, 3215 (94%) were tested by Xpert, of whom 339 (10.5%) were diagnosed as RR-TB. 288 (85%) of 339 RR-TB patients started initial second-line TB treatment, with 48 (14%) patients being lost between diagnosis and pre-treatment assessment. Second-line treatment was commenced at a median of 41 days (IQR 29-70) after RR-TB diagnosis. Delays in both diagnosis and treatment initiation were observed in 104 (52%) of 201 RR-TB patients with identifiable referral date. Rural residence was associated with delay to diagnosis (adjusted OR 2.7; 95%CI 1.5-5.2) and treatment initiation (adjusted OR 2.0; 1.2-3.4). Of 162 patients with available DST result, 107 (66%) had multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and 32 (20%) had either pre-extensively drug resistant (pre-XDR) or extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). We estimated that with the current algorithm 41% of pre-XDR or XDR-TB patients are diagnosed, and 33% of them started on an appropriate treatment regimen. CONCLUSIONS: Many patients with Xpert-diagnosed RR-TB either do not start MDR-TB treatment or encountered diagnostic and treatment delays under programmatic conditions in Indonesia, and most pre-XDR and XDR-TB cases remain undiagnosed. Further expansion and ongoing quality improvement of RR-TB services are urgently needed.","Soeroto AY, Lestari BW, Santoso P, Chaidir L, Andriyoko B, Alisjahbana B, van Crevel R, Hill PC",PLoS One,2019,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
26297576,Molecular epidemiology study of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its susceptibility to anti-tuberculosis drugs in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Genotyping of Mycobacterium tuberculosis helps to understand the molecular epidemiology of tuberculosis and to address evolutionary questions about the disease spread. Certain genotypes also have implications for the spread of infection and treatment. Indonesia is a very diverse country with a population with multiple ethnicities and cultures and a history of many trade and tourism routes. This study describes the first attempt to map the molecular epidemiology of TB in the Indonesian archipelago. METHOD: From 2008 to 2011, 404 clinical specimens from sputum-smear (SS+) TB patients, age >/=15 years, were collected from 16 TB referral primary health centers (PHC) in 16 provincial capitals in Indonesia. Susceptibility testing to first line drugs was conducted for 262 samples using the agar proportion method as per WHO guidelines. Spoligotyping was done on all samples. RESULTS: Ninety-three of the 404 samples (23 %) were from the Beijing family, making it the predominant family in the country. However, the geographic distribution of the family varied by region with 86/294 (29.3 %) in the western region, 6/72 (8.3 %) in the central region, and 2/72 (2.8 %) in the eastern region (p < 0.001). The predominant genotype in the central and eastern regions was from the East-African-Indian (EAI) family, comprising 15.3 % (11/72), and 26.3 % (10/38) of the isolates, respectively. Drug susceptibility to first-line anti-TB drugs was tested in 262 isolates. 162 (61.8 %) isolates were susceptible to all TB drugs, 70 (26.7 %) were mono-resistant 16 (6.1 %) were poly-resistant, and 14 (5.4 %) were multi-drug resistant (MDR). The proportion of Beijing family isolates in the susceptible, mono-resistant, poly-resistant, and MDR groups was 33/162 (20.4 %), 28/70 (40.0 %), 6/16 (37.5 %), and 3/14 (21.4 %), respectively. Overall, resistance of the Beijing family isolates to any of the first line TB drugs was significantly higher than non-Beijing families [37/71 (52.1 %) vs. 63/191 (33.0 %) (p-value = 0.003)]. CONCLUSION: The distribution of Mycobacterium tuberculosis genotypes in Indonesia showed high genetic diversity and tended to vary by geographic regions. Drug susceptibility testing confirmed that the Beijing family of M.tb in Indonesia exhibited greater resistance to first line anti-TB drugs than did other families.","Lisdawati V, Puspandari N, Rif'ati L, Soekarno T, M M, K S, Ratnasari L, Izzatun N, Parwati I",BMC Infect Dis,2015 Aug 22,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
26133548,Smoking cessation and smokefree environments for tuberculosis patients in Indonesia-a cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: Research indicates that smoking substantially increases the risk of tuberculosis (TB), delay in diagnosis, failure of TB treatment and death from TB. Quitting smoking is one of the best ways to prevent unwanted outcomes. Exposure to secondhand smoke increases the risks of both TB infection and development of active TB disease among children and adults. TB patients who smoke in the home are also placing their families at a greater risk of TB infection. It is very important to keep homes smokefree. The present study assessed the implementation and effectiveness of an intervention that promotes smoking cessation and smokefree environments for TB patients. METHODS: All consecutive new sputum smear-positive TB patients (aged >/= 15 years old) diagnosed and registered in 17 health centres between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2012 were enrolled. The ABC (A=ask, B=brief advice, C=cessation support) intervention was offered for 5 to 10 minutes within DOTS services at each visit. Smoking status and smokefree environments at home were assessed at the first visit, each monthly follow up and at month six. Factors associated with quitting were analysed by univariable and multivariable analysis RESULTS: Of the 750 TB patients registered, 582 (77.6%) were current smokers, 40 (5.3%) were ex-smokers and 128 (17.1%) were never smokers. Of the 582 current smokers, 66.8% had quit smoking at month six. A time from waking to first cigarette of >30 minutes, having a smokefree home and the display of ""no smoking"" signage at home at month six were significantly associated with quitting. Of the 750 TB patients, 86.1% had created a smokefree home at six month follow-up compared with 18.5% at baseline. All 80 health facilities were 100% tobacco-free at the end of 2012 compared with only 52 (65%) when the intervention began in March 2011. CONCLUSIONS: Brief advice of 5-10 minutes with minimal cessation support at every visit of TB patients resulted in high quit rates and higher awareness of adverse health effects of secondhand smoke exposure, which led patients to make their homes smokefree and health providers to make health care tobacco-free.","Bam TS, Aditama TY, Chiang CY, Rubaeah R, Suhaemi A",BMC Public Health,2015 Jul 2,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia

34802420,"The whole-genome sequencing in predicting Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug susceptibility and resistance in Papua, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis is one of the deadliest disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Its treatment still becomes a burden for many countries including Indonesia. Drug resistance is one of the problems in TB treatment. However, a development in the molecular field through Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can be used as a solution in detecting mutations associated with TB- drugs. This investigation intended to implement this data for supporting the scientific community in deeply understanding any TB epidemiology and evolution in Papua along with detecting any mutations in genes associated with TB-Drugs. RESULT: A whole-genome sequencing was performed on the random samples from TB Referral Laboratory in Papua utilizing MiSeq 600 cycle Reagent Kit (V3). Furthermore, TBProfiler was used for genome analysis, RAST Server was employed for annotation, while Gview server was applied for BLAST genome mapping and a Microscope server was implemented for Regions of Genomic Plasticity (RGP). The largest genome of M. tuberculosis obtained was at the size of 4,396,040 bp with subsystems number at 309 and the number of coding sequences at 4326. One sample (TB751) contained one RGP. The drug resistance analysis revealed that several mutations associated with TB-drug resistance existed. In details, mutations of rpoB gene which were identified as S450L, D435Y, H445Y, L430P, and Q432K had caused the reduced effectiveness of rifampicin; while the mutases in katG (S315T), kasA (312S), inhA (I21V), and Rv1482c-fabG1 (C-15 T) genes had contributed to the resistance in isoniazid. In streptomycin, the resistance was triggered by the mutations in rpsL (K43R) and rrs (A514C, A514T) genes, and, in Amikacin, its resistance was led by mutations in rrs (A514C) gene. Additionally, in Ethambutol and Pyrazinamide, their reduced effectiveness was provoked by embB gene mutases (M306L, M306V, D1024N) and pncA (W119R). CONCLUSIONS: The results from whole-genome sequencing of TB clinical sample in Papua, Indonesia could contribute to the surveillance of TB-drug resistance. In the drug resistance profile, there were 15 Multi Drugs Resistance (MDR) samples. However, Extensively Drug-resistant (XDR) samples have not been found, but samples were resistant to only Amikacin, a second-line drug.","Maladan Y, Krismawati H, Wahyuni T, Tanjung R, Awaludin K, Audah KA, Parikesit AA",BMC Genomics,2021 Nov 22,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia

The most common lineage found among all isolates was East-African Indian (n = 66, 33.7%), followed by Euro-American (n = 38, 19.4%). Drug resistance mutations were more common among Beijing strains than other lineages. Of the 30 drug-resistant isolates, 12 (40.0%) fell into four clusters that were separate from drug-susceptible clusters as determined using MIRU-VNTR. CONCLUSIONS: These are the first genotypic drug resistance data from Jayapura, Papua, showing moderate rates of resistance to first-line drugs and likely transmission of drug-resistant TB.","Chaidir L, Sengstake S, de Beer J, Krismawati H, Lestari FD, Ayawaila S, van Soolingen D, Anthony R, van Crevel R, Alisjahbana B",Int J Tuberc Lung Dis,2015 Apr,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
37727963,Viral Load and CD4(+) Markers as Determinants of Tuberculosis Coinfection Among People Living with HIV/AIDS in Papua Indonesia.,"Tuberculosis (TB) infection causes mortality among People Living with HIV (PLHIV), so the treatment of TB-HIV coinfection is crucial. The study aimed to identify the determinants contributing to TB coinfection among PLHIV in Papua. It is a descriptive-analytic study with a cross-sectional design involving 188 PLHIV at the four hospitals in Papua. CD4(+) was carried out using CD4(+) counter and viral load using the qPCR technique. A logistic regression test and R statistic with a significance level of 0.05 were used to analyze the determinants of TB coinfection among PLHIV. PLHIV having CD4(+) count of fewer than 350 cells/mm(3) had a 17.8 times higher risk for TB-HIV coinfection, P-value = 0.0. In addition, a viral load of more than 10 000 copies/ml will be 12.1 times more likely to be co-infected with TB-HIV compared to those who have a viral load of fewer than 10 000 copies/ml, P-value = 0.0. CD4(+) markers and viral load are factors that play a role in TB coinfection among PLHIV in Papua Province.","Widiyanti M, Adiningsih S, Kridaningsih TN, Fitrianingtyas R",Asia Pac J Public Health,2023 Nov,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
27595779,"The socioeconomic impact of multidrug resistant tuberculosis on patients: results from Ethiopia, Indonesia and Kazakhstan.","BACKGROUND: One of the main goals of the post-2015 global tuberculosis (TB) strategy is that no families affected by TB face catastrophic costs. We revised an existing TB patient cost measurement tool to specifically also measure multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB patients' costs and applied it in Ethiopia, Indonesia and Kazakhstan. METHODS: Through structured interviews with TB and MDR-TB patients in different stages of treatment, we collected data on the direct (out of pocket) and indirect (loss of income) costs of patients and their families related to the diagnosis and treatment of TB and MDR-TB. Direct costs included costs for hospitalization, follow-up tests, transport costs for health care visits, and food supplements. Calculation of indirect costs was based on time needed for diagnosis and treatment. Costs were extrapolated over the patient's total treatment phase. RESULTS: In total 406 MDR-TB patients and 197 other TB patients were included in the survey: 169 MDR-TB patients and 25 other TB patients in Ethiopia; 143 MDR-TB patients and 118 TB patients in Indonesia; and 94 MDR-TB patients and 54 other TB patients in Kazakhstan. Total costs for diagnosis and current treatment episode for TB patients were estimated to be USD 260 in Ethiopia, USD 169 in Indonesia, and USD 929 in Kazakhstan, compared to USD 1838, USD 2342, and USD 3125 for MDR-TB patients, respectively. These costs represented 0.82-4.6 months of pre-treatment household income for TB patients and 9.3-24.9 months for MDR-TB patients. Importantly, 38-92 % reported income loss and 26-76 % of TB patients lost their jobs due to (MDR) TB illness, further aggravating the financial burden. CONCLUSIONS: The financial burden of MDR-TB is alarming, although all TB patients experienced substantial socioeconomic impact of the disease. If the patient is the breadwinner of the family, the combination of lost income and extra costs is generally catastrophic. Therefore, it should be a priority of the government to relieve the financial burden based on the cost mitigation options identified.","van den Hof S, Collins D, Hafidz F, Beyene D, Tursynbayeva A, Tiemersma E",BMC Infect Dis,2016 Sep 5,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
39312636,"Clinical Features, Adverse Events and Treatment Outcomes of Multidrug/Rifampicin-resistant Tuberculosis in Children and Adolescents: An Eight-year Retrospective Cohort Study in Bandung, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: Data on childhood and adolescent multidrug/rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/RR-TB) in Indonesia are lacking. We aimed to assess clinical features, adverse events (AEs) and treatment outcomes of childhood and adolescent MDR/RR-TB. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed in children and adolescents <18 years old treated for MDR/RR-TB at Hasan Sadikin General Hospital in Bandung, Indonesia, between June 2016 and March 2024. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for predictors of all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Among 84 included patients, 69 (82%) were adolescents 10-17 years of age, 54 (64%) were female, 54 (64%) were malnourished and 55 (65%) had culture-confirmed disease. Among 69 (82%) patients with known outcomes, 48 (70%) were successfully treated, 14 (20%) died (including 5 pretreatment deaths) and 7 (10%) were lost to follow-up (LTFU) (including 5 pretreatment LTFU). Predictors of all-cause mortality included shortness of breath on admission [aOR: 6.4, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.3-49.1], high bacillary burden on Xpert MTB/RIF assay (aOR: 17.0, 95% CI: 1.6-260.5) and the presence of lung cavities on chest radiograph (aOR: 4.8, 95% CI: 1.1-23.3). Among 74 patients who initiated treatment, 39 (53%) had at least one grade 1-2 AE, and 4 (5%) had one grade 3-4 AE each, including hepatotoxicity, QT prolongation, hearing loss and rash/hyperpigmentation. CONCLUSION: Younger children were underrepresented among those treated for MDR/RR-TB, indicating reduced access to care. Severe AEs were uncommon during MDR/RR-TB treatment. Baseline indicators of extensive disease were associated with all-cause mortality. The high proportion of pre-treatment mortality and LTFU may reflect complex patient pathways limiting access to care.","Nataprawira HM, Gafar F, Sari CA, Alffenaar JC, Marais BJ, Ruslami R, Menzies D",Pediatr Infect Dis J,2025 Feb 1,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
38213049,"The Profile of Multidrug Tuberculosis Regimen and Treatment Outcomes in Pulmonary MDR-TB Patients at the Tertiary Referral Hospital Dr. Soetomo, East Java, Indonesia: A Seven-Year Retrospective Study on Bedaquiline.","BACKGROUND: The use of bedaquiline has been reported to minimize the number of lost to follow-up and fewer rejections from the patients. This study is the first to depict the use of bedaquiline. It aims to provide information related to the profile of the MDR-TB drug regimen in the last 7 years with the treatment outcomes of pulmonary MDR-TB patients at a tertiary referral hospital in East Java. METHODS: This study was a retrospective, descriptive, and data analysis on 1053 pulmonary MDR-TB patients in tertiary referral hospital Dr Soetomo, East Java, Indonesia, with the SPSS software version 25 and Microsoft Excel 2021. RESULTS: The study analyzed the  MDR-TB treatment regimen following the latest guidelines from WHO (2020) at a tertiary referral hospital in East Java. This study shows that a bedaquiline-containing regimen started in January 2015 to July 2022 with the percentage of distribution (1, 3, 11, 4, 18, 13, 29, 21)% consecutively in the regimen. The treatment outcome profile of MDR-TB patients shows the average percentage of cured (15%), died (12%), lost-to-follow-up cases (27%), moved to an individualized regimen or a different health facility (42%), and currently in the evaluation stage (4%). Overall from January 2017 to July 2022, the number of LTFU cases decreased (42, 46, 29, 19, 8, 4)%. However, the cured case fluctuated between 2017-2022 (16, 28, 26, 32)%  respectively after Bdq started to be included in the regimen regularly for treating RR/MDR-TB. CONCLUSION: After seven years of study, we revealed an association between adding bedaquiline to the regimen and the treatment success and decreasing lost-to-follow-up cases.","Setyawan MF, Mertaniasih NM, Soedarsono S",Acta Med Indones,2023 Oct,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
31439181,Impact of pharmacist counseling and leaflet on the adherence of pulmonary tuberculosis patients in lungs hospital in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: One of the goals of counseling in patients with chronic diseases including tuberculosis patients is to improve adherence to taking medication. By patient adherence, therapeutic results are more optimal. Additional counseling alternatives such as leaflets may be needed to make easier for patients to obtain information about their treatment. This study aimed to analyze the effectiveness of counseling with and without leaflets on the adherence on taking tuberculosis (TB) drugs. METHODS: This study was a quantitative research conducted using a quasi-experiment method with a control group for pre-test and post-test design. Data was taken by consecutive sampling. The number of samples in this study was 75 respondents which divided into three groups: counseling, counseling with leaflets, and control that is a usual care in hospital. The inclusion criteria were patients diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis with age 25-55 years, who has been taking TB medicines for at least one month and can communicate well. Data was analyzed using Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis with post hoc Mann-Whitney due to abnormality of the distributed data. RESULTS: Before the intervention, of 20 respondents (42.6%) out of 75 respondents were obedient to their TB medicines, whereas after the intervention the number of obedient patients was 33 respondents (70.2%). There was a significant increase in adherence between before and after two weeks of counseling intervention with a p-value of 0.029 before and after two weeks of counseling with leaflets with a p-value of 0.003. Counseling and counseling with leaflets improved patients' adherence compare to control group with p-values of 0.028 and 0.001 respectively. CONCLUSION: Counseling and counseling with leaflet impact in patients' adherence to tuberculosis medication.","Karuniawati H, Putra ON, Wikantyasning ER",Indian J Tuberc,2019 Jul,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
31421107,"Characteristic profile of antibody responses to PPD, ESAT-6, and CFP-10 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in pulmonary tuberculosis suspected cases in Surabaya, Indonesia.","Accurate and rapid diagnostic tools are important aspects of managing tuberculosis (TB) cases appropriately. However, the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic kits based on immune response such as the tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) are still debated. Thus, the exploration and assessment of specific biomarker-targeted antibodies are needed for the development of an accurate and rapid diagnostic tool. The present study was conducted in patients with a respiratory problem suspected to be TB at Dr. Soetomo Hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia. Among 102 patients tested by GeneXpert and AFB, 59 serum samples were from cases retrospectively determined to have active TB. A total of 102 serum of healthy controls (HC) was also collected. The PPD antigen and the recombinant CFP-10 and ESAT-6 proteins were prepared. Antibody responses against these proteins were evaluated by ELISA. All samples were also screened for the possibility of Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) infection using Capilla MaC kit. The results showed that TB patients had a significantly higher concentration of IgG antibody in response to PPD than the HC. In addition, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that PPD was acceptable for diagnostic purposes with an AUC value of 0.835 (95% CI 0.770-0.900, p < 0.0001). However, ESAT-6 and CFP-10 had low AUCs, and 32 samples from both groups showed a low concentration of IgA antibody against all antigens. The MAC detection results also showed that the concentration of IgA in the HC group was the highest. The current results indicate that PPD is a better antigen for antibody-based detection of TB than ESAT-6 and CFP-10. Based on the MAC detection assay, 53 people in the HC group were probably infected with rapidly growing nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), although antibody response to PPD was low.","Dewi DNSS, Mertaniasih NM, Soedarsono, Ozeki Y, Artama WT, Fihiruddin, Niki M, Tateishi Y, Ato M, Matsumoto S",Braz J Infect Dis,2019 Jul-Aug,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
38194897,"Analysis of Health-Related Quality of Life and Incurred Costs Among Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Tuberculosis, and Tuberculosis/HIV Coinfected Outpatients in Indonesia.","OBJECTIVES: A growing interest in healthcare costs and patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) exists in the context of the increasing importance of health technology assessment in countries with high numbers of the HIV and tuberculosis (TB) patient populations, such as Indonesia. This study aimed to analyze the HRQoL and out-of-pocket (OOP) costs of HIV, TB, and TB/HIV coinfected participants in a city in Indonesia with a high prevalence of HIV and TB. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in the voluntary counseling and testing and lung clinics of Bekasi City Public Hospital (Indonesia) from January to March 2018. Patients' HRQoL was measured using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, whereas OOP costs were extracted from a semistructured questionnaire. RESULTS: Of the 460 eligible participants, 82% resided in the city, 48% of them were married, and their median age was 34 years. Less than half were insured, and more than half had no source of income. The median values of health utilities for participants with HIV, TB, and TB/HIV were perceived as potentially high (1.0, 0.9, and 0.8, respectively). The TB/HIV coinfected outpatients had the highest OOP costs (US$94.5), with the largest contribution coming from direct medical OOP expenditures. Taking loans from family members was adopted as a financial strategy to overcome inadequate household incomes and high treatment costs. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that TB/HIV coinfection potentially lowers HRQoL and increases healthcare costs and the need for economic analysis to underpin cost-effective treatment in such patients.","Idrus LR, Fitria N, Purba FD, Alffenaar JC, Postma MJ",Value Health Reg Issues,2024 May,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
31625291,Good Agreement between an Interferon Gamma Release Assay and Tuberculin Skin Tests in Testing for Latent Tuberculosis Infection among HIV-Infected Patients in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Latent tuberculosis infection is a condition where there is a persistent immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis without clinical manifestations of tuberculosis. Currently, there is no gold standard to diagnose latent tuberculosis infection. The tuberculin skin test and interferon-gamma release assay are currently used to diagnose latent tuberculosis infection. However, studies have shown inconsistencies regarding the level of agreement between these tests in different settings. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the agreement between these two tests for diagnosing latent tuberculosis infection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. METHODS: We screened HIV patients with no clinical symptoms of tuberculosis, a normal chest X-ray, and no history of tuberculosis or use of antituberculous drugs. Participants were tested with tuberculin skin test (TST) and T-SPOT.TB (an interferon gamma release assay) simultaneously. Participants' HIV stage was determined by measuring the level of CD4+ T-lymphocytes. Tuberculosis status was confirmed by sputum examination using GeneXpert. The level of agreement between the TST and T-SPOT.TB results was measured using Cohen's kappa coefficient. RESULTS: Of the 112 participants, 20 had a positive T-SPOT.TB test result, and 21 had a positive TST result. The TST and T-SPOT.TB test results showed a high level of agreement (kappa = 0.648, P < 0.001). Performance of the tests did not vary with CD4+ level. However, in participants with CD4+ < 200 cells/mm(3), T-SPOT.TB detected more latent tuberculosis infections than the TST. CONCLUSION: There was good agreement between the TST and T-SPOT.TB results of latent tuberculosis infection in participants. TST is the preferred test for diagnosing latent tuberculosis infection in HIV-infected patients, especially in resource-limited settings, because it is simple and cost-effective. However, T-SPOT.TB may be useful to rule out latent tuberculosis infection in patients with severe immunodeficiency.","Reviono R, Saptawati L, Redhono D, Suryawati B",J Korean Med Sci,2019 Oct 21,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Histoplasma galactomannan (GM) ELISA was applied to sera of patients with unproven pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and patients with a positive Aspergillus GM. Both Histoplasma and Aspergillus GM tests were performed to determine any possible cross-reaction with certain foods. RESULTS: Fourteen of 122 (11.5%) sera of patients with newly diagnosed clinical TB were positive for Histoplasma GM. The positivity rate in the serum of patients 5-6 and 12 months after TB diagnosis was 3.8% and 3.5%, respectively. Of 88 positive Aspergillus GM sera, 63 (71.6%) were also positive for Histoplasma GM. All tested foods were positive for Aspergillus GM, while 65% of foods were positive for Histoplasma GM. CONCLUSION: Galactomannan is widespread in sera and food in Jakarta, possibly related to food consumption. Histoplasma and Aspergillus antigen detection for the diagnosis will require additional means of confirming the diagnosis; negative tests may be more helpful for ruling out invasive histoplasmosis and aspergillosis.","Wijaya M, Surja SS, Adawiyah R, Hariadi A, Setianingrum F, Rozaliyani A, Burhan E, Tugiran M, Sjam R, Denning DW, Wahyuningsih R",Mycoses,2024 Jan,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
33609618,The effect of a structured clinical algorithm on glycemic control in patients with combined tuberculosis and diabetes in Indonesia: A randomized trial.,"AIMS: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with worse tuberculosis (TB) treatment outcomes, especially among those with poor glycemic control. We examined whether a structured clinical algorithm could improve glycemic control in TB patients with DM. METHODS: In an open label randomized trial, TB-DM patients were randomized to scheduled counselling, glucose monitoring, and adjustment of medication using a structured clinical algorithm (intervention arm) or routine DM management (control arm), with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at month 6 as the primary end point. RESULTS: We randomized 150 pulmonary TB-DM patients (92% culture positive, 51.3% male, mean age 53 years). Baseline mean HbA1c was 11.0% in the intervention arm (n = 76) and 11.6% in the control arm (n = 74). At 6 months, HbA1c had decreased more in the intervention arm compared with the control arm (a difference of 1.82% HbA1c, 95% CI 0.82-2.83, p < 0.001). Five patients were hospitalized in the intervention arm and seven in the control arm. There was more hypoglycemia (35.0% vs 11.8%; p = 0.002) in the intervention arm. Two deaths occurred in the intervention arm, one due to cardiorespiratory failure and one because of suspected septic shock and multiorgan failure. CONCLUSION: Regular monitoring and algorithmic adjustment of DM treatment led to improved glycemic control.","Ruslami R, Koesoemadinata RC, Soetedjo NNM, Imaculata S, Gunawan Y, Permana H, Santoso P, Alisjahbana B, McAllister SM, Grint D, Critchley JA, Hill PC, van Crevel R",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,2021 Mar,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
30940123,"Sensitivity and specificity of routine diagnostic work-up for tuberculosis in lung clinics in Yogyakarta, Indonesia: a cohort study.","BACKGROUND: Establishing a correct diagnosis is challenging. We aimed to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of routine tuberculosis (TB) diagnostic work-up in lung clinics in Indonesia, a country with the third highest TB burden and the second highest gap between notifications of TB cases and the best estimate of incident cases in the world. METHODS: In the lung clinics of the Province of Yogyakarta, Indonesia, we recruited all consecutive patients with symptoms suggesting TB, aged >/=18 years. Routine TB examination consisted of clinical evaluation, sputum smear microscopy, and chest radiography. For research purposes, we added sputum culture, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) testing, and follow-up for 1.5 years or 2.5 years if culture results disagreed with the initial clinical diagnosis. The initial diagnosis was considered incorrect if patients did not respond to treatment. We calculated sensitivity and specificity of the TB routine examination using culture and a composite reference standard (CRS - a combination of routine examination, culture, and follow-up) as the reference standards. All analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS Statistics 25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). RESULTS: Between 2013 and 2015, we included 360 participants, and 21 were excluded due to incomplete data. Among those analyzed, 115 were initially diagnosed with smear-positive TB, 12 with smear-negative TB, and 212 non-TB. In 15 study participants, the diagnosis was changed after median 45 (range: 14-870) days; 14 participants initially not diagnosed with TB were later diagnosed with TB, while one subject initially diagnosed with TB actually did not have TB. Compared with culture and CRS, TB routine examination had sensitivity of 85% (95%CI: 77-91) and 90% (95%CI: 84-94), and specificity of 86.3% (95%CI: 81-91) and 99.5% (95%CI: 97-100), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of clinical evaluation with sputum microscopy and chest radiography provided high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing TB in lung clinics; in only 4.4% the diagnosis was incorrect. There is a need to improve routine TB diagnostic work by using clinical evaluation, sputum smear microscopy, and chest radiography all together in other settings, such as in primary health centers.

We hypothesize that COVID-19 occurrence had a delayed effect on tuberculosis case reports from the Indonesia Ministry of Health, also known as the tuberculosis case notification. The objectives of this study are: (1) to describe the potential effect of the reported COVID-19 cases on the spatial distribution of tuberculosis in four provinces of Sumatra Islands (Aceh, North Sumatra, West Sumatra, and Riau Provinces), Indonesia; (2) to estimate the temporal lag effect of the occurrence of COVID-19 on tuberculosis case notifications. METHODS: We retrieved data from the Indonesian Ministry of Health and the Indonesia COVID-19 Task Force. We also examined the monthly tuberculosis and COVID-19 case notifications. We identified time series clusters of tuberculosis case notifications and used lag non-linear model to assess the delayed effect of the occurrence of COVID-19 cases on tuberculosis case notifications. RESULTS: The secondary data included 217,593 tuberculosis case notifications (January 2019 to December 2022) and 373,671 reported COVID-19 cases (January 2020 to December 2022). Time series cluster analysis revealed 5 clusters each for monthly tuberculosis case notifications and monthly reported COVID-19 cases. There was a negative association with a 0-month lag in more than 10,000 reported COVID-19 cases (RR = 0.95, 95%CI: 0.91-0.98). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggested that Indonesia's national tuberculosis program in four provinces of Sumatra Island was disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lag analysis showed that COVID-19 case occurrence had an immediate effect on tuberculosis case notifications.

36425542,"Perinatal tuberculosis: a diagnostic and treatment challenge in a remote area of Asmat Regency of South Papua, Indonesia (case report).","Perinatal tuberculosis (TB) is a rare infectious disease. The diagnosis of perinatal TB is challenging due to its nonspecific clinical manifestations make it difficult to differentiate from other infections, resulting in a high mortality rate of 40-60%. Here we report a 26-day-old neonate with fever, cough, fast breathing, poor feeding, subcostal retraction, bilateral crackles, hepatomegaly, and signs of shock. Clinically, septic shock and pneumonia were suspected. Respiratory distress worsened despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, and kept getting worse up to the point that intubation and assisted mechanical ventilation were needed. The examination of acid-fast bacteria (AFB) stain on the endotracheal aspirate showed a positive result. The patient was diagnosed as having perinatal TB, then treated with anti-TB regimens (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol), as well as prednisone and other supportive medical care. Recurrent septic shock, laryngeal edema, and a possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) worsened the patient's condition. The patient eventually passed away on the 71(st) day of care. In conclusion, perinatal TB should be suspected in any neonates with fever, respiratory distress, and hepatosplenomegaly, particularly in those from endemic areas, which fail to respond to broad-spectrum antibiotics. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to improve the prognosis of perinatal TB.","Raymond S, Subekti HM, Sitompul ARH",Pan Afr Med J,2022,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
39111942,Experience and number of patients as associated factors toward clinical confidence among nursing students in caring for tuberculosis patients in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Nurses and nursing students are at greater risk of tuberculosis (TB) exposure due to their higher intensity contact with patients. In Indonesia, a country with high TB incidence, it is crucial to assess undergraduate nursing students' clinical confidence during their clinical practicums. PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore factors associated with nursing students' clinical confidence in caring for TB patients. METHODS: This cross-sectional study utilized an internet survey based on the United States National TB Curriculum Consortium (NTCC) in September and November 2020. The survey questions focused on TB knowledge, beliefs about the value of TB instruction, and clinical confidence in caring for TB patients. Descriptive statistics, t-test, ANOVA, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and hierarchical regression were used for data analysis. The Indonesian version of the original NTCC survey was used. RESULTS: The study found that nursing students' knowledge about TB increased with their year of study (r = 0.290, p < .001). However, students perceived TB instruction as less valuable as they neared graduation (r = -0.233, p < .001) and with more frequent practice in the TB unit (r = -0.162, p < .001). Students who spent more time learning about TB outside of class perceived the TB instruction in the nursing curriculum more positively (r = 0.181, p < .004). The study also found a significant difference between nursing students' belief in the value of TB education and their clinical confidence in caring for TB patients (F = 5.711, p < .001). Furthermore, experience caring for TB patients and the number of TB patients cared for predicted clinical confidence. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: This study highlights the need for improved curriculum content and teaching methods regarding TB for nursing students. It also suggests that experience caring for TB patients and the number of TB patients cared for can improve clinical confidence in nursing students. Given the high incidence of TB in Indonesia, this study's findings could have important implications for the country's healthcare system.","Theresia, Huang HM, Liu CY, Lee TY",Indian J Tuberc,2024 Jul,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
29325589,Catastrophic total costs in tuberculosis-affected households and their determinants since Indonesia's implementation of universal health coverage.,"BACKGROUND: As well as imposing an economic burden on affected households, the high costs related to tuberculosis (TB) can create access and adherence barriers. This highlights the particular urgency of achieving one of the End TB Strategy's targets: that no TB-affected households have to face catastrophic costs by 2020. In Indonesia, as elsewhere, there is also an emerging need to provide social protection by implementing universal health coverage (UHC). We therefore assessed the incidence of catastrophic total costs due to TB, and their determinants since the implementation of UHC. METHODS: We interviewed adult TB and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) patients in urban, suburban and rural areas of Indonesia who had been treated for at least one month or had finished treatment no more than one month earlier. Following the WHO recommendation, we assessed the incidence of catastrophic total costs due to TB. We also analyzed the sensitivity of incidence relative to several thresholds, and measured differences between poor and non-poor households in the incidence of catastrophic costs. Generalized linear mixed-model analysis was used to identify determinants of the catastrophic total costs. RESULTS: We analyzed 282 TB and 64 MDR-TB patients. For TB-related services, the median (interquartile range) of total costs incurred by households was 133 USD (55-576); for MDR-TB-related services, it was 2804 USD (1008-4325). The incidence of catastrophic total costs in all TB-affected households was 36% (43% in poor households and 25% in non-poor households). For MDR-TB-affected households, the incidence was 83% (83% and 83%). In TB-affected households, the determinants of catastrophic total costs were poor households (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.7, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7-7.8); being a breadwinner (aOR = 2.9, 95% CI: 1.3-6.6); job loss (aOR = 21.2; 95% CI: 8.3-53.9); and previous TB treatment (aOR = 2.9; 95% CI: 1.4-6.1). In MDR-TB-affected households, having an income-earning job before diagnosis was the only determinant of catastrophic total costs (aOR = 8.7; 95% CI: 1.8-41.7). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the implementation of UHC, TB-affected households still risk catastrophic total costs and further impoverishment. As well as ensuring access to healthcare, a cost-mitigation policy and additional financial protection should be provided to protect the poor and relieve income losses.","Fuady A, Houweling TAJ, Mansyur M, Richardus JH",Infect Dis Poverty,2018 Jan 12,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
33612763,"Laboratory findings and clinical characteristics of Pneumocystis pneumonia and tuberculosis infection among HIV-infected patients with pulmonary infiltrates in Jakarta, Indonesia.","Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and pulmonary tuberculosis infection (PTB) are important opportunistic infections in HIV-infected patients. The diagnosis remains challenging since Pneumocystis jirovecii cannot be cultured, and expectorated-sputum is frequently difficult to obtain. The monoclonal-antibody detection for P. jirovecii from induced sputum is promising in diagnosing PCP. This study determined the percentage of PCP in HIV-infected patients with pulmonary infiltrates at three government hospitals in Jakarta. The concurrent infection of PTB was carefully documented as well. This cross-sectional study was carried out by documenting the clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, chest X-ray, while clinical outcomes were evaluated during hospitalization. The sputum induction was conducted for P. jirovecii with monoclonal antibody detection at the laboratory of Parasitology Department, Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia, as well as Ziehl-Nielsen staining for PTB. The results indicated that of 55 HIV-infected patients with pulmonary infiltrates, the positive monoclonal antibody for P. jirovecii was detected in eight patients (14.6%). Weight loss, fever, shortness of breath, and crackles were found in all PCP patients; while dry cough in five patients. Moreover, PTB cases with positive acid-fast bacilli (AFB) was detected in five patients (9.1%), the PTB cases with negative AFB was 43.6% (24 out of 55 patients), and the rest 26 patients (47.3%) were not proven to have PTB. The concurrent infections of PCP and PTB were documented in three out of five positive AFB patients. The clinical outcome of eight PCP patients showed improvement in five patients, but the other three patients died. Laboratory findings play an important role in the diagnosis of PCP and PTB, along with clinical characteristics and radiological features. Low CD4(+) cell count was considered a possible risk factor for PCP and poor clinical outcomes.","Rozaliyani A, Wiyono WH, Nawas MA, Sijam R, Adawiyah R, Tugiran M, Wahyuningsih R",Trop Biomed,2020 Dec 1,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
28317798,"Nontuberculous mycobacterial species and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex coinfection in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis in Dr. Soetomo Hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia.","OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to analyze the detection of nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) species derived from sputum specimens of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) suspects. Increasing prevalence and incidence of pulmonary infection by NTM species have widely been reported in several countries with geographical variation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2014 and September 2015, sputum specimens from chronic pulmonary TB suspect patients were analyzed. Laboratory examination of mycobacteria was conducted in the TB laboratory, Department of Clinical Microbiology, Dr. Soetomo Hospital, Surabaya. Detection and identification of mycobacteria were performed by the standard culture method using the BACTEC MGIT 960 system (BD) and Lowenstein-Jensen medium. Identification of positive Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) was based on positive acid-fast bacilli microscopic smear, positive niacin accumulation, and positive TB Ag MPT 64 test results (SD Bioline). If the growth of positive cultures and acid-fast bacilli microscopic smear was positive, but niacin accumulation and TB Ag MPT 64 (SD Bioline) results were negative, then the isolates were categorized as NTM species. MTBC isolates were also tested for their sensitivity toward first-line anti-TB drugs, using isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and streptomycin. RESULTS: From 2440 sputum specimens of pulmonary TB suspect patients, 459 isolates (18.81%) were detected as MTBC and 141 (5.78%) as NTM species. CONCLUSION: From the analyzed sputum specimens, 18.81% were detected as MTBC and 5.78% as NTM species. Each pulmonary TB suspect patient needed clinical settings to suspect causative agents of MTBC and/or NTM species; clinicians have to understand the local epidemiological data for the evaluation of causes of lung infection to determine appropriate therapy.","Mertaniasih NM, Kusumaningrum D, Koendhori EB, Kusmiati T, Dewi DN",Int J Mycobacteriol,2017 Jan-Mar,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
26825253,"Predominance of modern Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains and active transmission of Beijing sublineage in Jayapura, Indonesia Papua.","Mycobacterium tuberculosis genotype distribution is different between West and Central Indonesia, but there are no data on the most Eastern part, Papua. We aimed to identify the predominant genotypes of M. tuberculosis responsible for tuberculosis in coastal Papua, their transmission, and the association with patient characteristics. A total of 199 M. tuberculosis isolates were collected. Spoligotyping was applied to describe the population structure of M. tuberculosis, lineage identification was performed using a combination of lineage-specific markers, and genotypic clusters were identified using a combination of 24-locus-MIRU-VNTR and spoligotyping. A high degree of genetic diversity was observed among isolates based on their spoligopatterns. Strains from modern lineage 4 made up almost half of strains (46.9%), being more abundant than the ancient lineage 1 (33.7%), and modern lineage 2 (19.4%). Thirty-five percent of strains belonged to genotypic clusters, especially strains in the Beijing genotype. Previous TB treatment and mutations associated with drug resistance were more common in patients infected with strains of the Beijing genotype. Papua shows a different distribution of M. tuberculosis genotypes compared to other parts of Indonesia. Clustering and drug resistance of modern strains recently introduced to Papua may contribute to the high tuberculosis burden in this region.","Chaidir L, Sengstake S, de Beer J, Oktavian A, Krismawati H, Muhapril E, Kusumadewi I, Annisa J, Anthony R, van Soolingen D, Achmad TH, Marzuki S, Alisjahbana B, van Crevel R",Infect Genet Evol,2016 Apr,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
21940084,"Life of a partnership: the process of collaboration between the National Tuberculosis Program and the hospitals in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.","Public-private partnerships (PPP) for improving the health of populations are currently attracting attention in many countries with limited resources. The Public-Private Mix for Tuberculosis Control is an example of an internationally supported PPP that aims to engage all providers, including hospitals, to implement standardized diagnosis and treatment. This paper explores mainly the local actors' views and experiences of the process of PPP in delivering TB care in hospitals in Yogyakarta Province, Indonesia. The study used a qualitative research design. By maximum variation sampling, 33 informants were purposefully selected. The informants were involved in the Public-Private Mix for Tuberculosis Control in Yogyakarta Province. Data were collected during 2008-2009 by in-depth interview and analyzed using content analysis techniques. Triangulation, reference group checking and peer debriefing were conducted to improve the trustworthiness of the data. This analysis showed that the process of partnership was dynamic. In the early phase of partnership, the National Tuberculosis Program and hospital actors perceived barriers to interaction such as low enthusiasm, lack of confidence, mistrust and inequality of relationships. The existence of an intermediary actor was important for approaching the National Tuberculosis Program and hospitals. After intensive interactions, compromises and acceptance were reached among the actors and even enabled the growth of mutual respect and feelings of programme ownership. However, the partnership faced declining interactions when faced with scarce resources and weak governance. The strategies, power and interactions between actors are important aspects of the process of collaboration. We conclude that good partnership governance is needed for the partnership to be effective and sustainable.","Probandari A, Utarini A, Lindholm L, Hurtig AK",Soc Sci Med,2011 Nov,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
32799940,Investigating the risk factors for contraction and diagnosis of human tuberculosis in Indonesia using data from the fifth wave of RAND's Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS-5).,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a globally widespread disease, with approximately a quarter of the world's population currently infected (WHO, 2018). Some risk factors, such as HIV status, nutrition and body mass index, have already been thoroughly investigated. However, little attention has been given to behavioural and/or psychological risk factors such as stress and education level. This study investigated the risk factors for TB diagnosis by statistical analyses of publicly available data from the most recent wave of the Indonesian Family Life survey (IFLS-5) conducted in 2015. Out of 34,249 respondents there were 328 who reported having TB. For comparison and completeness, variables were divided into levels: individual-, household- and community-level variables. The most prominent and interesting variables found to influence TB diagnosis status (on each level) were investigated, and a logistic regression was subsequently developed to understand the extent to which each risk factor acts as a predictor for being diagnosed with TB. Age, health benefit or insurance, stress at work and living in a rural area all showed significant association with TB diagnosis status. This study's findings suggest that suitable control measures, such as schemes for improving mental health/stress reduction and improved access to health care in rural areas should be implemented in Indonesia to address each of the key factors identified.","Adam N, Pallikadavath S, Cerasuolo M, Amos M",J Biosoc Sci,2021 Jul,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
39176259,"The association between climate variables and tuberculosis in Kolaka District, Southeast Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, 2013-2020: a Bayesian autoregressive model.","BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis is one of the diseases that requires comprehensive treatment. This disease is highly contagious and can be transmitted through the air. Climate factors play a role in the increasing cases of tuberculosis. This study aimed to determine the correlation between climatic variables and TB in Kolaka District, Southeast Sulawesi Province, Indonesia. METHODS: This research was modeled using an autoregressive (AR) Bayesian model with three possible likelihoods; Gaussian, Poisson and Negative Binomial responses. RESULTS: Minimum temperature and average temperature, a coefficient of 4.234 suggests that for every 1 degree increase in minimum temperature, there is an estimated increase of approximately four cases, assuming other variables remain constant. Maximum temperature, a coefficient of 17.851 suggests that for every 1 degree increase in maximum temperature, there is an estimated increase of around 17-18 cases, assuming other variables remain constant. Humidity, a coefficient of -13.413 suggests that for every 1% increase in humidity, there is an estimated decrease of around 13 cases, assuming other variables remain constant. Rainfall, a coefficient of -0.327 suggests that for every 1 mm increase in rainfall, there is an estimated decrease of around 0.327 cases, assuming other variables remain constant. Light, a coefficient of -4.322 suggests that for every 1-hour increase in light duration, there is an estimated decrease of around four cases, assuming other variables remain constant. CONCLUSIONS: Climate change has a significant impact on tuberculosis through temperature-related factors. These factors influence the prevalence, spread, and vulnerability to TB. Addressing these challenges requires a holistic approach involving adaptation planning. Strong public health systems and healthcare infrastructure can help mitigate the risks and impacts of climate change-related tuberculosis.","Tosepu R, Sani A, Effendy DS, Ahmad OAI",F1000Res,2023,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
25704441,Risk of infection and disease with Mycobacterium tuberculosis among children identified through prospective community-based contact screening in Indonesia.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify characteristics of the child contact, index case or environment that are associated with infection or tuberculosis in child contacts in an urban community in Indonesia. METHOD: Children who were close contacts of an index case with pulmonary tuberculosis were screened for infection and disease in Yogyakarta, Indonesia from August 2010 to December 2012. Data of the index case and child were collected prospectively, and all child contacts had clinical assessment, tuberculin skin test (TST) and chest X-ray performed. Those with clinically suspected tuberculosis also had sputum examined by Xpert MTB/RIF and culture. Child contacts were managed according to national guidelines, followed for 12 months and had a final classification of either tuberculosis 'disease', latent tuberculous infection (LTBI) or 'exposed only'. RESULTS: About 269 children of 141 index cases were investigated. Final classification was tuberculosis in 25 (9%) and LTBI in 121 (45%). The risk of infection was significantly greater if the source case was female (AOR 1.7; 95% CI: 1.0-2.8), had sputum smear-positive tuberculosis (AOR 3.0; 95% CI 1.5-6.0) or slept in the same room (AOR 1.7, 95% CI 1.0-2.9). A positive TST was independently associated with a diagnosis of tuberculosis (AOR 7.3; 95% CI 2.4-22). CONCLUSION: This study highlights the high risk and the risk factors associated with tuberculosis and LTBI among child contacts in Indonesia.","Triasih R, Robertson C, Duke T, Graham SM",Trop Med Int Health,2015 Jun,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
22333111,"Diagnostic work-up and loss of tuberculosis suspects in Jogjakarta, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: Early and accurate diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is critical for successful TB control. To assist in the diagnosis of smear-negative pulmonary TB, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends the use of a diagnostic algorithm. Our study evaluated the implementation of the national tuberculosis programme's diagnostic algorithm in routine health care settings in Jogjakarta, Indonesia. The diagnostic algorithm is based on the WHO TB diagnostic algorithm, which had already been implemented in the health facilities. METHODS: We prospectively documented the diagnostic work-up of all new tuberculosis suspects until a diagnosis was reached. We used clinical audit forms to record each step chronologically. Data on the patient's gender, age, symptoms, examinations (types, dates, and results), and final diagnosis were collected. RESULTS: Information was recorded for 754 TB suspects; 43.5% of whom were lost during the diagnostic work-up in health centres, 0% in lung clinics. Among the TB suspects who completed diagnostic work-ups, 51.1% and 100.0% were diagnosed without following the national TB diagnostic algorithm in health centres and lung clinics, respectively. However, the work-up in the health centres and lung clinics generally conformed to international standards for tuberculosis care (ISTC). Diagnostic delays were significantly longer in health centres compared to lung clinics. CONCLUSIONS: The high rate of patients lost in health centres needs to be addressed through the implementation of TB suspect tracing and better programme supervision. The national TB algorithm needs to be revised and differentiated according to the level of care.","Ahmad RA, Matthys F, Dwihardiani B, Rintiswati N, de Vlas SJ, Mahendradhata Y, van der Stuyft P",BMC Public Health,2012 Feb 15,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
40049398,Emerging evidence to reduce the burden of tuberculosis in children and young people.,"Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health challenge. Children, adolescents, and young mothers are high-risk populations for TB with unique challenges and needs. Children are often misdiagnosed or diagnosed too late, resulting in long-term sequelae or mortality, while adolescents, despite having more recognizable adult-type TB and being an important source of community transmission, can be difficult to engage in care as they often fall between pediatric and adult models of care. TB during pregnancy poses significant risks to the mother-infant pair, yet antenatal screening to ensure timely treatment initiation is often inadequate. Recent research advancements to address these challenges include more accessible TB management aids, shorter effective drug regimens, child-friendly drug formulations, strategies for active case finding to expand treatment coverage including of asymptomatic disease, and more options for preventive therapy. These advances have informed global policy and guidelines; however, major gaps in translation from policy to practice remain. This narrative review discusses the progress and identifies potential solutions with insights from the Asia-Pacific region to ongoing challenges in TB detection, treatment, and prevention in children and young people, with a view to TB elimination.","Huynh J, Abo YN, Triasih R, Singh V, Pukai G, Masta P, Tsogt B, Luu BK, Felisia F, Pank N, Aung A, Morton A, Azzopardi P, Koesoemadinata RC, Alisjahbana B, Hill PC, Marais BJ, Chiang SS, Graham SM",Int J Infect Dis,2025 Jun,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
33118039,"Screening diabetes mellitus patients for pulmonary tuberculosis: a multisite study in Indonesia, Peru, Romania and South Africa.","BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) patients are three times more likely to develop tuberculosis (TB) than the general population. Active TB screening in people with DM is part of a bidirectional approach. The aim of this study was to conduct pragmatic active TB screening among DM patients in four countries to inform policy. METHODS: DM patients were recruited in Indonesia (n=809), Peru (n=600), Romania (n=603) and South Africa (n=51). TB cases were diagnosed using an algorithm including clinical symptoms and chest X-ray. Presumptive TB patients were examined with sputum smear and culture. RESULTS: A total of 171 (8.3%) individuals reported ever having had TB (South Africa, 26%; Indonesia, 12%; Peru, 7%; Romania, 4%), 15 of whom were already on TB treatment. Overall, 14 (0.73% [95% confidence interval 0.40 to 1.23]) TB cases were identified from screening. Poor glucose control, smoking, lower body mass index, education and socio-economic status were associated with newly diagnosed/current TB. Thirteen of the 14 TB cases diagnosed from this screening would have been found using a symptom-based approach. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the World Health Organization recommendation for routine symptom-based screening for TB in known DM patients in high TB-burden countries.

39837582,"Health and tuberculosis systems resilience, the role of the private sector and pandemic preparedness: insights from a cross-country qualitative study with policy-makers in India, Indonesia and Nigeria.","INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic was an unprecedented challenge to health systems worldwide and had a severe impact on tuberculosis (TB) case notifications and service delivery. India, Indonesia and Nigeria are high TB-burden countries where the majority of initial care-seeking happens in the private health sector. The objectives of this study were to (1) explore policy-makers' perspectives on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on private sector TB service delivery in India, Indonesia and Nigeria and (2) identify cross-cutting insights for pandemic preparedness with respect to TB service delivery. METHODS: From May to November 2021, 33 interviews were conducted with key policy-makers involved in health service administration, TB service delivery and/or the COVID-19 response in India, Indonesia and Nigeria (n=11 in each country). Interviews focused on the impact of COVID-19 on TB services and lessons learnt for pandemic preparedness with respect to TB in each study context. Data were analysed thematically using a hybrid inductive-deductive approach, informed by Haldane et al's Determinants of Health Systems Resilience Framework. RESULTS: Policy-makers highlighted the crucial role of intersectoral collaboration, effective governance, innovative financing strategies, health workforce reallocation and technological advancements such as virtual consultations and mHealth in strengthening TB service delivery amid the COVID-19 pandemic. India relied on patient-provider support agencies to implement a joint strategy for TB care across sectors and states. Indonesia engaged networks of private provider professional associations to facilitate coordination of the COVID-19 response. Nigeria implemented a pandemic policy for public-private referral for the continuity of TB care. CONCLUSIONS: Countries implemented varied measures to support TB service delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study presents insights from three countries (India, Indonesia and Nigeria) that together offer a 'menu' of possibilities for supporting pandemic preparedness with respect to TB care vis-a-vis strengthening health systems resilience.","Brubacher LJ, Yellappa V, Lestari BW, Heitkamp P, Aguilera Vasquez N, Sassi A, Olusola-Faleye B, Thapa P, Shyam Klinton J, Sheokand S, Pai M, Oga-Omenka C",BMJ Glob Health,2025 Jan 20,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
38771281,Tuberculosis Coinfection among COVID-19 Patients: Clinical Presentation and Mortality in a Tertiary Lung Hospital in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are the top two killers of infectious disease. We aimed to determine the association of TB coinfection with the inhospital mortality of COVID-19 patients in Indonesia as a TB-endemic country. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in a tertiary lung hospital in Indonesia. All TB-coinfected COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized between January 2020 and December 2021 were included in the study. COVID-19 patients without TB were randomly selected for the control group. Clinical characteristics and laboratory results were assessed. Survival analysis was performed to determine the estimated death rate and median survival time (MST). Multivariate Cox regression analysis was conducted to define the association of TB coinfection with the in-hospital mortality of COVID-19. RESULTS: We included 86 (8.3%) TB coinfections among 1034 confirmed COVID-19 patients. TB coinfection patients had younger age, malnutrition, and different symptoms compared to the COVID-19 group. TB-coinfected patients had a lower estimated death rate than the COVID-19 group (6.5 vs. 18.8 per 1000 population). MST in the COVID-19 group was 38 (interquartile range 16-47) days, whereas the same observation time failed to determine the MST in the TB coinfection group. TB coinfection had a crude hazard ratio of mortality 0.37 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.15-0.94, P = 0. 004). The final model analysis including age, sex, and lymphocyte as confounding factors resulted in an adjusted HR of mortality 0.31 (95% CI 0.1-0.9). CONCLUSION: This study showed TB coinfection was negatively associated with the in-hospital mortality of COVID-19.","Muflihah H, Yulianto FA, Rina, Sampurno E, Ferdiana A, Rahimah SB",Int J Mycobacteriol,2024 Jan 1,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
39278670,"Detection of katG, inhA and ahpC gene mutation in clinical isolates of isoniazid-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Makassar City, South Sulawesi, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is an airborne disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). The world is currently facing challenges due to the spread of anti-tuberculosis drug-resistant of M. tuberculosis. Isoniazid-resistant (INH), is one of the first-line anti-tuberculosis agents that has a high resistance case. This study used Multiplex allele-specific Polymerase Chain Reaction (MAS-PCR) to detect the most common mutations associated with isoniazid resistance on inhA, katG, and ahpC gene. METHODS: This study used samples from clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis which had been tested for their antibiotic sensitivity of first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. The DNA extraction process was carried out using the boiling method and then amplified with specific primers for inhA, katG, and ahpC genes using the MAS-PCR method. The results are then read on the electrophoretic gel with an interpretation of the mutation gene when the target gene DNA bands were absent according to the allele-specific fragments target. RESULTS: A total of 200 isolates were tested in this study consisting of isoniazid-resistant and susceptible with the largest distribution of Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR) isolates with a total of 146 isolates (73%). The most significant gene mutation was on the ahpC gene in 61 isolates (30,5%) and the combination mutation of the katG + ahpC gene in 52 isolates (26%) with sensitivity and specificity of the test reaching 87% and 42% for the detection of INH-resistant. CONCLUSION: Mutation on the ahpC gene has the highest percentage in this study. AhpC gene can be considered one of the essential genes to be tested for the cause of isoniazid-resistant. Using MAS-PCR for detecting gene mutation in isoniazid-resistant was simple and easy, it has the potential to be widely used as a rapid screening molecular test.","Junaedi MA, Massi MN, Sjahril R, Halik H, Muttaqin Z, Rifqiani N, Safitri NI, Pratika M, Islam IC, Hamid F, Natzir R, Ahmad A",Indian J Tuberc,2024 Oct,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
39319395,Chest X-Ray Comparison Between Drug-Resistant and Drug-Sensitive Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Children.,"INTRODUCTION: Chest X-ray (CXR) remains one of the tools used in diagnosing tuberculosis (TB). However, few studies about such tools exist, specifically in children in Indonesia. We aim to investigate and compare the CXR findings of children with pulmonary drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) and drug-sensitive TB (DS-TB) that could help in the evaluation and management of TB cases in children. METHODS: Retrospective analysis with cross-sectional approach was conducted in children (<18 years old) diagnosed with pulmonary DR-TB and DS-TB from January 2018 to December 2021. Documented data were collected from the Paediatric Respirology Registry and Tuberculosis Information System at Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital Bandung. Characteristics of children, CXR findings, and TB severity were assessed and compared using the chi-square and Fisher's exact tests with significance levels set at p value <0.05. RESULTS: Sixty-nine children (DR-TB 31 children vs. DS-TB 38 children) were assessed. Of the 31 children with DR-TB, 65% were classified as multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), followed by rifampicin-resistant TB (RR-TB), pre-extensively drug-resistant TB (pre-XDR-TB), and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB). The most common CXR findings in DR-TB are consolidation (68%), fibrosis (42%), and cavity (29%), whereas in DS-TB, it is pleura effusion (37%). Severe TB accounts for 50% of DR-TB (p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Consolidation, fibrosis, cavities, and findings of severe TB are most common in DR-TB. Pleural effusion is the most common in DS-TB. These findings have the potential to be considered in further examination of children with pulmonary DR-TB and DS-TB; hence, more extensive studies are needed to confirm these results.","Zuhriyyah SA, Nugraha HG, Setiabudi D, Santoso P, Nataprawira HM",Clin Respir J,2024 Sep,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
27503095,"Improving knowledge and behaviours related to the cause, transmission and prevention of Tuberculosis and early case detection: a descriptive study of community led Tuberculosis program in Flores, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: The community's awareness of Tuberculosis (TB) and delays in health care seeking remain important issues in Indonesia despite the extensive efforts of community-based TB programs delivered by a non-government organisation (NGO). This study explored the knowledge and behaviours in relation to TB and early diagnosis before and after an asset-based intervention designed to improve these issues. METHODS: Six villages in Flores, Indonesia were purposively selected to participate in this study. Three villages served as intervention villages and the other three villages provided a comparison group. Data collection included interviews, group discussions, observations, field notes and audit of records. RESULTS: In total, 50 participants across six villages were interviewed and three group discussions were conducted in the intervention villages supplemented by 1 - 5 h of observation during monthly visits. Overall, participants in all villages had limited knowledge regarding the cause and transmission of TB before the intervention. The delay in health seeking behaviour was mainly influenced by ignorance of TB symptoms. Health care providers also contributed to delayed diagnosis by ignoring the symptoms of TB suspects at the first visit and failing to examine TB suspects with sputum tests. Stigmatisation of TB patients by the community was reported, although this did not seem to be common. Early case detection was less than 50 % in four of the six villages before the asset-based intervention. Knowledge of TB improved after the intervention in the intervention villages alongside improved education activities. Early case detection also increased in the intervention villages following this intervention. The behaviour changes related to prevention of TB were also obvious in the intervention villages but not the comparison group. CONCLUSION: This small project demonstrated that an asset-based intervention can result in positive changes in community's knowledge and behaviour in relation to TB and early case detection. A continuing education process is like to be required to maintain this outcome and to reach a wider community. Promoting community involvement and local initiatives and engaging health care providers were important elements in the community-based TB program implemented.","Dewi C, Barclay L, Passey M, Wilson S",BMC Public Health,2016 Aug 8,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
30832666,"Being safe, feeling safe, and stigmatizing attitude among primary health care staff in providing multidrug-resistant tuberculosis care in Bantul District, Yogyakarta Province, Indonesia.","INTRODUCTION: Patient-centered care approach in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis care requires health worker safety that covers both being safe and feeling safe to conduct the services. Stigma has been argued as a barrier to patient-centered care. However, there has been relatively little research addressing the issues of safety and stigma among health staff. This paper explored the issue of being safe, feeling safe, and stigmatizing attitude among health staff working with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis cases in primary health care facilities in Indonesia. METHODS: Using a mixed methods research design, data was collected with structured questionnaires among 123 staff, observations of infection control in 17 primary health care facilities, and in-depth interviews among 22 staff. RESULTS: The findings showed suboptimal infection control infrastructures for the primary health care facilities. The knowledge and motivation to follow multidrug-resistant tuberculosis care protocols are suboptimal. Feeling unsafe is related to stigmatizing attitude in providing multidrug-resistant tuberculosis care. CONCLUSION: Being safe, feeling unsafe, and stigmatizing attitude are challenges in providing patient-centered multidrug-resistant tuberculosis care in primary health care facilities in Indonesia. Serious efforts are needed on all levels to ensure safety and prevent irrational stigma.","Probandari A, Sanjoto H, Mahanani MR, Azizatunnisa L, Widayati S",Hum Resour Health,2019 Mar 4,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia

This study aimed to engage with multisectoral stakeholders in Indonesia to co-develop a peer-led, community-based psychosocial intervention that is replicable, acceptable, and sustainable. We used a participatory action design and engaged key national, multisectoral stakeholders to ensure that the intervention co-design was relevant and appropriate to the TB health system and the sociocultural context of Indonesia. The co-design of the intervention evolved through four phases: (1) a scoping review to identify a long list of potential TB stigma reduction interventions; (2) a modified Delphi survey to define a shortlist of the potential interventions; (3) a national multisectoral participatory workshop to identify and pre-finalize the most viable elements of psychosocial support to distill into a single multi-faceted intervention; and (4) finalization of the intervention activities. The scoping review identified 12 potential intervention activities. These were then reduced to a shortlist of six potential intervention activities through a modified Delphi Survey completed by 22 multisectoral stakeholder representatives. At the national participatory workshop, the suitability, acceptability, and feasibility of the six potential intervention activities were discussed by the key stakeholders, and consensus reached on the final four activities to be integrated into the psychosocial support intervention. These activities consisted of: individual psychological assessment and counselling; monthly peer-led group counselling; peer-led individual support; and community-based TB Talks. In Indonesia, meaningful participation of multisectoral stakeholders facilitated co-design of a community-based, peer-led intervention to reduce TB stigma and depression amongst people with TB and their households. The intervention was considered to be locally appropriate and viable, and is being implemented and evaluated as part of the TB-CAPS intervention study.","Fuady A, Anindhita M, Hanifah M, Putri AMN, Karnasih A, Agiananda F, Yani FF, Haya MAN, Pakasi TA, Wingfield T",NPJ Prim Care Respir Med,2025 Jan 27,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia

These radiological features and clinical manifestations are often found to show atypical features in subjects coinfected with Tuberculosis- Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), making TB diagnosis and early management challenging to establish. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the clinical and radiological presentation of pulmonary TB patients with HIV coinfection at the Central General Hospital Sanglah, Bali. METHODS: This research was an observational analytic study with a cross-sectional method. A total of 54 TB-HIV coinfected patients were analyzed to their sociodemographic characteristics, clinical manifestations and chest radiographic features. RESULTS: The majority of subjects were of productive age (26-61 years), male (64.8%) and belonged to the heterosexual group (90.7%). Weight loss (75.9%), cough (64.8%) and oral candidiasis (53.7%) are the most common clinical manifestations found in subjects, especially in subjects with CD4+ >200 cells/mm3. Atypical radiological features such as infiltration/consolidation (59.3%), fibrosis (16.7%) and hillar lymphadenopathy (14.8%) are the most commonly obtained radiological features of the subjects. From the results of the bivariate analysis, it was found that radiological features in the form of infiltration/consolidation were more commonly found in subjects with CD4+ <200 cells/mm3 (OR=1.254; 95% CI 1.059-1.568).

OBJECTIVE: To understand the economic burden of TB in Indonesia. DESIGN: TB data for 2015 were combined with cost data using a simple type of cost-benefit analysis in a decision tree model to show the economic burden under different scenarios. RESULTS: In Indonesia, there were an estimated 1 017 378 new active TB cases in 2015, including multidrug-resistant TB. It is estimated that 417 976 of these cases would be treated and cured, 160 830 would be unsuccessfully treated and would die, 131 571 would be untreated and would achieve cure spontaneously, and 307 000 would be untreated and would die. The total economic burden related to treated and untreated cases would be approximately US$6.9 billion. Loss of productivity due to premature death would be by far the largest element, comprising US$6.0 billion (discounted), which represents 86.6% of the total cost. Loss of productivity due to illness would be US$700 million (10.1%), provider medical costs US$156 million (2.2%), and direct non-medical costs incurred by patients and their households US$74 million (1.1%). CONCLUSION: The economic burden of TB in Indonesia is extremely high. Detecting and treating more cases would result not only in major reductions in suffering but also in economic savings to society.","Collins D, Hafidz F, Mustikawati D",Int J Tuberc Lung Dis,2017 Sep 1,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
39523820,Pregnant women and healthcare workers' perceptions on tuberculosis and screening: a cross-sectional study in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: There is a scarcity of studies regarding the obstacles in tuberculosis (TB) screening in pregnant women. This study aimed to assess the perceptions of TB as a disease and TB screening among pregnant women and healthcare workers, describe pregnant women's perceptions on specific TB screening methods and explore associations between the perceptions of TB with the intention to have TB screening by pregnant women. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at six primary healthcare centres in Yogyakarta Municipality, Indonesia among 240 pregnant women and 126 healthcare workers interviewed with a structured questionnaire about their perceptions. Perceptions were analysed as percentages and associated factors were tested by multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Most pregnant women and healthcare workers supported TB screening in pregnant women based on their perceptions of the susceptibility to or severity of TB and the benefits and risks of TB screening. Women who perceived the high susceptibility of TB disease and the benefits of TB screening were significantly more likely to have high intentions to accept TB screening in the future. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women's perceptions of TB and TB screening influenced their intention to be screened; however, appropriate testing methods for universal TB screening in pregnant women in areas with a high prevalence of TB require further studies.","Rahari DS, Nurdiati DS, Thobari JA, Suyanto S, Liabsuetrakul T",Int Health,2025 May 1,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
22118166,Tuberculosis mortality differentials in Indonesia during 2007-2008: evidence for health policy and monitoring.,"BACKGROUND: Indonesia bears the third highest tuberculosis (TB) burden in the world. Current mortality estimates are based on notification and case fatality rates derived from the National TB Control Programme. OBJECTIVE: To report TB mortality measures for 2007-2008 based on death registration systems in selected populations in five provinces of Indonesia. METHODS: Data were compiled from sites in Central Java, Lampung, Gorontalo, West Kalimantan and Papua in 2007-2008, covering 2.5 million people. Overall mortality levels and TB mortality indicators were computed. Data quality was assessed in terms of completeness of death registration and strength of evidence in verbal autopsy questionnaires. RESULTS: A total of 1547 TB deaths were diagnosed in the five provinces. There was direct or indirect evidence of incomplete death registration at all sites. More than 90% of TB diagnoses from verbal autopsies were based on strong evidence. The results demonstrate high TB death rates in Papua, and significant mortality differentials across provinces. CONCLUSIONS: The measurement of cause-specific mortality is feasible by strengthening death registration in Indonesia. Observed TB mortality rates from five sites are baseline evidence for monitoring TB control programmes. Sustained efforts are required to develop death registration as a routine annual source of mortality data for Indonesia.","Rao C, Kosen S, Bisara D, Usman Y, Adair T, Djaja S, Suhardi S, Soemantri S, Lopez AD",Int J Tuberc Lung Dis,2011 Dec,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
21605474,"The burden and treatment of HIV in tuberculosis patients in Papua Province, Indonesia: a prospective observational study.","BACKGROUND: New diagnoses of tuberculosis (TB) present important opportunities to detect and treat HIV. Rates of HIV and TB in Indonesia's easternmost Papua Province exceed national figures, but data on co-infection rates and outcomes are lacking. We aimed to measure TB-HIV co-infection rates, examine longitudinal trends, compare management with World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations, and document progress and outcome. METHODS: Adults with newly-diagnosed smear-positive pulmonary TB managed at the Timika TB clinic, Papua Province, were offered voluntary counselling and testing for HIV in accordance with Indonesian National Guidelines, using a point-of-care antibody test. Positive tests were confirmed with 2 further rapid tests. Study participants were assessed using clinical, bacteriological, functional and radiological measures and followed up for 6 months. RESULTS: Of 162 participants, HIV status was determined in 138 (85.2%), of whom 18 (13.0%) were HIV+. Indigenous Papuans were significantly more likely to be HIV+ than Non-Papuans (Odds Ratio [OR] 4.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.38-14.23). HIV prevalence among people with TB was significantly higher than during a 2003-4 survey at the same TB clinic, and substantially higher than the Indonesian national estimate of 3%. Compared with HIV- study participants, those with TB-HIV co-infection had significantly lower exercise tolerance (median difference in 6-minute walk test: 25 m, p = 0.04), haemoglobin (mean difference: 1.3 g/dL, p = 0.002), and likelihood of cavitary disease (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.12-1.01), and increased occurrence of pleural effusion (OR 3.60, 95% CI 1.70-7.58), higher rates of hospitalisation or death (OR 11.80, 95% CI 1.82-76.43), but no difference in the likelihood of successful 6-month treatment outcome. Adherence to WHO guidelines was limited by the absence of integration of TB and HIV services, specifically, with no on-site ART prescriber available. Only six people had CD4+ T-cell counts recorded, 11 were prescribed co-trimoxazole and 4 received ART before, during or after TB treatment, despite ART being indicated in 14 according to 2006 WHO guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: TB-HIV co-infection in southern Papua, Indonesia, is a serious emerging problem especially among the Indigenous population, and has risen rapidly in the last 5 years. Major efforts are required to incorporate new WHO recommendations on TB-HIV management into national guidelines, and support their implementation in community settings.","Pontororing GJ, Kenangalem E, Lolong DB, Waramori G, Sandjaja, Tjitra E, Price RN, Kelly PM, Anstey NM, Ralph AP",BMC Infect Dis,2010,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
40128976,"Influences of radiographic silicosis and drug supervisor on the development of multi drug resistant-tuberculosis in West Java, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: Indonesia is among countries with a high incidence of multi drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) globally. In this study, we aim to determine the prevalence of silico-tuberculosis among TB patients and to investigate the association of radiographic silicosis and the role of drug supervisor as well as other socio-clinical factors, in the development of MDR-TB in Indonesia. METHODS: A hospital-based study in West Java among 148 MDR-TB patients (case) and 164 drug-sensitive/DS-TB patients (control) was conducted. Chest x-rays were evaluated by two radiologists and one NIOSH B reader according to the ILO Classification. Face-to-face interviews were conducted using structured questionnaires to collect patients' information, including the task of drug supervisor. RESULTS: Findings indicate that supportive drug supervisor reduces the risk of developing MDR-TB, but silicosis showed no significant association. Nevertheless, in this study we found that 17 cases (5.4%) had silico-tuberculosis mostly exhibited as ILO profusion 3; predominated by q shape, 52.9% with large opacities and dominated by size A. Other factors significantly associated with the risk of developing MDR-TB were marital status, low income, longer traveling time to hospital, unsuccessful previous treatment and suffering drug side effects. CONCLUSION: This study reveals that one of preventive healthcare strategy to protect TB patients from developing MDR-TB is supportive drug supervisor. While, the development of MDR-TB was not significantly influenced by silicosis; however, there is a notable prevalence of silicosis as determined by chest radiography, highlighting the critical need for dust control, occupational hygiene, and health screening for high-risk populations.","Indriyati LH, Eitoku M, J-P NA, Nishimori M, Hamada N, Sawitri N, Suganuma N",Environ Health Prev Med,2025,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
2498217,Epidemiological model and cost-effectiveness analysis of tuberculosis treatment programmes in Indonesia.,"An epidemiological model of tuberculosis, based on the natural history of tuberculosis and the control programmes in Indonesia, was constructed. This model was used for estimating future tuberculosis-prevented cases and costs for three treatment strategies--the 100% standard course, the 100% short course, and the existing strategy (a combination of 65% standard course and 35% short course)--in accordance with the master plan of the Indonesian Government's tuberculosis control programme. A cost-effectiveness analysis of the three strategies confirmed that the short-course strategy was the most cost-effective. Sensitivity analysis, which applied a broad range of parameters, continued to confirm the short-course strategy as the most cost-effective. If the short-course strategy had been applied in 1980 instead of the existing strategy (using the most likely parameters), the short-course strategy would prevent 1.8 million sputum-positive cases and would save 61.0 million dollars by the year 2000.","Joesoef MR, Remington PL, Jiptoherijanto PT",Int J Epidemiol,1989 Mar,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
29202851,"Female genital tuberculosis and infertility: serial cases report in Bandung, Indonesia and literature review.","BACKGROUND: Female genital tuberculosis (FGTB) is a Mycobacterium infection in the reproductive organs which often leads to infertility. FGTB is either asymptomatic or causes uncharacteristic clinical presentations, making an early diagnosis is challenging. Our aims were to evaluate the clinical presentations, the process to confirm the diagnosis and followed-up the patients who had undergone laparoscopy at our center. FGTB has been reported from many countries, but has never been reported from Indonesia. Here we present case studies to document the presence of FGTB in Indonesia. CASES PRESENTATION: There were three patients admitted to our center; two patients were admitted with irregular menstrual cycle as their chief complaint, while one patient came due to infertility. The results from laparoscopy were suggestive of FGTB; including the presence of caseating granulomas surrounded by epithelioid cells, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and Langhans giant cells. Additionally, PCR testing confirmed presence of MTB. Subsequent to diagnosis, continuous TB medications was administered with excellent clinical outcome in two patients (pregnant in 18 months after under gone laparoscopy). The infertile patient remain in one of the treated patient above. CONCLUSION: In infertile patients who live in countries where Tuberculosis is an endemic disease, such as Indonesia, a comprehensive history taking, along with ultrasonography results can be used to diagnose FGTB. Confirmation of this diagnosis can be achieved through polymerase chain reactions result. Timely diagnosis and treatment are imperative to prevent any permanent injury to patient's reproductive organs.","Djuwantono T, Permadi W, Septiani L, Faried A, Halim D, Parwati I",BMC Res Notes,2017 Dec 4,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
38498488,"Tuberculin skin test and Interferon-gamma release assay agreement, and associated factors with latent tuberculosis infection, in medical and nursing students in Bandung, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: No gold standard diagnostic test exists for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). The intra-dermal tuberculin skin test (TST) has known limitations and Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) have been developed as an alternative. We aimed to assess agreement between IGRA and TST, and risk factors for test positivity, in Indonesian healthcare students. METHODS: Medical and nursing students starting their clinical training were screened using IGRA and TST. Agreement between the two tests was measured using Cohen's Kappa coefficient. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with test positivity. RESULTS: Of 266 students, 43 (16.2%) were IGRA positive and 85 (31.9%) TST positive. Agreement between the two tests was 74.7% (kappa 0.33, 95% CI 0.21-0.45, P<0.0001). Students who had direct contact with family or friends with TB were less likely to be test positive using IGRA (AOR 0.18, 95% CI 0.05-0.64) and using TST (AOR 0.51, 95% CI 0.26-0.99). CONCLUSION: Test positivity for LTBI was lower when measured by IGRA than by TST, with poor agreement between the two tests. Known close TB contact was unexpectedly negatively associated with positivity by either test. Longitudinal studies may be required to help determine the best test for LTBI in healthcare students in Indonesia.","Apriani L, McAllister S, Sharples K, Aini IN, Nurhasanah H, Ratnaningsih DF, Indrati AR, Ruslami R, Alisjahbana B, van Crevel R, Hill PC",PLoS One,2024,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
33971053,Serious fungal disease incidence and prevalence in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Indonesia is a tropical country, warm and humid, with numerous environmental fungi. Data on fungal disease burden help policymakers and clinicians. OBJECTIVES: We have estimated the incidence and prevalence of serious fungal diseases. METHODS: We found all published and unpublished data and estimated the incidence and prevalence of fungal diseases based on populations at risk. HIV data were derived from UNAIDS (2017), pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) data from 2013-2019, data on chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) were used to estimate CPA prevalence and likely deaths, COPD data from Hammond (2020), lung cancer incidence was from Globocan 2018, and fungal rhinosinusitis was estimated using community data from India. RESULTS: Overall ~7.7 million Indonesians (2.89%) have a serious fungal infection each year. The annual incidence of cryptococcosis in AIDS was 7,540. Pneumocystis pneumonia incidence was estimated at 15,400 in HIV and an equal number in non-HIV patients. An estimated 1% and 0.2% of new AIDS patients have disseminated histoplasmosis or Talaromyces marneffei infection. The incidence of candidaemia is 26,710. The annual incidence of invasive aspergillosis was estimated at 49,500 and the prevalence of CPA is at 378,700 cases. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis prevalence in adults is estimated at 336,200, severe asthma with fungal sensitisation at 443,800, and fungal rhinosinusitis at 294,000. Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis is estimated at 5 million/year (15-50 years old). The incidence of fungal keratitis around 40,050. Tinea capitis prevalence in schoolchildren about 729,000.

26075722,Effects of Introducing Xpert MTB/RIF on Diagnosis and Treatment of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis Patients in Indonesia: A Pre-Post Intervention Study.,"BACKGROUND: In March 2012, the Xpert MTB/RIF assay (Xpert) was introduced in three provincial public hospitals in Indonesia as a novel diagnostic to detect tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance among high risk individuals. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the effects of using Xpert in place of conventional solid and liquid culture and drug-susceptibility testing on case detection rates, treatment initiation rates, and health system delays among drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) patients. METHODS: Cohort data on registration, test results and treatment initiation were collected from routine presumptive patient registers one year before and one year after Xpert was introduced. Proportions of case detection and treatment initiation were compared using the Pearson Chi square test and median time delays using the Mood's Median test. RESULTS: A total of 975 individuals at risk of drug-resistant TB were registered in the pre-intervention year and 1,442 in the post-intervention year. After Xpert introduction, TB positivity rate increased by 15%, while rifampicin resistance rate reduced by 23% among TB positive cases and by 9% among all tested. Second-line TB treatment initiation rate among rifampicin resistant patients increased by 19%. Time from client registration to diagnosis was reduced by 74 days to a median of a single day (IQR 0-4) and time from diagnosis to treatment start was reduced by 27 days to a median of 15 days (IQR 7-51). All findings were significant with p<0.001. CONCLUSION: Compared to solid and liquid culture and drug-susceptibility testing, Xpert detected more TB and less rifampicin resistance, increased second-line treatment initiation rates and shortened time to diagnosis and treatment. This test holds promise to improve rapid case finding and management of drug-resistant TB patients in Indonesia.","van Kampen SC, Susanto NH, Simon S, Astiti SD, Chandra R, Burhan E, Farid MN, Chittenden K, Mustikawati DE, Alisjahbana B",PLoS One,2015,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
38916383,"Comparison of Individual Regimen Containing Bedaquiline with Delamanid and Bedaquiline without Delamanid on Efficacy and Safety in Multidrug-resistant Tuberculosis Patients: Implementation in Dr. Soetomo General Academic Hospital, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: Bedaquiline is one of the core drugs used to treat multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). Delamanid is one of the companion drugs in group C which is used to complete the treatment regimen when drugs in groups A and B can not be used. This study was conducted to analyze the efficacy and safety between individual regimens containing bedaquiline with delamanid and bedaquiline without delamanid. METHODS: This was an observational analytic study with a retrospective design in MDR-TB patients treated with individual regimens containing bedaquiline with delamanid (bedaquiline-delamanid group) and bedaquiline without delamanid (bedaquiline group). Efficacy was measured according to the time to Acid Fast Bacilli (AFB) conversion and Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture conversion, while safety was measured specifically on QTc interval prolongation. RESULTS: The median (range) time to AFB conversion in bedaquiline-delamanid group was faster than bedaquiline group, although there was no significant difference (1.5 (1-4) months vs. 1 (1-6) months, P=0.429), the median time to culture conversion in bedaquiline-delamanid group also faster than bedaquiline group, although there was no significant difference (1 (1-6) months vs. 2 (1-6) months, P=0.089). The incidence of QTc interval prolongation in bedaquiline-delamanid group was less than bedaquiline group, although there was no significant difference (26.9% vs. 40.3%, P=0.223). CONCLUSIONS: Individual regimens containing bedaquiline with delamanid was proven to provide similar efficacy and safety profiles with individual regimens containing bedaquiline without delamanid. Delamanid should be preferred when selecting drugs to complete the treatment regimen when drugs in groups A and B can not be used.","Soedarsono S, Mertaniasih NM, Kusmiati T, Permatasari A, Subay S, Adiono SH",Int J Mycobacteriol,2024 Apr 1,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
19460253,"Malnutrition and socio-demographic factors associated with pulmonary tuberculosis in Timor and Rote Islands, Indonesia.","OBJECTIVE: To identify nutritional and socio-demographic factors for the development of tuberculosis (TB) in Timor and Rote Island, Indonesia, so that intervention programmes can be developed to address these factors. METHODS: In a case-control study, we enrolled new sputum smear-positive pulmonary TB patients as cases, and neighbours matched for sex and age as controls. Data obtained included history of TB, socio-demographic factors and nutritional status. RESULTS: In the study, 121 TB patients and 371 controls participated. The mean age was 30 years: 56.3% were male and 43.7% female. Of the TB patients, 87% had malnutrition compared to 33% among controls. The mean body mass index (BMI) of the patients was significantly lower than that of the controls (16.1 +/- 2.3 kg/m(2) vs. 19.4 +/- 3.0 kg/m(2)). Factors associated with the development of TB were BMI (OR 0.5, 95%CI 0.4-0.6), family history of TB (OR 3.2, 95%CI 1.6-6.4), living in an extended family (OR 2.7, 95%CI 1.5-4.8), being non-indigenous to Timor and Rote Islands (OR 2.9, 95%CI 1.2-6.8) and being unemployed (OR 3.8, 95%CI 1.7-8.6). CONCLUSION: Among patients with active pulmonary TB, the prevalence of malnutrition was very high. Malnutrition, which is a general problem for the whole community and particularly among people not indigenous to Timor and Rote, should be addressed in the fight against TB.","Pakasi TA, Karyadi E, Dolmans WM, van der Meer JW, van der Velden K",Int J Tuberc Lung Dis,2009 Jun,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
37338471,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis - atpE gene profile of bedaquiline-treated pulmonary tuberculosis patients at the referral hospital Dr. Soetomo, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: The atpE gene is a target for bedaquiline (Bdq)-activating drug action and mutations in the gene are fixed to cause resistance. However, changes in the amino acid of ATPase have been little reported from a clinical setting since it was first used in 2015 in Indonesia. This study aims to observe the sequence of nucleotide and amino acid from rifampicin-resistant (RR) pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients, both new and relapse cases treated with Bdq. METHODS: This is an observational descriptive study performed in the referral hospital Dr Soetomo, Indonesia, at August 2022-November 2022. We performed Sanger sequencing and comparison of the atpE gene from the patient's sputum from August to November 2022 to wild-type Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv and species of mycobacteria using BioEdit version 7.2 and BLAST NCBI software. We also conducted an epidemiological study on patients' characteristics. This study uses a descriptive statistic to show the percentage of data. RESULTS: The total of 12 M. tuberculosis isolates showed that the atpE gene sequence was 100% similar to the wild-type M. tuberculosis H37Rv. No single-nucleotide polymorphisms or mutations were found, and no change in the amino acid structure at position 28 (Asp), 61 (Glu), 63 (Ala), and 66 (Ile). The percentage identity of atpE to M. tuberculosis H37Rv and M. tuberculosis complex was 99%-100%, while the similarity with the other mycobacteria species other than TB (Mycobacterium avium complex, Mycobacterium abscessus, and Mycobacterium lepraemurium) was 88%-91%. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed M. tuberculosis -atpE gene sequence profile of RR-TB patients had no mutations, as the specific gene region, and no change in the amino acid structure. Therefore, Bdq can be continually trusted as an effective anti-tubercular drug in RR-TB patients.","Setyawan MF, Mertaniasih NM, Soedarsono S, Nuha Z, Maladan Y, Matsumoto S",Int J Mycobacteriol,2023 Apr-Jun,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
16799215,Clinical tuberculosis problems and management.,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic disease caused by M. tuberculosis. WHO (World Health Organization) 1993 has estimated that one third of world population has been infected by M. tuberculosis bacillus. It is also estimated that 8 million people contract the disease annually and two to three million deaths occur every year due to TB. Major factors that have aggravated the spread of TB are: 1) ineffective TB control programs, leading to the development of multi drug resistant bacilli, 2) co infection with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) where TB progress rapidly and deadly,3) existence of other co-morbid that need higher expert (Internist etc). Vaccination with BCG does not seem to protect the adult population consistently and effectively from developing pulmonary TB, and has had no significant impact on the global TB epidemiology. Tuberculosis in Indonesia results in high death rate because it is the second highest infection with national prevalence rate of 0.24%. Effective medicine standard of anti-tuberculosis is available, but many obstacles in the program from lack of knowledge among health officers, low consciousness and compliances of person with tuberculosis to carry out the treatment schedule and so on make the success of TB eradication unsatisfied. Clinical appearances of TB are multiple with non-specific symptoms, the cases that are exposed to similar source of infection but will show different clinical consequence from mild to severe. Nevertheless, with the rise of multi drug resistance strains of M. tuberculosis, the spread of HIV infection and the variation of BCG efficacy, the search for more powerful drugs, more effective vaccines, better diagnostics and other intervention strategies have become an urgent goal worldwide.

We aimed to synthesise relevant evidence to define best practice approaches and identify policy and research gaps. OBJECTIVE: To systematically appraise evidence for the effectiveness of spatially targeted community public health interventions for HIV, tuberculosis (TB), leprosy and malaria. DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: We searched Medline, Embase, Global Health, Web of Science and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews between 1 January 1993 and 22 March 2021. STUDY SELECTION: The studies had to include HIV or TB or leprosy or malaria and spatial hotspot definition, and community interventions. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: A data extraction tool was used. For each study, we summarised approaches to identifying hotpots, intervention design and effectiveness of the intervention. RESULTS: Ten studies, including one cluster randomised trial and nine with alternative designs (before-after, comparator area), satisfied our inclusion criteria. Spatially targeted interventions for HIV (one USA study), TB (three USA) and leprosy (two Brazil, one Federated States of Micronesia) each used household location and disease density to define hotspots followed by community-based screening. Malaria studies (one each from India, Indonesia and Kenya) used household location and disease density for hotspot identification followed by complex interventions typically combining community screening, larviciding of stagnant water bodies, indoor residual spraying and mass drug administration. Evidence of effect was mixed. CONCLUSIONS: Studies investigating spatially targeted interventions were few in number, and mostly underpowered or otherwise limited methodologically, affecting interpretation of intervention impact. Applying advanced epidemiological methodologies supporting more robust hotspot identification and larger or more intensive interventions would strengthen the evidence-base for this increasingly important approach.

METHODS: this is a cross-sectional study of the TB-HIV patients at National HIV Center POKDISUS, Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in 2008-2011. We classified TB form as pulmonary TB, extrapulmonary TB, milliary TB, and combination form. The data were analyzed by Spearman and lambda correlation test. We also did partial correlation test to eliminate some counfounding factors, including demography and clinical characteristics, that had been determinated before. RESULTS: there were 122 TB-HIV patients (aged median 31 [18-34], 80% male) included in this study. The most common TB form was pulmonary TB (71.2%), then extrapulmonary TB (7.4%), the combined type (18.9%), and milliary TB (2.5%). Median of CD4+ count was 40 cells/mL (IQR 17.5-100.6). There was a very weak correlation between CD4+ count and TB form in TB-HIV patients in Indonesia (r=0.185; p=0.042). The other factor that also showed a significant correlation to TB form is HIV staging (r=0.289; p=0.001). After adjusting those factors, we found an increase on correlation between CD4+ count and TB form (r=0.353; p=0.000).

20459665,Missed opportunity for standardized diagnosis and treatment among adult tuberculosis patients in hospitals involved in Public-Private Mix for Directly Observed Treatment Short-Course strategy in Indonesia: a cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: The engagement of hospitals in Public-Private Mix (PPM) for Directly Observed Treatment Short-Course (DOTS) strategy has increased rapidly internationally - including in Indonesia. In view of the rapid global scaling-up of hospital engagement, we aimed to estimate the proportion of outpatient adult Tuberculosis patients who received standardized diagnosis and treatment at outpatients units of hospitals involved in the PPM-DOTS strategy. METHODS: A cross-sectional study using morbidity reports for outpatients, laboratory registers and Tuberculosis patient registers from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2005. By quota sampling, 62 hospitals were selected. Post-stratification analysis was conducted to estimate the proportion of Tuberculosis cases receiving standardized management according to the DOTS strategy. RESULT: Nineteen to 53% of Tuberculosis cases and 4-18% of sputum smear positive Tuberculosis cases in hospitals that participated in the PPM-DOTS strategy were not treated with standardized diagnosis and treatment as in DOTS. CONCLUSION: This study found that a substantial proportion of TB patients cared for at PPM-DOTS hospitals are not managed under the DOTS strategy. This represents a missed opportunity for standardized diagnoses and treatment. A combination of strong individual commitment of health professionals, organizational supports, leadership, and relevant policy in hospital and National Tuberculosis Programme may be required to strengthen DOTS implementation in hospitals.","Probandari A, Lindholm L, Stenlund H, Utarini A, Hurtig AK",BMC Health Serv Res,2010 May 7,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia

RESULTS: Of 590 PLWD, 101 had died and 163 could not be contacted or refused. Among the 326 who were re-examined, 6 (1.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.7 to 4.0) reported being diagnosed already and a further 5 were diagnosed with active TB (1.5%; 95% CI 0.50 to 3.5). The TB incidence rate was 9.85 (95% CI 4.03 to 15.68) per 1000 person-years. TB incidence was higher among PLWD with baseline LTBI (17.13; 95% CI 5.25 to 29.00/1000 person-years) compared with those without LTBI (4.79; 95% CI -0.63 to 10.21), with an incidence rate ratio of 3.57 (95% CI 0.86 to 20.92; p=0.054). CONCLUSIONS: PLWD with LTBI in Indonesia and similar settings are likely to benefit from TB preventive therapy.","McAllister SM, Koesoemadinata RC, Santoso P, Soetedjo NNM, Kamil A, Permana H, Ruslami R, Critchley JA, van Crevel R, Hill PC, Alisjahbana B",Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,2020 Feb 7,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
32334545,"Strategic priorities for TB control in Bangladesh, Indonesia, and the Philippines - comparative analysis of national TB prevalence surveys.","BACKGROUND: Philippines, Indonesia, and Bangladesh are three high tuberculosis (TB) burden countries in Asia which account for 18% of the estimated global TB incidence (1.8 million) and 15% of TB related deaths (192,000). In 2017 alone, approximately 785,000 of the incident TB cases in these countries remained missing, including diagnosed but not notified. METHODS: We reviewed the published data from the most recent TB prevalence surveys conducted in Bangladesh, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The prevalence rates established by the surveys were used to estimate the disease burden of these countries for 2017. The Global TB Report 2017 and World Health Organization's (WHO) global TB database were sourced for collection of incidence and notification data by age groups and types of TB to estimate prevalence to notification gaps 2017. RESULTS: According to the surveys, the estimated prevalence rates of bacteriologically confirmed TB and smear-positive TB are 287 and 113 for Bangladesh (2015-16), 759 and 256 for Indonesia (2013-14) and 1159 and 434 for the Philippines (2016) per 100,000 population over the age of 15 years. The overall national TB prevalence estimates for all forms is 260 for Bangladesh, 660 for Indonesia, and 970 for the Philippines (2016). Compared with the incidence rate, the proportion of total notified cases is 67% for Bangladesh, 52% for Indonesia, and 55% for the Philippines. Bangladesh has been able to detect almost 100% of the prevalent pulmonary TB, while Indonesia and Philippines have detected only 30 and 22% of these infectious cases respectively. Although notification has been improving over the years, there is no impact on the incidence rate since a large proportion of the undiagnosed cases, and delayed diagnosis continue to feed the transmission process. CONCLUSION: The surveys have provided data that is critical for developing realistic strategies for these countries to eliminate TB. In general, this paper recommends interventions for strengthening diagnosis of pulmonary TB, implementing targeted communication programs and active case finding to reduce patient level delays, expanding public-private partnership to increase access to TB services, using rapid diagnostics, and providing social protection for vulnerable populations. These measures can accelerate these countries' progress towards achieving End TB goals.","Kak N, Chakraborty K, Sadaphal S, AlMossawi HJ, Calnan M, Vikarunnessa B",BMC Public Health,2020 Apr 25,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
20438789,"Association of HLA-A, -B, and -DRB1 with pulmonary tuberculosis in western Javanese Indonesia.","Genetic studies of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), including those of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, have been reported in several populations. Some studies also have reported these genes to have a stronger role in severe tuberculosis. We investigated HLA class I and II alleles and haplotypes to ascertain their role in susceptibility and resistance to new and recurrent PTB in 257 PTB patients (216 new and 41 recurrent PTB patients) and 236 healthy controls in Western Javanese (Indonesia). HLA-B*4006 was associated with new PTB (p = 0.044, p(adj) = ns), whereas HLA-B*1802, HLA-B*4001 and HLA-DRB1*1101 were associated with recurrent PTB (p = 0.013, p(adj) = 0.016; p = 0.015, p(adj) = 0.028; and p = 0.008, p(adj) = 0.027 for new PTB vs recurrent PTB, respectively). Except for HLA-B*4006, those associations remained significant after adjustment for age and gender by logistic regression analysis, although they disappeared after correction for multiple testing. Haplotype HLA-B*1802-DRB1*1202 was associated with susceptibility to recurrent PTB (p = 0.014, odds ratio = 3.8, 95% confidence interval = 1.18-12.27). In contrast, HLA-DRB1*1202 in the absence of HLA-B*1802 showed a significant association with resistance to recurrent PTB (p = 8.2 x 10(-4), odds ratio = 0.32, 95% confidence interval = 0.16-0.64), suggesting that stronger susceptibility effect of HLA-B*1802 masked the protective effect of HLA-DRB1*1202. Further studies using larger number of patients with recurrent PTB will be needed to confirm our findings.","Yuliwulandari R, Sachrowardi Q, Nakajima H, Kashiwase K, Hirayasu K, Mabuchi A, Sofro AS, Tokunaga K",Hum Immunol,2010 Jul,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
37345429,Varied trends of tuberculosis and HIV dual epidemics among different countries during 2000-2020: lessons from an ecological time-trend study of 9 countries.,"BACKGROUND: While Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection is a well-established risk factor for tuberculosis (TB), the effect of HIV infection on TB incidence varies across countries given differences in local epidemiological factors and disparate progress with respect to TB elimination goals. METHODS: In this descriptive epidemiological study, we explored the country-specific associations between HIV prevalence and TB incidence in nine countries representing four WHO regions using data between 2000 and 2020. For each of these countries, we (1) described the trends of TB incidence and HIV prevalence, and (2) examined country-level associations between TB incidence and HIV prevalence, using negative binomial regression. RESULTS: The trends of TB incidence and HIV prevalence, and the country-level associations, varied across the study countries. Angola, Thailand and Zimbabwe showed parallel TB incidence and HIV prevalence trends while the two trends diverged in Brazil, Liberia and Indonesia during the study period. Additionally, the strength of association between HIV prevalence and TB incidence varied widely between countries, with the risk ratio ranging from 0.42 (95% CI: 0.36, 0.49) in Indonesia to 2.78 (95% CI: 2.57, 3.02) in Thailand. CONCLUSIONS: The association of HIV infection with TB incidence varied across high burden settings, suggesting that HIV is not a ubiquitous driver of TB incidence. Without acknowledging the local drivers of TB epidemics across countries, the END TB Strategy cannot be adapted at the country level. The findings from this analysis can inform the design of future studies to identify country-specific drivers of TB using individual-level data.","Preuc C, Humayun M, Yang Z",Infect Dis (Lond),2023 Aug,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
29117347,Quality Tuberculosis Care in Indonesia: Using Patient Pathway Analysis to Optimize Public-Private Collaboration.,"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is the fourth leading cause of death in Indonesia. In 2015, the World Health Organization estimated that nearly two-thirds of the TB patients in Indonesia had not been notified, and the status of their care remained unknown. As such, Indonesia is home to nearly 20% of the world's ""missing"" TB patients. Understanding where patients go for care may enable strategic planning of services to better reach them. METHODS: A patient pathway analysis (PPA) was conducted to assess the alignment between patient care seeking and the availability of TB diagnostic and treatment services at the national and subnational level in Indonesia. RESULTS: The PPA results revealed that only 20% of patients encountered diagnostic capacity at the location where they first sought care. Most initial care seeking occurred in the private sector and case notification lagged behind diagnostic confirmation in the public sector. CONCLUSIONS: The PPA results emphasize the role that the private sector plays in TB patient care seeking and suggested a need for differentiated approaches, by province, to respond to variances in care-seeking patterns and the capacities of public and private providers.","Surya A, Setyaningsih B, Suryani Nasution H, Gita Parwati C, Yuzwar YE, Osberg M, Hanson CL, Hymoff A, Mingkwan P, Makayova J, Gebhard A, Waworuntu W",J Infect Dis,2017 Nov 6,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
39747050,Immune correlates of early clearance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis among tuberculosis household contacts in Indonesia.,"Some individuals, even when heavily exposed to an infectious tuberculosis patient, do not develop a specific T-cell response as measured by interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). This could be explained by an IFN-gamma-independent adaptive immune response, or an effective innate host response clearing Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) without adaptive immunity. In heavily exposed Indonesian tuberculosis household contacts (n = 1347), a persistently IGRA negative status was associated with presence of a BCG scar, and - especially among those with a BCG scar - with altered innate immune cells dynamics, higher heterologous (Escherichia coli-induced) proinflammatory cytokine production, and higher inflammatory proteins in the IGRA mitogen tube. Neither circulating concentrations of Mtb-specific antibodies nor functional antibody activity associated with IGRA status at baseline or follow-up. In a cohort of adults in a low tuberculosis incidence setting, BCG vaccination induced heterologous innate cytokine production, but only marginally affected Mtb-specific antibody profiles. Our findings suggest that a more efficient host innate immune response, rather than a humoral response, mediates early clearance of Mtb. The protective effect of BCG vaccination against Mtb infection may be linked to innate immune priming, also termed 'trained immunity'.","Setiabudiawan TP, Apriani L, Verrall AJ, Utami F, Schneider M, Indrati AR, Halim PP, Kaplonek P, Malca H, Lee JS, Moorlag SJCFM, de Bree LCJ, Mourits VP, Joosten LAB, Netea MG, Alisjahbana B, McNamara RP, Alter G, van Laarhoven A, Ussher JE, Sharples K, Koeken VACM, Hill PC, van Crevel R",Nat Commun,2025 Jan 2,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
35395745,The co-management of tuberculosis-diabetes co-morbidities in Indonesia under the National Tuberculosis Control Program: results from a cross-sectional study from 2017 to 2019.,"BACKGROUND: Indonesia suffers from a high burden of tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes (DM). The government initiated national TB-DM co-management activities under the National TB Control Program in 2017. This study investigates the detection and treatment outcomes of TB-DM in Jakarta after implementing these activities, and identifies the main factors associated with these outcomes. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using TB registry data in two districts of Jakarta, East Jakarta (low-income) and South Jakarta (high-income). A 5-step cascade analysis was used: diagnosed TB patients; TB patients tested for DM; diagnosed TB-DM patients; and patients received and completed TB treatment/cured. We conducted descriptive analyses to understand the characteristics of TB and TB-DM patients, and used a two-level mixed-effect logistic regression to explore factors associated with having a DM test and completing TB treatment/being cured. RESULTS: Over the study period (2017-2019) 50.8% of the new pulmonary TB patients aged over 15 were tested for DM. The percentage increased from 41.7% in 2017-2018 to 60.1% in 2019. Of the TB patients tested for DM, 20.8% were diagnosed with DM. Over 90% of the detected TB-DM patients received standard TB treatment, 86.3% of whom completed treatment/were cured. Patients in East Jakarta were more likely to be tested for DM and to complete standard TB treatment/be cured than patients in South Jakarta (P <  0.001). Bacteriologically positive TB patients were more likely to be tested for DM (OR = 1.37, 95% CIs 1.17,1.60). Patients diagnosed in sub-district level healthcare centers had a higher likelihood of being tested for DM than those in government and private hospitals (P <  0.05). Receiving DM treatment was associated with a higher likelihood of completing TB treatment/being cured (OR = 1.82, 95% CIs 1.20, 2.77). CONCLUSIONS: TB-DM case detection significantly improved in 2019 after introducing TB-DM co-management activities in Jakarta, while gaps in TB-DM co-management existed between bacteriologically positive and clinically diagnosed TB patients, and across different types of health facilities. Collaboration between TB and DM departments should be strengthened, and more resources need to be mobilized to further improve the co-management of TB-DM in Indonesia.","Jiang W, Trimawartinah, Rahman FM, Wibowo A, Sanjaya A, Silitonga PII, Tang S, Long Q",BMC Public Health,2022 Apr 8,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
35177037,"Challenges, opportunities, and potential roles of the private primary care providers in tuberculosis and diabetes mellitus collaborative care and control: a qualitative study.","INTRODUCTION: The comorbidity of tuberculosis and diabetes mellitus (TB-DM) is a looming global co-epidemic problem. Despite the Indonesian Government's ongoing effort to impose regulation for collaborative TB-DM management, the involvement of private primary care providers (PPCs) has not been considered before the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to capture the PPCs' existing practices and explore their challenges, opportunities, and potential roles in the collaborative TB-DM services and control. METHODS: A descriptive qualitative research design was used to collect data. Two Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were conducted with 13 healthcare workers (HCWs) from different private clinics and eight private/solo general practitioners (GPs) from Yogyakarta City, Indonesia. We triangulated these data with data from FGDs of HCWs community health centers (CHCs) and in-depth interviews of three regional health regulators, five hospitals staff members, and a representative of national health insurance. The discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and subjected to thematic analysis. RESULTS: PPCs have not been initiated into the implementation of the collaborative TB-DM programme. The themes identified in this study were health system-related barriers, knowledge and perception of HCWs, lack of implementation of bi-directional screening, and needs of multisector role. The potential roles identified for PPCs include involvement in health promotion, bi-directional screening, patient referral, and data reporting according to the TB-DM programme indicators. However, more thorough improvement of PPCs' capacity and logistic supplies are needed to provide comprehensive TB treatment. CONCLUSION: Although PPCs' involvement in implementing collaborative TB-DM services has yet to be considered, their potential role should not be neglected. Therefore, it is essential to increase their involvement by enhancing their capacity and improving the Public-Private Mix. PPCs' engagement should be initiated and maintained to ensure the sustainability of the programme.","Arini M, Sugiyo D, Permana I",BMC Health Serv Res,2022 Feb 17,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
18571213,"Voluntary counselling and testing uptake and HIV prevalence among tuberculosis patients in Jogjakarta, Indonesia.","We aimed to establish HIV prevalence and uptake of unlinked anonymous testing and voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) among tuberculosis (TB) patients in Jogjakarta, Indonesia. We introduced unlinked anonymous HIV testing for TB patients attending directly observed treatment, short-course services between April and December 2006. Patients were additionally offered VCT services. Of 1269 TB patients who were offered unlinked anonymous testing, 989 (77.9%; 95% CI 75.6-80.1%) accepted. HIV prevalence was 1.9% (95% CI 1.6-2.2%). HIV infections were less frequently diagnosed among TB patients who attended a public health centre [odds ratio (OR) 0.15; 95% CI 0.03-0.70] rather than public hospital. They were more frequent in TB patients with a university education background (OR 5.16; 95% CI 1.01-26.63) or a history of HIV testing (OR 57.87; 95% CI 9.42-355.62). Of the 989 patients who accepted unlinked anonymous testing, only 133 (13.4%; 95% CI 11.5-15.7%) expressed interest in VCT. Of these, 52 (39.1%; 95% CI 31.2-47.6%) attended VCT, but interest was higher among students and those offered VCT by public health centres. The HIV prevalence in Jogjakarta is higher than expected and needs to be monitored cautiously. Unlinked anonymous HIV testing is well accepted and can be implemented with modest additional efforts.","Mahendradhata Y, Ahmad RA, Kusuma TA, Boelaert M, Van der Werf MJ, Kimerling ME, Van der Stuyft P",Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,2008 Oct,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
11605885,"High tuberculosis notification and treatment success rates through community participation in central Sulawesi, Republic of Indonesia.","SETTING: Central Sulawesi Province, Republic of Indonesia. OBJECTIVE: To increase tuberculosis case notification and maintain high treatment success rates through community participation in a tuberculosis field programme. DESIGN: Comparison of tuberculosis case notification and treatment results in a community based tuberculosis programme (CBTP), before and after introduction of the programme and between areas where the programme was and was not introduced. RESULTS: During 1998, the CBTP was introduced in two of the four rural districts of the Central Sulawesi province, covering 224 (29%) of the 772 villages and 362,700 (33%) of the 1,109,100 population in these districts. In the CBTP villages the notification rate of new smear-positive patients per 100,000 population increased from SI in 1996 and 48 in 1997 to 166 in 1998. In the 548 non-CBTP villages the rates were 62, 60 and 70, respectively. The sputum conversion rate at the end of the first 2 months of the treatment was over 85% in both the CBTP and the non-CBTP villages. In the CBTP villages the treatment success rate (cure and treatment completion) was 90.4%, 89.5% and 93.7% in 1996, 1997, and 1998. For the non-CBTP villages these rates were respectively 85.4%, 86.8% and 85.9%. In 1998 the sputum conversion and treatment success rates were significantly higher in the CBTP villages than in the non-CBTP villages. CONCLUSION: Through community participation, the notification of new smear-smear positive patients increased substantially, while sputum conversion and treatment success rates remained high.","Becx-Bleumink M, Wibowo H, Apriani W, Vrakking H",Int J Tuberc Lung Dis,2001 Oct,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia
21396208,"Drug resistance among tuberculosis patients attending diagnostic and treatment centres in Makassar, Indonesia.","SETTING: Government tuberculosis (TB) diagnostic and treatment centres, Makassar, Indonesia. OBJECTIVE: To determine the proportions and patterns of resistance to commonly used TB drugs (isoniazid [INH], rifampicin, ethambutol and streptomycin) among pulmonary TB patients and assess potential risk factors for drug resistance. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. RESULTS: Of 657 recruited patients, 234 were culture-positive. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) results were available for 216 patients. Among these, 197 were infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (145 new and 52 previously treated). Isolates from 89 new (61.4%) and 31 previously treated (59.6%) patients were susceptible to all four drugs. Resistance to INH was high among both patient groups (28.3% of new vs. 34.6% of previously treated). Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) cases accounted for respectively 4.1% and 19.2% of these patients. Resistance to >2 drugs was high among previously treated patients (19.2%). MDR-TB cases were more likely to have a history of excess alcohol use (adjusted OR 4.01, 95%CI 1.28-12.53) and previous TB treatment (adjusted OR 6.28, 95%CI 2.01-19.64). CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of previous treatment history, many culture-positive TB patients were infected with INH-resistant isolates, and a significant proportion of previously treated patients were infected with MDR-TB. Treating culture-positive TB patients, especially previously treated patients, based on DST results should therefore be considered.","Massi MN, Wahyuni S, Halik H, Yusuf I, Leong FJ, Dick T, Phyu S",Int J Tuberc Lung Dis,2011 Apr,Tuberculosis AND Indonesia

Indonesia bears a heavy burden of the pandemic, counting the highest case prevalence and fatality rate in all of Southeast Asia. One hope remains in the groundbreaking universal effort in search of a vaccine against the causative virus SARS-CoV-2, which has shown success unparalleled in human vaccine development thus far. An array of modalities including novel techniques are being utilized as vaccine platforms, with the closest to phase III clinical trial completion being mRNA (manufactured by Moderna and BioNTech/Pfizer), inactivated virus (Sinovac, Sinopharm), viral vector (Oxford/AstraZeneca, Gamaleya, Janssen/Johnson&Johnson, CanSino), and protein subunit (Novavax).

The national trend shows no sign of decrease as 19 September 2020 the report sets a new mark of 4000 new cases in a day. The concept of controlling disease transmission relies on contacts suppression; and on the longer end, relies on vaccinations. As 27 September 2020, no vaccine is approved for use in the general population. Until then, countries should implement early, widespread, and strict disease mitigation strategies. While much remains to be learned on COVID-19, global evidence assert at least three strategies at the population level contributes to flatten the curve: mobility restriction, testing and isolation and rigorous contact-tracing.Indonesia is not on entire absences of actions, but the epidemic calls for more. The central government called for social distancing two weeks after the first case confirmed and regulation on the large scale social distancing (Pembatasan Sosial Berskala Besar/ PSBB) that restrict non-essential population mobility is enacted by April 2020. Recent evidence outlines test, tracing and isolation are effective in suppressing COVID-19 transmission. Minimizing testing and tracing delay, less than four days with coverage of 80% close contacts could prevent and reduce onwards transmission.That we need to more is indisputable. The vaccine is not a magic bullet; it is a long-term control measure and should be a complete series of careful and precise examinations. Indonesia will also likely require high coverage of vaccination to achieve herd immunity.

The objective of this study was to determine the levels of health literacy about COVID-19 vaccines and vaccinations (Vaccines and Vaccinations literacy-VL) in the Indonesian adult general population, assessing the perceptions of the respondents about current adult immunization and beliefs about vaccinations in general, and analyzing correlations of these variables with the VL levels. Methods: A cross-sectional study using a rapid survey was administered via the Internet. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics; the internal consistency of the VL scales was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha coefficient; the inter-correlation between the functional and interactive-critical VL questions, the underlying components (factors) and each question's load on the components were identified using a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). An alpha level lesser than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Responses to functional- and interactive/ critical- VL questions were acceptable and showed internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.817 and 0.699, respectively), lowest values observed were 0.806 for functional scale and 0.640 for the interactive-critical scale. The PCA demonstrated that there were two components accounting for 52.45% of the total variability. Approximately 60% of respondents were females (n=686). Almost all respondents used the internet to seek information regarding COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccinations. Many used at least one social media actively with 74.4% of respondents sometimes believing the validity of this information. Conclusions: High scores were observed in both functional- and interactive/ critical-VL, and were quite in a balance between sexes in the prior VL and higher in females for the latter; these were also closely related to the educational level and age group.

38259732,COVID-19 infection prevention and control for hospital workers in Indonesia.,"INTRODUCTION: The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019 led to a global pandemic, posing unprecedented challenges to healthcare systems, particularly in hospitals. PURPOSE: This study explores the intricacies of strategies employed for preventing and controlling COVID-19 in Indonesian hospitals, with a particular focus on the protocols, challenges, and solutions faced by healthcare professionals. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional analysis, we examined 27 hospitals and uncovered disparities in their preparedness levels. During our investigation, we observed the robust implementation of infection prevention measures, which encompassed stringent protocols, adequate ventilation, and proper use of personal protective equipment. However, shortcomings were identified in areas such as surveillance, mental health support, and patient management. DISCUSSION: This study underscores the importance of addressing these gaps, suggesting tailored interventions, and continuous training for healthcare staff. Effective leadership, positive team dynamics, and adherence to comprehensive policies emerge as pivotal factors. Hospitals should strengthen weak areas, ensure the ethical execution of emergency protocols, and integrate technology for tracking and improving standard operating procedures. By enhancing the knowledge and skills of healthcare workers and maintaining strong management practices, hospitals can optimize their efforts in COVID-19 prevention and control, thereby safeguarding the wellbeing of professionals, patients, and communities.","Modjo R, Lestari F, Tanjung H, Kadir A, Putra RS, Rahmadani M, Chaeruman AS, Lestari F, Sutanto J",Front Public Health,2023,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
33504691,"Institutionalising wastewater surveillance systems to minimise the impact of COVID-19: cases of Indonesia, Japan and Viet Nam.","This mini review describes the current status and challenges regarding institutionalisation of wastewater surveillance systems against COVID-19. Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater has been proposed to be a potential tool to understand the actual prevalence of COVID-19 in the community, and it could be an effective approach to monitor the trend during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, challenges to institutionalise wastewater surveillance systems are still abundant and unfolding at a rapid rate given that the international understanding regarding the scientific knowledge and socio-political impacts of COVID-19 are in the developing stages. To better understand the existing challenges and bottlenecks, a comparative study between Japan, Viet Nam, and Indonesia was carried out in the present study. Through gaining a better understanding of common issues as well as issues specific to each country, we hope to contribute to building a robust multistakeholder system to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater as an effective disease surveillance system for COVID-19.","Takeda T, Kitajima M, Huong NTT, Setiyawan AS, Setiadi T, Hung DT, Haramoto E",Water Sci Technol,2021 Jan,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
33885740,Maternal and Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality Among Pregnant Women With and Without COVID-19 Infection: The INTERCOVID Multinational Cohort Study.,"IMPORTANCE: Detailed information about the association of COVID-19 with outcomes in pregnant individuals compared with not-infected pregnant individuals is much needed. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risks associated with COVID-19 in pregnancy on maternal and neonatal outcomes compared with not-infected, concomitant pregnant individuals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cohort study that took place from March to October 2020, involving 43 institutions in 18 countries, 2 unmatched, consecutive, not-infected women were concomitantly enrolled immediately after each infected woman was identified, at any stage of pregnancy or delivery, and at the same level of care to minimize bias. Women and neonates were followed up until hospital discharge. EXPOSURES: COVID-19 in pregnancy determined by laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 and/or radiological pulmonary findings or 2 or more predefined COVID-19 symptoms. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measures were indices of (maternal and severe neonatal/perinatal) morbidity and mortality; the individual components of these indices were secondary outcomes. Models for these outcomes were adjusted for country, month entering study, maternal age, and history of morbidity. RESULTS: A total of 706 pregnant women with COVID-19 diagnosis and 1424 pregnant women without COVID-19 diagnosis were enrolled, all with broadly similar demographic characteristics (mean [SD] age, 30.2 [6.1] years). Overweight early in pregnancy occurred in 323 women (48.6%) with COVID-19 diagnosis and 554 women (40.2%) without. Women with COVID-19 diagnosis were at higher risk for preeclampsia/eclampsia (relative risk [RR], 1.76; 95% CI, 1.27-2.43), severe infections (RR, 3.38; 95% CI, 1.63-7.01), intensive care unit admission (RR, 5.04; 95% CI, 3.13-8.10), maternal mortality (RR, 22.3; 95% CI, 2.88-172), preterm birth (RR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.30-1.94), medically indicated preterm birth (RR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.56-2.51), severe neonatal morbidity index (RR, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.69-4.18), and severe perinatal morbidity and mortality index (RR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.66-2.75). Fever and shortness of breath for any duration was associated with increased risk of severe maternal complications (RR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.92-3.40) and neonatal complications (RR, 4.97; 95% CI, 2.11-11.69). Asymptomatic women with COVID-19 diagnosis remained at higher risk only for maternal morbidity (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.00-1.54) and preeclampsia (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.01-2.63). Among women who tested positive (98.1% by real-time polymerase chain reaction), 54 (13%) of their neonates tested positive. Cesarean delivery (RR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.18-3.91) but not breastfeeding (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.66-1.85) was associated with increased risk for neonatal test positivity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this multinational cohort study, COVID-19 in pregnancy was associated with consistent and substantial increases in severe maternal morbidity and mortality and neonatal complications when pregnant women with and without COVID-19 diagnosis were compared. The findings should alert pregnant individuals and clinicians to implement strictly all the recommended COVID-19 preventive measures.","Villar J, Ariff S, Gunier RB, Thiruvengadam R, Rauch S, Kholin A, Roggero P, Prefumo F, do Vale MS, Cardona-Perez JA, Maiz N, Cetin I, Savasi V, Deruelle P, Easter SR, Sichitiu J, Soto Conti CP, Ernawati E, Mhatre M, Teji JS, Liu B, Capelli C, Oberto M, Salazar L, Gravett MG, Cavoretto PI, Nachinab VB, Galadanci H, Oros D, Ayede AI, Sentilhes L, Bako B, Savorani M, Cena H, Garcia-May PK, Etuk S, Casale R, Abd-Elsalam S, Ikenoue S, Aminu MB, Vecciarelli C, Duro EA, Usman MA, John-Akinola Y, Nieto R, Ferrazi E, Bhutta ZA, Langer A, Kennedy SH, Papageorghiou AT",JAMA Pediatr,2021 Aug 1,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
33020330,Dilemma of Prioritising Health and the Economy During COVID-19 Pandemic in Indonesia.,"Since the detection of the first confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in early March 2020, 248,852 cases have been detected in Indonesia by 21 September 2020. At least 100 doctors have died from COVID-19 nationwide. Full large-scale social restriction was a temporary measure, followed by an early transition to the new normal era during the never-ending first wave in the country. Workers in industrial, retail, transport, and tourism fields suffered a significant decrease in work. Many countries are, however, in dilemma of protecting the health of the citizens and prioritising economy. Health should be prioritised because it is an important aspect of our lives for our economy. Poor health is estimated to reduce global gross domestic product (GDP) by 15% annually through premature deaths and potential loss of productivity of the working-age citizens. Pandemics also depress economy through decrease in both supply and demand. Data from flu pandemic a century ago suggested the importance of aggressiveness and speed of intervention. Taiwan's early action led to beneficial effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection rate and economy recovery. The target of enhancement of containment measures, provision of personal protective equipments, and testing and isolation facilities should be achieved earlier and be more than the projected demand.","Setiati S, Azwar MK",Acta Med Indones,2020 Jul,COVID-19 AND Indonesia

38321478,Vaccine hesitancy and equity: lessons learned from the past and how they affect the COVID-19 countermeasure in Indonesia.,"INTRODUCTION: Indonesia has made progress in increasing vaccine coverage, but equitable access remains challenging, especially in remote areas. Despite including vaccines in the National Immunization Program (NIP), coverage has not met WHO and UNICEF targets, with childhood immunization decreasing during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 vaccination has also experienced hesitancy, slowing efforts to end the pandemic. SCOPE: This article addresses the issue of vaccine hesitancy and its impact on vaccination initiatives amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. This article utilizes the vaccine hesitancy framework to analyze previous outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases and their underlying causes, ultimately providing recommendations for addressing the current situation. The analysis considers the differences between the pre-pandemic circumstances and the present and considers the implementation of basic and advanced strategies. KEY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION: Vaccine hesitancy is a significant challenge in the COVID-19 pandemic, and public health campaigns and community engagement efforts are needed to promote vaccine acceptance and uptake. Efforts to address vaccine hesitancy promote trust in healthcare systems and increase the likelihood of individuals seeking preventive health services. Vaccine hesitancy requires a comprehensive, culturally sensitive approach that considers local contexts and realities. Strategies should be tailored to specific cultural and societal contexts and monitored and evaluated.","Sinuraya RK, Nuwarda RF, Postma MJ, Suwantika AA",Global Health,2024 Feb 6,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
34119537,"Diabetes and COVID-19: The past, the present, and the future.","Diabetes, one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in the world, is strongly associated with a poor prognosis in COVID-19. Scrupulous blood sugar management is crucial, since the worse outcomes are closely associated with higher blood sugar levels in COVID-19 infection. Although recent observational studies showed that insulin was associated with mortality, it should not deter insulin use in hospitalized patients requiring tight glucose control. Back and forth dilemma in the past with regards to continue/discontinue certain medications used in diabetes have been mostly resolved. The initial fears of consequences related to continuing certain medications have been largely dispelled. COVID-19 also necessitates the transformation in diabetes care through the integration of technologies. Recent advances in health-related technologies, notably telemedicine and remote continuous glucose monitoring, have become essential in the management of diabetes during the pandemic. Today, these technologies have changed the landscape of medicine and become more important than ever. Being a high-risk population, patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, should be prioritized for vaccination. In the future, as the pandemic fades, the prevalence of non-communicable diseases is expected to rise due to lifestyle changes and medical issues/dilemma encountered during the pandemic.","Pranata R, Henrina J, Raffaello WM, Lawrensia S, Huang I",Metabolism,2021 Aug,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
36112927,"Political Partisanship, Trust, and Attitudes toward COVID-19 Vaccines in Indonesia.","CONTEXT: This study examines the extent to which political partisanship-measured as support for either the incumbent candidate for Indonesia's presidency, Joko Widodo (popularly known as Jokowi), or for Jokowi's challenger, Prabowo-affects individuals' risk perception of COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and refusal as well as beliefs about the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: The authors performed multinomial logistic and ordinary least squares regression analyses on a nationally representative sample of a national survey on public trust in COVID-19 vaccines and vaccinations that was conducted in December 2020. FINDINGS: Individuals who voted for Prabowo in the 2019 presidential election were more likely to have a lower level of willingness and a higher level of hesitancy to get the COVID-19 vaccine than those who cast their ballot for Jokowi as the Indonesian president. CONCLUSIONS: Political partisanship does matter in shaping individuals' hesitancy or refusal to receive the COVID-19 vaccine in Indonesia. The effect of partisanship is also significant in shaping individuals' trust in the efficacy and safety of the COVID-19 vaccine, but it is not significantly associated with individuals' risk perceptions.","Halimatusa'diyah I, Durriyah TL",J Health Polit Policy Law,2023 Feb 1,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
37124827,"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to COVID-19 in Indonesia: A post delta variant wave cross-sectional study.","INTRODUCTION: Public information and regulations related to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been widely published and continuously changed. The Indonesian government has responded to the emerging evidence by regularly updating its unprecedented and preventive measures against the transmission of COVID-19 to the public. It is important to understand how the public responded to these updates. This study aimed to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of Indonesians toward COVID-19 after the emergence of the delta variant wave. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among the adult population of non-healthcare workers in Indonesia through an online questionnaire using the SurveyMonkey platform. A total of 1,859 respondents completed this survey from September to October 2021. The knowledge, attitudes, and practices data were analyzed descriptively to find their frequency and percentage. A multivariate analysis was conducted to confirm the factors affecting the respondents' knowledge, attitudes, and practices with a p-value of <0.05 set as significant. RESULTS: Being female, having a higher education level, and having a higher frequency of access to COVID-19 news showed significant impacts on knowledge, attitudes, and practices (p<0.001). Older age stratification influenced the knowledge level (p<0.05) but had no significant effect on people's attitudes and practices toward COVID-19. Respondents' perceived probability of being exposed to COVID-19 (p < 0.05) and their COVID-19 infection frequency (p < 0.001) significantly influenced their knowledge. Household income and respondents' knowledge significantly affected their attitudes toward COVID-19. Furthermore, only their attitudes had a significant impact on the respondents' practices. Perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, and vaccination status did not significantly influence their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: After more than a year of the COVID-19 pandemic, Indonesians maintain their high level of knowledge, attitudes, and practices. COVID-19 disinformation must be combatted by strengthening authorized media, empowering communities, and improving governance among institutions during and post-pandemic.","Hafidz F, Adiwibowo IR, Kusila GR, Oktavia A, Saut B, Jaya C, Siregar DR, Dhanalvin E, Tania I, Johana J, Ruby M, Baros WA",Front Public Health,2023,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
35818654,Extrapulmonary Manifestations COVID-19.,"After being declared as a pandemic on March 11, 2020 by the World Health Organization, COVID-19 has affected 497 million people worldwide as of 9 April 2022. COVID-19 is a disease with a plethora of clinical manifestations, which extends to those beyond pulmonary signs and symptoms. Studies that report on the clinical presentation of COVID-19 rarely report specifically on cases with only extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19. Extrapulmonary clinical presentations of COVID-19 without pulmonary signs and symptoms is rare, and in such cases, COVID-19 is rarely suspected.We herewith describe four patients with extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19, with positive SARS-COV-2 PCR when the test was performed for initial patient screening. The first patient is a 44-year-old female who developed painful ulcer with burning sensation at the lateral side of the tongue along with low grade fever. This symptom appeared after the initial complaints of coughing and nasal congestion subsided.  The second patient is a 37-year-old male, who complained of red eyes  with itchiness and increased tear production for 3 days before seeing an ophthalmologist. The third patient is a 44-year-old female who developed burning sensation and soreness on her throat upon swallowing with fever and chills. These symptoms appear consecutively without any respiratory complaint. The fourth patient is a previously healthy, 30-year-old female, with a normal weight and BMI, and without any comorbidity, cardiovascular risk and neither personal nor family history of cardiovascular disease. In these 4 patients, COVID-19 stomatitis, conjunctivitis, pharyngitis and COVID-19-associated atrial fibrillation was subsequently diagnosed, respectively.In the pandemic stage of COVID-19, COVID-19 screening has often been routinely performed due to the high risk of transmission. However, the decrease in the number of COVID-19 cases may prompt physicians to perform SARS-COV-2 testing based on clinical suspicion. It is imperative to consider the likelihood of COVID-19 and perform SARS-COV-2 PCR in patients with extrapulmonary complaints that have persisting complaints despite treatment.","Nelwan EJ, Tunjungputri RN, Tetrasiwi EN, Lauditta RK, Nainggolan L",Acta Med Indones,2022 Apr,COVID-19 AND Indonesia

We used a stratified semi-random general population survey administered online through mobile devices from November 24th-December 31st 2020 for rapid assessment and dissemination, which received 1518 respondents. Our findings enabled us to generate a COVID-19 impact index at the regency level, indicating an urban-to-rural gradient in the degree of change in seafood consumption patterns, with rural areas incurring more changes. During COVID-19, 61% of respondents ate less seafood than normal, 66% stated seafood was more expensive, and 37% stated that the seafood they normally buy was not available. Respondents also bought 5% less fresh or raw seafood, and 4.3% more pre-cooked seafood products during the pandemic. Traditional markets, mobile vendors, and food stands remain the most frequent access points for seafood, although access decreased during the pandemic for all, with mini- and supermarket access slightly increasing. Raw and fresh seafood purchases from travelling merchants decreased 12.5% during the pandemic. A larger percentage of women (~10% more than men) eat fish at least once per week, and women eat a larger diversity of seafood products. However, men classified themselves on average in a higher income class than women both before and during the pandemic, and men were significantly more likely to agree that they had enough money to buy the food they wanted during the pandemic. Overall, respondents who indicated eating a higher frequency of fish per week, were significantly more likely to agree that they ate less fish during the pandemic. Respondents on Sumbawa island were significantly more likely to agree that the fisheries products were not available during the pandemic.","Partelow S, Nagel B, Paramita AO, Buhari N",PLoS One,2023,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
34783269,COVID-19 prevalence among healthcare workers in Jakarta and neighbouring areas in Indonesia during early 2020 pandemic.,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 disease has overwhelmed and disrupted healthcare services worldwide, particularly healthcare workers (HCW). HCW are essential workers performing any job in a healthcare setting who are potentially directly or indirectly exposed to infectious materials. Our retrospective cohort study aimed to determine the prevalence of COVID-19 infections among HCW in Jakarta and neighbouring areas during the first three months of the pandemic. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab specimens from HCW working at private and public hospitals in Jakarta and neighbouring areas were screened for SARS-CoV-2 between March and May 2020. Data on demography, clinical symptoms, contact history, and personal protective equipment (PPE) use were collected using standardised forms. RESULTS: Among 1201 specimens, 7.9% were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 with the majority coming from medical doctors (48.4%) and nurses (44.2%). 64.2% of the positive cases reported to have contact with suspect/confirmed COVID-19 cases, including 32 (52.2%) with patient and 3 (6.6%) with co-worker. The symptomatic HCW had a significantly lower median Ct value as compared to their asymptomatic counterpart (p < .001). Tendency to have a higher prevalence of pneumonia was observed in the age group of 40 - 49 and >/=50 years old. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlighted the necessity to implement proper preventive and surveillance strategies for this high-risk population including adherence to strict PPE protocol and appropriate training.Key MessageHealthcare workers (HCW), defined as those handling any job in a healthcare setting, are at the frontline of risk of infection as SARS-CoV-2 is easily transmitted through airborne droplets and direct contact with contaminated surfaces. The aim of our study is to attain a more comprehensive and accurate picture of the impact of COVID-19 on HCW during the earlier phase of the outbreak in Indonesia to develop effective strategies that protect the health and safety of this workforce. Our findings highlighted that COVID-19 infections in HCW were mostly acquired in healthcare settings, with significant consequences of pneumonia and hospitalisation occurring across all age groups.","Soebandrio A, Kusumaningrum T, Yudhaputri FA, Oktavianthi S, Safari D, Malik SG, Myint KSA",Ann Med,2021 Dec,COVID-19 AND Indonesia

West Java is Indonesia's most populous province and has a high susceptibility to the transmission of the disease, resulting in a significant number of COVID-19 cases. Therefore, this research aimed to determine the influencing factors as well as the spatial and temporal distribution of COVID-19 in West Java. Data on COVID-19 cases in West Java obtained from PIKOBAR were used. Spatial distribution was described using a choropleth, while the influencing factors were evaluated with regression analysis. To determine whether COVID-19s policies and events affected its temporal distribution, the cases detected were graphed daily or biweekly with information on those two variables. Furthermore, the cumulative incidence was described in the linear regression analysis model as being significantly influenced by vaccinations and greatly elevated by population density. The biweekly chart had a random pattern with sharp decreases or spikes in cumulative incidence changes. Spatial and temporal analysis helps greatly in understanding distribution patterns and their influencing factors, specifically at the beginning of the pandemic. Plans and strategies for control and assessment programs may be supported by this study material.","Putri DIP, Agustian D, Apriani L, Ilyas R",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2023 Feb 11,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
34106887,Epidemiology of COVID-19 in Indonesia: common source and propagated source as a cause for outbreaks.,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 outbreak first occurred in China and has developed throughout the world, including Indonesia. The Indonesian government reports that up to May 22, 2020 there have been 21,430 confirmed cases. The purpose of this study is to describe the epidemiology, clinical symptoms and comorbidities of COVID-19 as well as the various government interventions to reduce the rate of incidence. METHODOLOGY: A retrospective cohort study was designed. The population in this study is based data from the official Indonesian government website run by the Task Force for the Acceleration of Handling COVID-19. The sample was observed b March 2 to April 24, 2020. The total sample included 8,211 cases of patients diagnosed with COVID-19, among these 1,002 recovered and 689 died. Data analysis used percentages from various recorded epidemiological variables. RESULTS: The results showed that COVID-19 epidemiological features were mostly observed in men (56.5%) and patients of productive age (31-59 of age) by 57.5%; most deaths were recorded in patients aged > 60 years (43.6%). The most recurrent clinical symptom was cough (77.8%), the most recurrent comorbidity was hypertension (52.4%), and the province with the highest COVID-19 incidence was DKI Jakarta (34.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of common sources and propagated source was observed during the COVID-19 outbreak in Indonesia. Special attention should be given to protecting vulnerable populations such as children, health care providers, and the elderly. The community is expected to participate in preventing the transmission of COVID-19 by complying with health protocols.","Hikmawati I, Setiyabudi R",J Infect Dev Ctries,2021 May 31,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
35270431,Quality of National Disease Surveillance Reporting before and during COVID-19: A Mixed-Method Study in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Global COVID-19 outbreaks in early 2020 have burdened health workers, among them surveillance workers who have the responsibility to undertake routine disease surveillance activities. The aim of this study was to describe the quality of the implementation of Indonesia's Early Warning and Response Alert System (EWARS) for disease surveillance and to measure the burden of disease surveillance reporting quality before and during the COVID-19 epidemic in Indonesia. METHODS: A mixed-method approach was used. A total of 38 informants from regional health offices participated in Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and In-Depth Interview (IDI) for informants from Ministry of Health. The FGD and IDI were conducted using online video communication. Yearly completeness and timeliness of reporting of 34 provinces were collected from the application. Qualitative data were analyzed thematically, and quantitative data were analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: Major implementation gaps were found in poorly distributed human resources and regional infrastructure inequity. National reporting from 2017-2019 showed an increasing trend of completeness (55%, 64%, and 75%, respectively) and timeliness (55%, 64%, and 75%, respectively). However, the quality of the reporting dropped to 53% and 34% in 2020 concomitant with the SARS-CoV2 epidemic. CONCLUSIONS: Report completeness and timeliness are likely related to regional infrastructure inequity and the COVID-19 epidemic. It is recommended to increase report capacities with an automatic EWARS application linked systems in hospitals and laboratories.","Hardhantyo M, Djasri H, Nursetyo AA, Yulianti A, Adipradipta BR, Hawley W, Mika J, Praptiningsih CY, Mangiri A, Prasetyowati EB, Brye L",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2022 Feb 26,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
34055709,Public Perception and Hand Hygiene Behavior During COVID-19 Pandemic in Indonesia.,"Hand hygiene practices are important not only during the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, but also critical to prevent the possible spread of other infectious diseases. This study aims to examine the current hand hygiene behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, post pandemic behavior intentions, and the relationship between behavior, psychosocial and contextual factors. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from 28 May to 12 June 2020, with 896 valid responses obtained from Indonesian citizens over 18 years old. The survey questions included demographic characteristics, individual practices, risk perceptions, attitude, norm factors and ability factors related to hand hygiene during the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive analysis, chi square and multiple logistic regression tests were used to analyse the data. The results showed that 82.32% of female respondents and 73.37% male respondents reported handwashing practice 8 times or more per day during COVID-19 pandemic. Participants who perceived themselves at higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 (OR 7.08, 2.26-22.17), had less negative perception toward the practice (OR 1.93, 1.32-2.82), perceived handwashing as an effective preventive measure (OR 1.77, 1.23-2.54), were female (OR 1.71, 1.21-2.41), perceived a more supportive norm (OR 1.68, 1.15-2.44) and noticed more barriers in access to handwashing facilities (OR 1.57, 1.05-2.36) were more likely to engage in hand hygiene practice more frequently during the pandemic. In conclusion, the majority of respondents did increase their frequency of hand hygiene practices during COVID-19 pandemic. In line with previous studies in other pandemic contexts, sex, perceived susceptibility and effectiveness are important predictors of hand hygiene practices, which are similar to findings from previous studies in other pandemic contexts. Addressing social norm related to the perceived hand hygiene practices of friends and important people is a potential health promotion strategy by creating hand hygiene norms in the community.","Dwipayanti NMU, Lubis DS, Harjana NPA",Front Public Health,2021,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
36746419,"Predisposing, Enabling, and Reinforcing Factors of COVID-19 Prevention Behavior in Indonesia: A Mixed-methods Study.","OBJECTIVES: To prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), behaviors such as mask-wearing, social distancing, decreasing mobility, and avoiding crowds have been suggested, especially in high-risk countries such as Indonesia. Unfortunately, the level of compliance with those practices has been low. This study was conducted to determine the predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors of COVID-19 prevention behavior in Indonesia. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used a mixed-methods approach. The participants were 264 adults from 21 provinces in Indonesia recruited through convenience sampling. Data were collected using a Google Form and in-depth interviews. Statistical analysis included univariate, bivariate, and multivariate logistic regression. Furthermore, qualitative data analysis was done through content analysis and qualitative data management using Atlas.ti software. RESULTS: Overall, 44.32% of respondents were non-compliant with recommended COVID-19 prevention behaviors. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, low-to-medium education level, poor attitude, insufficient involvement of leaders, and insufficient regulation were also associated with decreased community compliance. Based on in-depth interviews with informants, the negligence of the Indonesian government in the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to the unpreparedness of the community to face the pandemic, as people were not aware of the importance of preventive practices. CONCLUSIONS: Education level is not the only factor influencing community compliance with recommended COVID-19 prevention behaviors. Changing attitudes through health promotion to increase public awareness and encouraging voluntary community participation through active risk communication are necessary. Regulations and role leaders are also required to improve COVID-19 prevention behavior.","Lestari PW, Agestika L, Dewi GK",J Prev Med Public Health,2023 Jan,COVID-19 AND Indonesia

This study was conducted to assess the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on unfavorable clinical outcomes including hospitalization, severe COVID-19, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death using a real-world model. METHODS: This single-center retrospective cohort study involved patients with COVID-19 aged >/=18 years who presented to the COVID-19 emergency room at a secondary referral teaching hospital between June 1, 2021 and August 31, 2021. We used a binary logistic regression model to assess the effect of COVID-19 vaccination on unfavorable clinical outcomes, with age, sex, and comorbidities as confounding variables. RESULTS: A total of 716 patients were included, 32.1% of whom were vaccinated. The elderly participants (>/=65 years) had the lowest vaccine coverage among age groups. Vaccination had an effectiveness of 50% (95% confidence interval [CI], 25 to 66) for preventing hospitalization, 97% (95% CI, 77 to 99) for preventing severe COVID-19, 95% (95% CI, 56 to 99) for preventing ICU admission, and 90% (95% CI, 22 to 99) for preventing death. Interestingly, patients with type 2 diabetes had a 2-fold to 4-fold elevated risk of unfavorable outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Among adults, COVID-19 vaccination has a moderate preventive impact on hospitalization but a high preventive impact on severe COVID-19, ICU admission, and death. The authors suggest that relevant parties increase COVID-19 vaccination coverage, especially in the elderly population.","Rahadi DA, Yusri E, Putra SP, Semiarty R, Pertiwi D, Ilmiawati C",J Prev Med Public Health,2023 May,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
35189982,Household food security during the COVID-19 pandemic in urban and semi-urban areas in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: One of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic was the weakening of the community's economic condition. The weak economy of the community will have an impact on household food security. This study aims to determine food security in the COVID-19 pandemic situation and the impact of the pandemic on food security in urban and semi-urban areas. METHODS: A cross-sectional study with a total sample of 517 people who live in urban (Jakarta) and semi-urban (Depok) areas. The research data was collected online and purposively through Posyandu cadres who have access to family/community. Food security was measured using HFIAS (Household Food Insecurity Access Scale) method, while impact of COVID-19 pandemic was categorized into two categories: impacted (reduced income and laid off) and less impacted (not reduced income and laid off). Data analysis used the Chi-square test and multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: There were 65.0% of households with various level of food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the multivariate analysis showed that family income during the COVID-19 pandemic (AOR = 4.2; CI = 2.7-6.7), the type of impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e., reduced income and stopped working (AOR = 2.6; CI = 1.6-4.1), and the age of the respondent (AOR = 1.7; CI = 1.1-2.5) were significantly related to household food security during the pandemic after being controlled by husband's work status. Households with lower income had 4 times higher risk to experience food insecurity compared to those with higher income. Heavily impacted households (through reduced income and stopped working) had 3 times higher risk to experience food insecurity compared to those who did not. Additionally, we found that households with younger respondent (< 31 years old) had 2 times higher risk to experience food insecurity compared to those older counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic impacted household food security in both urban and semi-urban areas through worsening employment status and income condition.","Syafiq A, Fikawati S, Gemily SC",J Health Popul Nutr,2022 Feb 21,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
35871712,Oral antiviral treatments for COVID-19: opportunities and challenges.,"The use of antiviral COVID-19 medications can successfully inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication and prevent disease progression to a more severe form. However, the timing of antiviral treatment plays a crucial role in this regard. Oral antiviral drugs provide an opportunity to manage SARS-CoV-2 infection without a need for hospital admission, easing the general burden that COVID-19 can have on the healthcare system. This review paper (i) presents the potential pharmaceutical antiviral targets, including various host-based targets and viral-based targets, (ii) characterizes the first-generation anti-SARS-CoV-2 oral drugs (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and molnupiravir), (iii) summarizes the clinical progress of other oral antivirals for use in COVID-19, (iv) discusses ethical issues in such clinical trials and (v) presents challenges associated with the use of oral antivirals in clinical practice. Oral COVID-19 antivirals represent a part of the strategy to adapt to long-term co-existence with SARS-CoV-2 in a manner that prevents healthcare from being overwhelmed. It is pivotal to ensure equal and fair global access to the currently available oral antivirals and those authorized in the future.","Rahmah L, Abarikwu SO, Arero AG, Essouma M, Jibril AT, Fal A, Flisiak R, Makuku R, Marquez L, Mohamed K, Ndow L, Zarebska-Michaluk D, Rezaei N, Rzymski P",Pharmacol Rep,2022 Dec,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
35818655,COVID-19 Pandemic-to-Endemic Transition in Indonesia: What Does the Future Hold?,"Since first reported in December 2019, SARS-2 Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection has become a world-class pandemic, overwhelming every aspect of the global system. Globally, 526 billion confirmed cases with 6,3 billion death cases were reported by World Health Organization (WHO) by 31 May 2022. In that period, Indonesia has reported 6 billion confirmed cases with a case fatality rate reaching 2.58%. The number of new weekly cases and new weekly death have continued the declining trend observed since its peak in January 2022, i.e. 3% decrease of new weekly cases and 11% decrease of new weekly death as compared to the previous week. In response to the current epidemiology improvement, countries including Indonesia have relaxed some regulations on COVID-19 as the preparation for pandemic-to-endemic transition.Endemic is not equal to harmless. Commonly, endemic is falsely interpreted as the end of COVID-19, bringing to a false complacency. Endemic ""label"" on an infectious disease, such as malaria, HIV infection, tuberculosis in certain regions of the world, means the overall rates of infection are static - neither rising nor falling. Endemic ""label"" defines nothing about time duration to reach disease end or how many populations will still be susceptible to the disease. Therefore, transition for pandemic-to-endemic of COVID-19 could not simply translated into the end of either public and health service awareness, or research on COVID-19. It then should add new emerging perspective on COVID-19 research as was mandated by WHO. One example of which is evidence-based strategies for infection prevention control and personal protective equipment for infection control de-escalation in relation to COVID-19 pandemic scaling back.In the spirit of nurturing research and publication in this transition for pandemic-to-endemic era, the Indonesian Journal of Internal Medicine published various COVID-19 associated-original articles, systematic review, and case series across various COVID-19 condition. Atici, et. al. and Tunjungputri, et. al. report articles on factors and treatment that is associated with higher COVID-19 survival. Corticosteroids, Interleukin-6 inhibitors and anticoagulant administered to the proper subset of COVID-19 population are several beneficial treatments among limited evidence-based proven treatment available today. These supportive treatments, whenever indicated at the proper time, should be considered in managing every COVID-19 patient. In addition, high antibiotic use in COVID-19 patients despite low secondary bacterial infection has been widely reported. Chen, et. al. report a similar situation in Indonesia and should raise the awareness of antimicrobial resistance thread now and in the future. Together with proper diagnostic stewardship, the simple predictors of secondary bacterial infection that have been concluded could potentially be used to reduce liberal antibiotic use while optimizing the use in indicated patients. Prabowo, et al. enriched our understanding on usage of telemedicine to monitor post COVID-19 condition in Indonesian populations.High quality research has, and will again, save the livelihoods of people across the world. While future pandemics could not be completely prevented, the research infrastructures that have built during last 2 years could be used as a strong modality to be better prepared and coordinated in future outbreak/ pandemic response by detecting and preventing the emerging diseases at their very early stage. Waste in COVID-19 research and multiple COVID-19 associated research article retractions should caution researchers -as evidence-producer- and clinicians -as evidence-user- in prioritizing the scientific inquiry and questioning individual conflict of interest. Insightful articles addressing the multitude aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic-to-endemic transition related topics are still needed in the future.",Sinto R,Acta Med Indones,2022 Apr,COVID-19 AND Indonesia

METHODS: We employed a case-control study design, utilizing secondary data from the Epidemiology Surveillance, Immunization Prevention, and Disease Control Sections of the DKI Jakarta Provincial Health Office, collected from December 2020 to January 2021. The study included 188 cases and an equal number of controls. Cases were COVID-19 patients confirmed to have died, as reported by hospitals and communities and subsequently verified by healthcare workers. Control subjects were patients who completed a 14-day isolation period and had been officially declared recovered by healthcare professionals. The dependent variable was the mortality of COVID-19 patients in the January 2021 period. The independent variables consisted of demographic data (age and sex), clinical symptoms (cough, runny nose, anosmia, diarrhea, headaches, abdominal pain, muscle pain, and nausea/vomiting), and comorbidities (hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes). Multivariate analysis was conducted using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: The multiple logistic regression analysis revealed several factors associated with COVID-19 fatalities in Jakarta: age of 60 years or older (odds ratio [OR], 4.84; 95% CI, 3.00 to 7.80), male (OR, 2.38; 95% CI, 2.41 to 3.68), dyspnea (OR, 3.93; 95% CI, 2.04 to 7.55), anosmia (OR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.46), and heart disease (OR, 4.38; 95% CI, 1.04 to 18.46).

However, the implementation of vaccination varies greatly across countries, with the developing countries lagging behind. This study investigates Indonesia's vaccination experiences, challenges, and acceleration over the course of implementation period. This study provides simulations to estimate the vaccination rate using time-series forecasting machine learning. We use Administrative data and Survey results in our analysis. Our findings suggest limited vaccine availability had caused low-coverage vaccination implementation in the early stage of vaccination implementation period. However, following the increased availability of vaccine, the vaccination rate accelerates up to 600% times. The government of Indonesia utilized strategic public places, public and private offices, and engaging private sectors in the phase two implementation to accelerate the vaccination implementation. Indonesia might reach 63.1 million individuals vaccinated at the end of March 2022, or 35% of the targeted population with up to April 2021 vaccination rate. To accelerate, government introduced a number of new strategies including door-to-door persuasion through neighborhood association (RT), educating individuals, and providing transportation from their home to the vaccination facility. We expect new strategies could further improve vaccination speed by around 1.4 million to 3.5 million individuals per day.","Arifin B, Anas T",Hum Vaccin Immunother,2021 Nov 2,COVID-19 AND Indonesia

Even though COVID-19 as global health emergency has been declared end, research in finding and evaluating modalities that can decrease severity and mortality from COVID-19 infection are still on going.Until now, there have been more than 380,000 publications in Pubmed with search term ""COVID 19"". Excessive inflammatory activation is an important part of COVID-19 pathogenesis which can be caused by interactions of the virus with the host and modulation of host immune response.2 Better understanding on COVID-19 pathogenesis could improve the strategies to manage COVID-19 infection.  Monoclonal antibody is one treatment modality that can be used to target the virus itself or modulate dysregulated immune response in COVID-19.  Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can halt progression of COVID-19 in high-risk patients. However, considering the limited production and high cost, is this treatment modality an option in Indonesia?Many things have been learned from this pandemic and can be a lesson for preparing the next pandemic or other emerging diseases. Various therapeutic developments to treat COVID-19 have been studied for hospitalized patients and outpatient setting, one of which is the use of variety monoclonal antibodies that showed overall moderate efficacy in decreasing severity and mortality from COVID-19 infection and also good safety. Unfortunately, besides variable efficacy across variants, the cost for monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) are still high which make the access for this treatment options for managing COVID-19 might be limited in low to middle income countries.

However, COVID-19 new cases continued to increase, and there remain uncertainties as to the future trajectory. We aimed to investigate how medical and health academics view the Indonesian government's handling of COVID-19 and which areas of health systems need to be prioritized to improve the government's response to COVID-19. We conducted a modified Delphi study adapting the COVID-19 assessment scorecard (COVID-SCORE) as the measurement criteria. We invited medical and health academics from ten universities across Indonesia to take part in the two-round Delphi study. In the first round, participants were presented with 20 statements of COVID-SCORE and asked to rate their agreement with each statement using a five-point Likert scale. All participants who completed the first cycle were invited to participate in the second cycle. They had the opportunity to revise their answers based on the previous cycle's results and ranked a list of actions to improve government response. We achieved a moderate consensus level for five statements, a low consensus level for 13 statements and no consensus for two statements. The prioritization suggested that top priorities for improving the government's response to COVID-19 in Indonesia encompass: (1) strengthening capacity to ensure consistent, credible and targeted communication while adopting a more inclusive and empathic communication style to address public concerns; (2) ensuring universal access to reliable COVID-19 testing by expanding lab infrastructure, facilitating operational readiness, and scaling up implementation of proven alternative/complementary tests to RT-PCR; and (3) boosting contact tracing implementation capacity and facilitating contact tracing for all positive cases, involving key stakeholders in further development of the existing contact tracing system (i.e. PeduliLindungi) as well as its evaluation and quality assurance.

We undertook an online survey to measure the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a COVID-19 vaccine and its determinants in Indonesia. The WTP was assessed using a simple dichotomous contingent valuation approach and a linear regression model was used to assess its associated determinants. There were 1,359 respondents who completed the survey. In total, 78.3% (1,065) were willing to pay for the COVID-19 vaccine with a mean and median WTP of US$ 57.20 (95%CI: US$ 54.56, US$ 59.85) and US$ 30.94 (95%CI: US$ 30.94, US$ 30.94), respectively. Being a health-care worker, having a high income, and having high perceived risk were associated with higher WTP. These findings suggest that the WTP for a COVID-19 vaccine is relatively high in Indonesia. This WTP information can be used to construct a payment model for a COVID-19 vaccine in the country. Nevertheless, to attain higher vaccine coverage, it may be necessary to partially subsidize the vaccine for those who are less wealthy and to design health promotion materials to increase the perceived risk for COVID-19 in the country.","Harapan H, Wagner AL, Yufika A, Winardi W, Anwar S, Gan AK, Setiawan AM, Rajamoorthy Y, Sofyan H, Vo TQ, Hadisoemarto PF, Muller R, Groneberg DA, Mudatsir M",Hum Vaccin Immunother,2020 Dec 1,COVID-19 AND Indonesia

Socio-demographics characteristics, social interaction history, information-seeking behavior, as well as knowledge, attitude, and practice toward COVID-19 were collected through a self-reported questionnaire. A p-value of <0.05 indicated statistical significance. RESULTS: Out of 4870 respondents, 64.9% had positive attitude and 51.5% had positive practice toward COVID-19, while only 29.8% had adequate knowledge. Knowledge was slightly positively correlated with attitude and practice (rho = 0.074 and rho = 0.054, respectively; both p<0.001), while attitude was weakly correlated with practice (rho = 0.234, p<0.001). Several factors including age, sex, place of residence, institution type, academic level, family income, history of chronic illness, prior volunteering experience, and perceptual awareness on COVID-19 were significantly associated with either knowledge, attitude, and/or practice toward COVID-19. Furthermore, health institution's and the government's press releases, as well as health expert opinions were deemed as the most reliable sources of COVID-19-related information-yet trivially none of these sources were associated with knowledge, attitude, and practice in the study population. CONCLUSION: Many undergraduate medical students in Indonesia had positive attitude and practice against COVID-19, yet only a few had adequate knowledge. This warrants further interventions to keep them updated with COVID-19 evidence to maximize their potentials in raising public awareness on COVID-19.","Adli I, Widyahening IS, Lazarus G, Phowira J, Baihaqi LA, Ariffandi B, Putera AM, Nugraha D, Gamalliel N, Findyartini A",PLoS One,2022,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
35341058,The dynamics of circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Bogor and surrounding areas reflect variant shifting during the first and second waves of COVID-19 in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Indonesia is one of the Southeast Asian countries with high case numbers of COVID-19 with up to 4.2 million confirmed cases by 29 October 2021. Understanding the genome of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for delivering public health intervention as certain variants may have different attributes that can potentially affect their transmissibility, as well as the performance of diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the dynamics of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants over a 15-month period in Bogor and its surrounding areas in correlation with the first and second wave of COVID-19 in Indonesia. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples collected from suspected patients from Bogor, Jakarta and Tangerang were confirmed for SARS-CoV-2 infection with RT-PCR. RNA samples of those confirmed patients were subjected to whole genome sequencing using the ARTIC Network protocol and sequencer platform from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). RESULTS: We successfully identified 16 lineages and six clades out of 202 samples (male n = 116, female n = 86). Genome analysis revealed that Indonesian lineage B.1.466.2 dominated during the first wave (n = 48, 23.8%) while Delta variants (AY.23, AY.24, AY.39, AY.42, AY.43 dan AY.79) were dominant during the second wave (n = 53, 26.2%) following the highest number of confirmed cases in Indonesia. In the spike protein gene, S_D614G and S_P681R changes were dominant in both B.1.466.2 and Delta variants, while N439K was only observed in B.1.466.2 (n = 44) and B.1.470 (n = 1). Additionally, the S_T19R, S_E156G, S_F157del, S_R158del, S_L452R, S_T478K, S_D950N and S_V1264L changes were only detected in Delta variants, consistent with those changes being characteristic of Delta variants in general. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a shift in SARS-CoV-2 variants from the first wave of COVID-19 to Delta variants in the second wave, during which the number of confirmed cases surpassed those in the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. Higher proportion of unique mutations detected in Delta variants compared to the first wave variants indicated potential mutational effects on viral transmissibility that correlated with a higher incidence of confirmed cases. Genomic surveillance of circulating variants, especially those with higher transmissibility, should be continuously conducted to rapidly inform decision making and support outbreak preparedness, prevention, and public health response.","Prasetyoputri A, Dharmayanthi AB, Iryanto SB, Andriani A, Nuryana I, Wardiana A, Ridwanuloh AM, Swasthikawati S, Hariyatun H, Nugroho HA, Idris I, Indriawati I, Noviana Z, Oktavia L, Yuliawati Y, Masrukhin M, Hasrianda EF, Sukmarini L, Fahrurrozi F, Yanthi ND, Fathurahman AT, Wulandari AS, Setiawan R, Rizal S, Fathoni A, Kusharyoto W, Lisdiyanti P, Ningrum RA, Saputra S",PeerJ,2022,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
36755476,Evaluation of Health-Related Quality of Life and Mental Health in 729 Medical Students in Indonesia During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"BACKGROUND The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and mental health worldwide. However, its impact on medical students in Indonesia has not been well documented. This study aimed to evaluate HRQoL and mental health in 729 Indonesian medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study from 31 August to 30 September 2021. The study instrument was an online questionnaire that was distributed via social media platforms. The 12-item short form version 2 (SF12v2) was used to measure HRQoL, and the 21-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) was used to measure mental health. RESULTS From 729 Indonesian medical students included in the analyses, 37.3% had impaired physical component and 66.9% had impaired mental component of HRQoL. The determinants were medical students' island of residence, history of hospitalization, and family member's hospitalization and death due to COVID-19. Concerning mental health, the prevalence of reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress were 45.4%, 65.2%, and 60.9%, respectively. Sex, study method, grade, previous COVID-19 disease severity, comorbidities, previous learning experience, and history of family isolation were identified as the determinants of mental health. CONCLUSIONS This study highlights the adverse effects of COVID-19 on HRQoL and mental health in Indonesian medical students. The results identified key associations, including SARS-CoV-2 infection and comorbidities experienced by the students, the health of their families, including grief following bereavement, and the effects of social isolation during the pandemic.","Nugraha D, Salamah S, Luke K, Wibowo ZK, Witarto AP, Deswima C, Kloping NA, Witarto BS, Syamlan AT, Irzaldy A, Rochmanti M, Sari DR, Sakina S, Alkaff FF",Med Sci Monit,2023 Feb 9,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
35332616,Values and preferences of the general population in Indonesia in relation to rapid COVID-19 antigen self-tests: A cross-sectional survey.,"OBJECTIVES: Home diagnostics are essential to assist members of the general population become active agents of case detection. In Indonesia, a country with an over-burdened healthcare system, individuals could use rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests to self-detect COVID-19. To assess the general population's values and attitudes towards SARS-CoV-2 self-testing, a survey was conducted in mid-2021 in Jakarta and the provinces of Banten and North Sulawesi. METHODS: This was a quantitative survey that approached respondents in >600 randomly selected street-points in the three study geographies in July-August 2021. A 35-item questionnaire was used to collect data on key variables, such as likelihood to use a SARS-CoV-2 self-test, willingness to pay for a self-test device, and likely actions following a positive self-test result. Bivariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of 630 respondents (318 were female), 15.53% knew about COVID-19 self-testing, while 62.70% agreed with the idea of people being able to self-test at home, unassisted, for COVID-19. If self-tests were available in Indonesia, >60% of respondents would use them if they felt it necessary and would undertake regular self-testing for example weekly if recommended. Upon receiving a positive self-test result, most respondents would communicate it (86.03%), request post-test counselling (80.79%), self-isolate (97.46%), and/or warn their close contacts (90.48%). CONCLUSIONS: The use of rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection tests for self-testing appears acceptable to a majority of the Indonesian public, to learn whether they have COVID-19. Self-testing should be prioritised to complement to an over-burdened healthcare system by helping the public, asymptomatic individuals included, become agents of change in epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in their communities.","Thomas C, Shilton S, Thomas C, Batheja D, Goel S, Mone Iye C, Ivanova E, Martinez-Perez GZ",Trop Med Int Health,2022 May,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
36584099,"Post-COVID depression and its multiple factors, does Favipiravir have a protective effect? A longitudinal study of indonesia COVID-19 patients.","BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) not only has a long-term effect on its survivors, it also affects their quality of life, including inducing depression as a possible manifestation of central nervous system disruption. Favipiravir shows promising efficacy as an antiviral drug for the treatment of COVID-19. However, its effect on the sequelae of COVID-19 has not been explored. Therefore, this study aims to assess the impact of Favipiravir and address the factors associated with post-COVID depression in Indonesia. METHOD: This cohort study conducted a post-COVID-19 survey on Indonesian patients who were diagnosed by using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and antigen tests until January 2022. An online questionnaire was distributed to obtain information on demographics, comorbidities, health behavior, symptoms, and treatment. The propensity technique was used to allocate the participants into the favipiravir and nonrecipient groups (1:1). The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used for outcome measurement. The cohort was followed up biweekly for 60 days after onset/diagnosis to determine the occurrence of depression. Cox regression analysis with an adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval was used to estimate the effect of favipiravir on post-COVID-19 depression. RESULTS: The data included the information of 712 participants, of whom 18.54% had depression within 60 days after onset/diagnosis. Depression was higher in the nonrecipient group (21.06%) than in the favipiravir group (16.01%). After adjustment by other factors, favipiravir prescription was found to be associated with depression (aOR 0.488, 95% CI 0.339-0.701 p < 0.001). In accordance with the PHQ-9 subset, favipiravir exerted a significant protective effect against depressive mood and loss of interest. However, patients living alone were prone to experiencing loss of interest (aOR 2.253, 95% CI 1.329-3.818, p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: The data obtained in this preliminary survey suggested that favipiravir may be useful for preventing post-COVID depression. However, further study is needed. Moreover, the provision of mental health support, particularly to those who live alone, must be ensured.

36777784,"Understanding COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy: A cross-sectional study in Malang District, Indonesia.","INTRODUCTION: Vaccine hesitancy could undermine efforts to reduce incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Understanding COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is crucial to tailoring strategies to increase vaccination acceptance. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of and the reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Malang District, Indonesia. METHODS: Data come from a cross-sectional study among individuals aged 17-85 years old (N = 3,014). Multivariate ordered logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with postponing or refusing COVID-19 vaccines. The Oxford COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy scale was used to measure vaccine hesitancy. A wide range of reasons for hesitancy, including coronavirus vaccine confidence and complacency, vaccination knowledge, trust and attitude in health workers and health providers, coronavirus conspiracy, anger reaction and need for chaos, populist views, lifestyle, and religious influence, was examined. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results show that 60.2% of the respondents were hesitant to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Low confidence and complacency beliefs about the vaccine (OR = 1.229, 95% CI = 1.195-1.264) and more general sources of mistrust within the community, particularly regarding health providers (OR = 1.064, 95% CI = 1.026-1.102) and vaccine developers (OR = 1.054, 95% CI = 1.027-1.082), are associated with higher levels of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine hesitancy is also associated with anger reactions (OR = 1.019, 95% CI = 0.998-1.040), need for chaos (OR = 1.044, 95% CI = 1.022-1.067), and populist views (OR = 1.028, 95% CI = 1.00-1.056). The findings were adjusted for socio-demographic factors, including age, sex, education, marital status, working status, type of family, household income, religious beliefs, and residency. The results suggest the need for an effective health promotion program to improve community knowledge of the COVID-19 vaccine, while effective strategies to tackle ""infodemics"" are needed to address hesitancy during a new vaccine introduction program.","Sujarwoto, Maharani A, Holipah, Andarini S, Saputri RAM, Pakpahan E, Oceandy D, Tampubolon G",Front Public Health,2022,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
37479557,"Path analysis of COVID-19 vaccine adherence among adolescents across Indonesia, in the Maluku-Papua Islands (Eastern Indonesia), and on Java Island.","BACKGROUND: COVID-19 incidence in Indonesia was high among adolescents, but vaccine acceptance remains low. The unequal geographical distribution of the health workforce and health facilities in Indonesia, including a lower number of health workers and facilities in Maluku-Papua, resulted in a low rate of vaccine acceptance. Knowledge, attitude, belief in the vaccine, comorbidity, congenital status are related to vaccine adherence, but mediation analysis of factors remains lacking. We aimed to analyze path analysis of knowledge, congenital, comorbidity, belief, and attitude to COVID-19 vaccine adherence among adolescents in Indonesia, Maluku-Papua Island, and Java Island. METHOD: A nationwide cross-sectional study was undertaken among 7604 adolescents. A path analysis to investigate mediating effects between variables combined with bootstrapping was utilized to determine statistical significance. RESULT: Knowledge, congenital status, comorbidity, belief, and attitude were significantly positively associated with COVID-19 vaccine adherence among adolescents in Maluku-Papua Island (p < 0.01; n = 4761), Java Island (p < 0.01; n = 1573), and Indonesia (p < 0.05; n = 7604). Congenital status, belief, and attitude negatively mediated the relationship between knowledge of and adherence to COVID-19 vaccine (p < 0.01) in Indonesia and among the subgroup on Maluku-Papua Island (p < 0.01), but a positive mediation (p = 0.04) in our subgroup analysis of Java Island. Comorbidity status, belief, and attitude negatively mediated relationship between knowledge and adherence to COVID-19 vaccine in Indonesia (p </=0.01) and Maluku-Papua (p = 0.00), but no mediation role was found in Java Island (p = 0.58). CONCLUSION: Comorbidity, congenital illness status, belief in and attitude to COVID-19 vaccine negatively mediated the relationship between knowledge of and adherence to COVID-19 vaccine among adolescents in Indonesia and our sub-group on Maluku-Papua Island but not on Java Island. PRACTICAL IMPLICATION: Massive improvement in healthcare facility equality plays an important role in Indonesia gaining COVID-19 vaccine adherence.","Efendi D, Kurniasari MD, Tsai HT, Wanda D, Nurhaeni N, Efendi F",J Pediatr Nurs,2023 Nov-Dec,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
38367758,Maternal vaccination against COVID-19 and neonatal outcomes during Omicron: INTERCOVID-2022 study.,"BACKGROUND: In early 2023, when Omicron was the variant of concern, we showed that vaccinating pregnant women decreased the risk for severe COVID-19-related complications and maternal morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze the impact of COVID-19 during pregnancy on newborns and the effects of maternal COVID-19 vaccination on neonatal outcomes when Omicron was the variant of concern. STUDY DESIGN: INTERCOVID-2022 was a large, prospective, observational study, conducted in 40 hospitals across 18 countries, from November 27, 2021 (the day after the World Health Organization declared Omicron the variant of concern) to June 30, 2022, to assess the effect of COVID-19 in pregnancy on maternal and neonatal outcomes and to assess vaccine effectiveness. Women diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 during pregnancy were compared with 2 nondiagnosed, unmatched women recruited concomitantly and consecutively during pregnancy or at delivery. Mother-newborn dyads were followed until hospital discharge. The primary outcomes were a neonatal positive test for COVID-19, severe neonatal morbidity index, severe perinatal morbidity and mortality index, preterm birth, neonatal death, referral to neonatal intensive care unit, and diseases during the neonatal period. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated with adjustment for maternal risk profile. RESULTS: We enrolled 4707 neonates born to 1577 (33.5%) mothers diagnosed with COVID-19 and 3130 (66.5%) nondiagnosed mothers. Among the diagnosed mothers, 642 (40.7%) were not vaccinated, 147 (9.3%) were partially vaccinated, 551 (34.9%) were completely vaccinated, and 237 (15.0%) also had a booster vaccine. Neonates of booster-vaccinated mothers had less than half (relative risk, 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.91) the risk of being diagnosed with COVID-19 when compared with those of unvaccinated mothers; they also had the lowest rates of preterm birth, medically indicated preterm birth, respiratory distress syndrome, and number of days in the neonatal intensive care unit. Newborns of unvaccinated mothers had double the risk for neonatal death (relative risk, 2.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-4.00) when compared with those of nondiagnosed mothers. Vaccination was not associated with any congenital malformations. Although all vaccines provided protection against neonatal test positivity, newborns of booster-vaccinated mothers had the highest vaccine effectiveness (64%; 95% confidence interval, 10%-86%). Vaccine effectiveness was not as high for messenger RNA vaccines only. Vaccine effectiveness against moderate or severe neonatal outcomes was much lower, namely 13% in the booster-vaccinated group (all vaccines) and 25% and 28% in the completely and booster-vaccinated groups, respectively (messenger RNA vaccines only). Vaccines were fairly effective in protecting neonates when given to pregnant women </=100 days (14 weeks) before birth; thereafter, the risk increased and was much higher after 200 days (29 weeks). Finally, none of the neonatal practices studied, including skin-to-skin contact and direct breastfeeding, increased the risk for infecting newborns. CONCLUSION: When Omicron was the variant of concern, newborns of unvaccinated mothers had an increased risk for neonatal death. Neonates of vaccinated mothers had a decreased risk for preterm birth and adverse neonatal outcomes. Because the protective effect of COVID-19 vaccination decreases with time, to ensure that newborns are maximally protected against COVID-19, mothers should receive a vaccine or booster dose no more than 14 weeks before the expected date of delivery.","Barros FC, Gunier RB, Rego A, Sentilhes L, Rauch S, Gandino S, Teji JS, Thornton JG, Kachikis AB, Nieto R, Craik R, Cavoretto PI, Winsey A, Roggero P, Rodriguez GB, Savasi V, Kalafat E, Giuliani F, Fabre M, Benski AC, Coronado-Zarco IA, Livio S, Ostrovska A, Maiz N, Castedo Camacho FR, Peterson A, Deruelle P, Giudice C, Casale RA, Salomon LJ, Soto Conti CP, Prefumo F, Mohamed Elbayoumy EZ, Vale M, Hernandez V, Chandler K, Risso M, Marler E, Caceres DM, Crespo GA, Ernawati E, Lipschuetz M, Ariff S, Takahashi K, Vecchiarelli C, Hubka T, Ikenoue S, Tavchioska G, Bako B, Ayede AI, Eskenazi B, Bhutta ZA, Kennedy SH, Papageorghiou AT, Villar J",Am J Obstet Gynecol,2024 Oct,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
35396304,Mental health and health-related quality of life among healthcare workers in Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study.,"OBJECTIVES: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are the front lines during the COVID-19 pandemic. They are more exposed to COVID-19 than other professions. Studies from other countries have shown that the mental health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of HCWs were affected during this pandemic. However, studies on mental health in Indonesia remain scarce and no study has evaluated the HRQoL among HCWs. Thus, this study was designed to explore the mental health status and HRQoL among HCWs in Indonesia. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study. SETTING: This was an open online survey in Indonesia conducted from December 2020 to February 2021. PARTICIPANTS: This study involved HCWs who worked during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the 502 respondents who accessed the online questionnaire, 392 were included in the analysis. OUTCOMES: Mental health status was measured using the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale and HRQoL was measured using the second version of the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF12v2). RESULTS: The prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress among HCWs was 29.4%, 44.9% and 31.8%, respectively. Using the SF12v2 questionnaire, 354 (90.3%) HCWs were found to have impaired physical component and 156 (39.8%) HCWs have impaired mental component. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of mental health problems among HCWs was high in Indonesia. HRQoL, particularly the physical component, was affected in most HCWs. Thus, policymakers should give more attention to the mental health and HRQoL of HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Syamlan AT, Salamah S, Alkaff FF, Prayudi YE, Kamil M, Irzaldy A, Karimah A, Postma MJ, Purba FD, Arifin B",BMJ Open,2022 Apr 8,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
37351094,"Is knowledge about COVID-19 associated with willingness to receive vaccine, vaccine uptake, and vaccine booster uptake in rural Malang, Indonesia?","BACKGROUND: Lack of knowledge regarding the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and COVID-19 vaccines is a key barrier to COVID-19 vaccine uptake in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). AIMS: To examine factors associated with knowledge about COVID-19 and the association between knowledge of COVID-19, willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, and vaccine uptake in Malang, East Java, Indonesia. METHOD: A cross-sectional study among individuals aged 15-99 years was conducted in Malang, Java Timur, Indonesia between November 2022 and January 2023. Of 10,050 potential respondents, 10,007 were able to complete the survey. The main independent variable was knowledge about COVID-19, which was assessed using a six-item questionnaire. The dependent variables were COVID-19 vaccine uptake and COVID-19 booster vaccine uptake. The mediating variable was respondent's willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Linear regression was used to examine factors associated with knowledge about COVID-19. Logistic regression was employed to examine the association of knowledge about COVID-19 with vaccine uptake. Generalized structural equation modeling (GSEM) was performed to examine whether willingness to receive a vaccine mediated the association between knowledge about COVID-19 and vaccination uptake. FINDINGS: The percentage of respondents who reported having received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine was 94.8%, while the percentage of those who reported having received at least three doses was 88.5%. These numbers are higher than the national average for COVID-19 vaccine and booster vaccine uptake. Most respondents answered about four of six knowledge items correctly (M = 4.60, SD = 1.1). Among respondents who had not received a vaccine, 83.1% expressed willingness to receive a vaccine when it became available to them. Older, more educated, employed respondents, and those with higher economic status, demonstrated more accurate knowledge about COVID-19 than younger, less educated, unemployed respondents and those with lower economic status. Respondents who demonstrated more accurate knowledge about COVID-19 were more likely to have received a vaccine (OR = 1.528, 95% CI = 1.428-1.634) and a booster vaccine (OR = 1.260, 95% CI = 1.196-1.328). Willingness to receive a vaccine mediated the association between knowledge about COVID-19 and vaccine uptake (coef. = 0.426, 95% CI = 0.379-0.473). IMPLICATIONS: Interventions and public health programs aiming to improve knowledge about COVID-19 can be implemented to improve individual willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination and to improve COVID-19 vaccine uptake among the general population.","Sujarwoto S, Maharani A",Front Public Health,2023,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
36129894,"What message appeal and messenger are most persuasive for COVID-19 vaccine uptake: Results from a 5-country survey in India, Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, and Ukraine.","Effective strategies to encourage COVID-19 vaccination should consider how health communication can be tailored to specific contexts. Our study aimed to evaluate the influence of three specific messaging appeals from two kinds of messengers on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in diverse countries. We surveyed 953 online participants in five countries (India, Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, and Ukraine). We assessed participants' perceptions of three messaging appeals of vaccination-COVID-19 disease health outcomes, social norms related to COVID-19 vaccination, and economic impact of COVID-19-from two messengers, healthcare providers (HCP), and peers. We examined participants' ad preference and vaccine hesitancy using multivariable multinomial logistic regression. Participants expressed a high level of approval for all the ads. The healthcare outcome-healthcare provider ad was most preferred among participants from India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Ukraine. Participants in Kenya reported a preference for the health outcome-peer ad. The majority of participants in each country expressed high levels of vaccine hesitancy. However, in a final logistic regression model participant characteristics were not significantly related to vaccine hesitancy. These findings suggest that appeals related to health outcomes, economic benefit, and social norms are all acceptable to diverse general populations, while specific audience segments (i.e., mothers, younger adults, etc.) may have preferences for specific appeals over others. Tailored approaches, or approaches that are developed with the target audience's concerns and preferences in mind, will be more effective than broad-based or mass appeals.","Limaye RJ, Balgobin K, Michel A, Schulz G, Erchick DJ",PLoS One,2022,COVID-19 AND Indonesia

33762053,Stigma Associated with COVID-19 Among Health Care Workers in Indonesia.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the stigma associated with coronavirus disease - 2019 (COVID-19) among health care workers (HCWs) in Indonesia during the early phase of the pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 12 hospitals across the country in March, 2020. A logistic regression was employed to assess the association between stigma and explanatory variables. RESULTS: In total, 288 HCWs were surveyed, of which 93.4% had never experienced any outbreaks. Approximately 21.9% of the respondents had stigma associated with COVID-19. HCWs who were doctors, had not participated in trainings related to COVID-19, worked in the capital of the province, worked at private hospitals, or worked at a hospital with COVID-19 triage protocols were likely to have no stigma associated with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The stigma associated with COVID-19 is relatively high among HCWs in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. Adequate dissemination of knowledge and adequate protection are necessary to reduce stigma among HCWs.","Yufika A, Pratama R, Anwar S, Winardi W, Librianty N, Prashanti NAP, Sari TNW, Utomo PS, Dwiamelia T, Natha PPC, Salwiyadi S, Asrizal FW, Ikram I, Wulandari I, Haryanto S, Fenobilire N, Wagner AL, Jamil KF, Mudatsir M, Harapan H",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,2022 Oct,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
37807699,Increased risk of poor clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus and in-hospital mortality predictors: A retrospective cohort from a tertiary hospital in Indonesia.,"AIM: To determine association between diabetes in confirmed cases of COVID-19 and intensive care admission and in-hospital mortality, evaluate several laboratory parameters as mortality predictor and develop predictors of in-hospital mortality among diabetics with COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective cohort recruited all cases of COVID-19 hospitalized in Fatmawati General Hospital from March to October 2020. Inclusion criterion was RT-PCR confirmed cases of COVID-19 who aged 18 years and older while exclusion criteria were incomplete medical record or cannot be found and pregnant women. RESULTS: We enrolled 506 participants to this study with median age of 51 years (IQR:22), female (56.32%), and diabetes (28.46%). Diabetes increased intensive care admission (adjusted OR: 2.57; 95% CI: 3.52-10.43) and in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR: 2.50; 95% CI: 1.61-3.89). In predicting in-hospital mortality, ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase offered an acceptable discrimination, AUC: 0.71 (95% CI: 0.62-0.79) and AUC: 0.70 (95% CI: 0.61-0.78), respectively. The optimal cut-off of predicting mortality for ferritin was 786 g/mL and for LDH was 514.94 u/L. Factors include age above 70 years old, RBGs level on admission above 250 mg/dL or below 140 mg/dL, ferritin level above 786 ng/mL and presence of ARDS increased the odds of mortality among individuals with diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes increases risk intensive care admission and in hospital mortality in COVID-19. Multivariate analysis showed that older age, RBG on admission, high ferritin level, presence of ARDS increased the odds of mortality among individuals with diabetes.","Mokoagow MI, Harbuwono DS, Kshanti IA, Rumende CM, Subekti I, Harimurti K, Chen K, Shatri H",Endocrinol Diabetes Metab,2023 Nov,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
38968247,Hospital services utilisation and cost before and after COVID-19 hospital treatment: Evidence from Indonesia.,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate hospital services utilisation and cost among the Indonesian population enrolled in the National Health Insurance (NHI) program before and after COVID-19 hospital treatment. METHODS: 28,159 Indonesian NHI enrolees treated with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in hospitals between May and August 2020 were compared to 8,995 individuals never diagnosed with COVID-19 in 2020. A difference-in-difference approach is used to contrast the monthly all-cause utilisation rate and total claims of hospital services between these two groups. A period of nine months before and three to six months after hospital treatment were included in the analysis. RESULTS: A substantial short-term increase in hospital services utilisation and cost before and after COVID-19 treatment was observed. Using the fifth month before treatment as the reference period, we observed an increased outpatient visits rate in 1-3 calendar months before and up to 2-4 months after treatment (p<0.001) among the COVID-19 group compared to the comparison group. We also found a higher admissions rate in 1-2 months before and one month after treatment (p<0.001). Consequently, increased hospital costs were observed in 1-3 calendar months before and 1-4 calendar months after the treatment (p<0.001). The elevated hospital resource utilisation was more prominent among individuals older than 40. Overall, no substantial increase in hospital outpatient visits, admissions, and costs beyond four months after and five months before COVID-19 treatment. CONCLUSION: Individuals with COVID-19 who required hospital treatment had considerably higher healthcare resource utilisation in the short-term, before and after the treatment. These findings indicated that the total cost of treating COVID-19 patients might include the pre- and post-acute period.","Rizal MF, Hafidz F, Kusila GR, Aisyiah W, Revelino D, Dhanalvin E, Oktavia A, Ilyasa, Jaya C, Saut B, Ruby M",PLoS One,2024,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
35507481,Efficacy and Safety of the RBD-Dimer-Based Covid-19 Vaccine ZF2001 in Adults.,"BACKGROUND: The ZF2001 vaccine, which contains a dimeric form of the receptor-binding domain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and aluminum hydroxide as an adjuvant, was shown to be safe, with an acceptable side-effect profile, and immunogenic in adults in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial to investigate the efficacy and confirm the safety of ZF2001. The trial was performed at 31 clinical centers across Uzbekistan, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Ecuador; an additional center in China was included in the safety analysis only. Adult participants (>/=18 years of age) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a total of three 25-mug doses (30 days apart) of ZF2001 or placebo. The primary end point was the occurrence of symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), as confirmed on polymerase-chain-reaction assay, at least 7 days after receipt of the third dose. A key secondary efficacy end point was the occurrence of severe-to-critical Covid-19 (including Covid-19-related death) at least 7 days after receipt of the third dose. RESULTS: Between December 12, 2020, and December 15, 2021, a total of 28,873 participants received at least one dose of ZF2001 or placebo and were included in the safety analysis; 25,193 participants who had completed the three-dose regimen, for whom there were approximately 6 months of follow-up data, were included in the updated primary efficacy analysis that was conducted at the second data cutoff date of December 15, 2021. In the updated analysis, primary end-point cases were reported in 158 of 12,625 participants in the ZF2001 group and in 580 of 12,568 participants in the placebo group, for a vaccine efficacy of 75.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 71.0 to 79.8). Severe-to-critical Covid-19 occurred in 6 participants in the ZF2001 group and in 43 in the placebo group, for a vaccine efficacy of 87.6% (95% CI, 70.6 to 95.7); Covid-19-related death occurred in 2 and 12 participants, respectively, for a vaccine efficacy of 86.5% (95% CI, 38.9 to 98.5). The incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events was balanced in the two groups, and there were no vaccine-related deaths. Most adverse reactions (98.5%) were of grade 1 or 2. CONCLUSIONS: In a large cohort of adults, the ZF2001 vaccine was shown to be safe and effective against symptomatic and severe-to-critical Covid-19 for at least 6 months after full vaccination.

34655106,The potential roles of pharmacy medication sales data to augment the syndromic surveillance system in response to COVID-19 and preparedness for other future infectious disease outbreaks in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Indonesia faces a continuous threat from communicable disease outbreaks. The current COVID-19 outbreak, the previous one of SARS, and many other infectious outbreaks encountered in the country warn of the need to develop comprehensive early warning systems to enable timely health responses in the long run. In this article, we argue that over the counter medication sales data at community pharmacies in Indonesia can potentially augment and increase the detection power of the current syndromic surveillance system, particularly in dealing with COVID-19 and other future infectious disease outbreaks in the country. MAIN BODY: This article discusses the experience of other countries in employing pharmacy medication sales data to serve as potential syndromic surveillance platform and contribute to pandemic responses. We argue why it is worth considering utilising medication sales data from pharmacies in Indonesia to support the current surveillance system which enables the provision of early warnings of disease outbreaks. We then discuss the potential challenges of operationalising these data and suggest a way forward for the development and implementation of the syndromic surveillance system at community pharmacy settings in Indonesia. CONCLUSION: While there are several challenges in developing a workable system in Indonesia that need to be addressed, introducing a syndromic surveillance system using pharmacy-setting medication sales data is worth investigating in the country.","Wulandari LPL, Sawitri AAS, Hermansyah A",Int J Health Plann Manage,2022 Jan,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
35719313,"A systematic review of the case findings, testing and management of COVID-19.","Background: Mass testing and adequate management are essential to terminate the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This testing is due to the possibility of unidentified cases, especially ones without COVID-19 related symptoms. This review aimed to examine the outcome of the existing studies on the ways of identifying COVID-19 cases, and determine the populations at risk, symptom and diagnostic test management of  COVID-19. Methods: The articles reviewed were scientific publications on the PubMed, Science Direct, ProQuest, and Scopus databases. The keywords used to obtain the data were COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and case detection, case management or diagnostic test. We applied the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Population, Intervention, Control and Outcomes (PICO) approaches. Results: A total of 21 articles from 13 countries met the inclusion criteria and were further analyzed qualitatively. However, 62% of the articles used a rapid antibody test for screening rather than a rapid antigen test. According to the rapid antigen test, 51.3% were positive, with men aged above 50 years recording the highest number of cases. Furthermore, 57.1% of patients were symptomatic, while diagnostic tests' sensitivity and specificity increased to 100% in 14 days after the onset. Conclusions:  Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)  is recommended by the World Health Organization for detection of COVID-19. Suppose it is unavailable, the rapid antigen test is used as an alternative rather than the rapid antibody test. Diagnosis is expected to be confirmed using the PCR and serological assay to achieve an early diagnosis of COVID-19, according to disease progression, gradual rapid tests can be used, such as rapid antigen in an earlier week and antibody tests confirmed by RT-PCR and serological assay in the second week of COVID-19.","Susanna D, Pratiwi D, Purnama SG",F1000Res,2021,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
36640798,"Immunogenicity and safety in healthy adults of full dose versus half doses of COVID-19 vaccine (ChAdOx1-S or BNT162b2) or full-dose CoronaVac administered as a booster dose after priming with CoronaVac: a randomised, observer-masked, controlled trial in Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: Inactivated COVID-19 vaccines effectively prevent death, but their effectiveness for preventing infection or severe illness is known to decrease within 3-6 months following the second priming dose. Here we aimed to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of three potential booster vaccines administered as a full-dose homologous booster or full-dose or half-dose heterologous boosters among individuals primed with CoronaVac. METHODS: We did an observer and participant masked, randomised controlled trial study of healthy Indonesian adults from five recruitment sites in Bandung and Jakarta, Indonesia, aged 18 years and older who had previously received two doses of CoronaVac within 3 to less than 6 months or 6 to 9 months before the booster dose. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1) by means of stratified randomisation with random block size to a homologous booster with full-dose CoronaVac or heterologous boosters with ChAdOx1-S or BNT162b2 in full dose or half dose. The primary outcome was to evaluate the seropositive, seroconversion rate, and the geometric mean titres of IgG anti-spike-receptor binding domain and neutralising antibodies, 28 days after booster dose vaccination in the per-protocol population. Safety was assessed as a secondary outcome in all vaccinated booster participants by the incidence rate and intensity of adverse events within 24 h, 7 days, and 28 days after the booster dose. This study is registered with ina-registry.org, INA-GO0HLGB, and is complete. FINDINGS: Between Nov 26 and Dec 16, 2021, 1015 people were screened, and 960 healthy adults were enrolled; 190-193 were included in each group. 28 days after receiving the booster, combining the 3 to less than 6 months and 6 to 9 months groups, the proportions of seroconversion rates in each vaccine group were ChAdOx1-S 75 (82%) of 92 to 87 (88%) of 99 for full dose and half dose, BNT162b2 92 (92%) of 100 to 90 (98%) of 92 for full dose and half dose, and CoronaVac in 38 (41%) of 92 to 65 (66%) of 98. All booster groups achieved 100% seropositivity 28 days after the booster dose. Participants in the 6 to 9 months priming group achieved higher titres compared with participants in the 3 to less than 6 months priming group. The geometric mean titres in participants in the 6 to 9 months priming group in each vaccine group were ChAdOx1-S 11258.69 (9562.43-13 255.85) and 7853.04 (6698.92-9206.00) for full dose and half dose, BNT162b2 19999.84 (17 720.58-22 572.25) and 17 017.62 (14 694.40-19 708.16) for full dose and half dose and CoronaVac 1440.55 (1172.81-1769.42) achieved higher titres compared with participants in the 3 to less than 6 months priming group which in each vaccine group were ChAdOx1-S 7730.39 (6401.87-9334.60) and 6684.34 (5678.94-7867.73) for full dose and half dose, BNT162b2 16594.08 (13 993.08-19 678.55) and 12 121.67 (9925.21-14 804.19) for full dose and half dose, and CoronaVac 1210.23 (976.49-1499.92). The median percentage inhibition for the surrogate virus neutralisation test against the delta B.1.617.2 and wild-type (WT) variant before the booster and 28 days after the booster dose was very high in all groups (p<0.001), all with greater than 90% inhibition against both delta and WT strains. No serious adverse events were associated with the vaccines. Within the heterologous booster groups, the adverse event rates in the half-dose groups were lower compared with the full-dose groups. INTERPRETATION: Geometric mean titre values between participants in the 6 to 9 months priming group and the 3 to less than 6 months priming group before the booster dose and between half-dose and full-dose groups 28 days before the booster were not significantly different for half-dose ChAdOx1-S, full-dose BNT162b2, and CoronaVac and were significantly different for full-dose ChAdOx1-S and half-dose BNT162b2. Among individuals primed with CoronaVac, boosting with BNT162b2 (full dose or half dose) or ChAdOx1-S (full dose or half dose) produces substantially better immune responses than in those boosted with CoronaVac. Full-dose and half-dose boosting with either BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1-S produced similar responses. Heterologous booster with half-dose might be considered in adults primed with two doses of CoronaVac vaccine. FUNDING: Ministry of Health, Indonesia.

34794908,Efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19: A non-randomized comparative study with historical control in a referral hospital in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Studies to confirm the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma (CP) as an adjunctive treatment for COVID-19 are still required especially for the countries where standard treatments are unevenly distributed. METHODS: A non-randomized comparative study was done from June - September 2020 in Dr. Sardjito Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Plasma with anti-SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG titer of >1:320 were used. Primary end points were clinical and laboratory parameters outcome including BGA, chest X-ray, CT value, CRP, procalcitonin, IL-6, D-Dimer and ALC examined on day 1, 2 and 7 post-transfusion. RESULTS: The experimental arm of this study consisted of 15 patients who received CP: 3 (20%) with moderate COVID-19 and 12 (80%) with severe COVID-19. There were 15 historical controls in this study. Ten recipients survived and 5 deceased (survival rate was 66.7%). There were higher rate of pneumonia resolution (OR 1.54, CI95% 0.33-7.23), ARDS resolution (OR 1.20, CI95% 0.25-5.84) and shorter median length of stay (20 vs 22 days, p = 0.41) among recipients compared to controls. Lower mortality rate was observed in recipients vs controls (33.3% vs 46.7% (OR 0.75, CI95% 0.17-3.33)). Median death onset was longer in recipient vs control (7(th) vs 1(st) day, p = 0.13). Survival analysis showed protective effect of CP (HR 0.69, CI 95% 0.21-2.27, p = 0.545). Higher CT value improvement (p = 0.51) and negative conversion rate (OR1.20, CI95% 0.25-5.84) were observed in recipients compared to controls. Sub-analysis showed more number of comorbidities, higher procalcitonin and higher D-Dimer among CP recipients who did not survive (p = 0.02 and p = 0.02 respectively). Lower CRP and procalcitonin, and higher ALC were found in survivors compared to non-survivors (p = 0.0437; p = 0.0049; and p = 0.0002 respectively). CONCLUSION: This study showed promising results for CP marked by improvements in clinical outcome, as well as significant reduction of inflammatory markers among recipients.","Kurnianda J, Hardianti MS, Triyono T, Thobari JA, Trisnawati I, Wisudarti CFR, Sukorini U, Anshori F, Setiawan SA, Ucche M, Farahnaz A, Suryani Y",J Infect Public Health,2022 Jan,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
33648516,Willingness to volunteer and readiness to practice of undergraduate medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional survey in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: The question to involve or restrict medical students' involvement in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic response remains contentious. As their state of preparation and perceptions in volunteering during this pandemic have yet to be investigated, this study aims to evaluate Indonesian medical students' willingness to volunteer and readiness to practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted among undergraduate medical students throughout Indonesia. Socio-demographic and social interaction information, in addition to willingness to volunteer and readiness to practice, were obtained using a self-reported questionnaire. The significance level was set at 5%. RESULTS: Among 4870 participants, 2374 (48.7%) expressed their willingness to volunteer, while only 906 (18.6%) had adequate readiness to practice. Male students, students with prior volunteering experience in health or non-health sectors, and students from public universities or living in Central Indonesia (vs Java) had higher scores of willingness and readiness to volunteer. Students from Sumatra also had better preparedness (odds ratio [OR] 1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15-2.12, p = 0.004), while the opposite occurred for students from Eastern Indonesia (OR 0.63, 95% CI: 0.44-0.89, p = 0.002)-when compared to students from Java. In addition, compared to students with high family income, students from lower-middle income families were less willing to volunteer (OR 0.76, 95% CI: 0.59-0.98, p = 0.034), though those with low family income had better readiness (OR 1.51, 95% CI: 1.10-2.08, p = 0.011). Shortage of medical personnel, sense of duty, and solicitation by stakeholders were the main reasons increasing the students' willingness to volunteer; whereas contrarily fear for own's health, absence of a cure, and fear of harming patients were the primary factors diminishing their willingness to volunteer. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that many Indonesian medical students are willing to volunteer, yet only few of them were ready to practice, indicating that further preparations are required to maximize their potentials and minimize their exposure to hazards. We suggest that their potentials as a firm support system during the pandemic should not be overlooked, and that the integration of relevant courses to the medical curricula are imperative to prepare for future public health emergencies.","Lazarus G, Findyartini A, Putera AM, Gamalliel N, Nugraha D, Adli I, Phowira J, Azzahra L, Ariffandi B, Widyahening IS",BMC Med Educ,2021 Mar 1,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
34654384,Adolescents' physical activity and sedentary behaviour in Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study of mothers' perspectives.,"BACKGROUND: Socio-behavioural adaptations during the COVID-19 pandemic may have significantly affected adolescents' lifestyle. This study aimed to explore possible reasons affecting changes in physical activity and sedentary behaviour in Indonesian adolescents during the pandemic based on mothers' perspectives. METHODS: We recruited parents (n = 20) from the Yogyakarta region of Indonesia (July-August 2020) using purposive and snowball sampling. Individual interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and anonymised. Data were imported into NVivo software for a reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: The interviews lasted between 38 and 113 min (M = 65 min). Participants' age ranged between 36 and 54 years (M = 42.6 years). Participants' children ranged in age from 12 to 15 years (M = 13.7 years, female: 9, male: 11). Themes related to changes in physical activity during the pandemic were 1) self-determination and enjoyment, 2) supports from others, and 3) physical activity facilities and equipment. Themes related to changes in sedentary behaviour during the pandemic included 1) educational demands, 2) psychological effects due to the pandemic, 3) devices and internet availability, 4) parental control, and 5) social facilitators. CONCLUSIONS: During the pandemic, mothers perceived their children to be less active and using more screen-based devices, either for educational or recreational purposes, compared to before. The present themes might be useful when developing interventions and policies promoting physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviour in adolescents. Interventions could, for example, consider increasing parents' and adolescents' awareness on current activity guidelines, providing education on healthier recreational screen time, and involving parents, peers, and teachers. Increasing the accessibility of physical activity facilities and equipment, making use of adolescents' favourite program and social media for interventions, and providing activities that are fun and enjoyable may also important.","Andriyani FD, Biddle SJH, De Cocker K",BMC Public Health,2021 Oct 15,COVID-19 AND Indonesia

Limited published clinical data, scarcity and long turn over time of diagnostic testing put clinician in dilemma to make diagnosis. METHODOLOGY: This is an observational case series study from confirmed COVID-19 patient in our hospital from first case admission on 17 March 30 April, 2020. We collected patient's demography, symptoms, comorbidities, therapy, laboratory, chest x-ray and ECG consecutively. RESULTS: Between 17 March 2020 and 30 April 2020, there were 30 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 16 (53.3%) were male. Clinical symptoms were dyspnea in 22 (73.3%) and dry cough 16 (53.3%). Comorbidities were diabetes in 14 (46.6%), hypertension 10 (33.3%) and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) in 10 (33.3%) patients respectively. Laboratory findings showed lymphopenia in 21 (70%) patients, increased inflammation marker in Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) 21 (70%), 23 (76.6%) and 12 (40%) patients respectively. Twenty-seven (90%) cases had abnormal Chest X-Ray (CXR) and mostly severe 18 (60%). Descriptive finding for images included consolidation 16 (53.3%) and Ground Glass Opacities (GGO) in 10 (33.3%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, most cases of COVID-19 admitted in secondary referral hospital were already in moderate to severe stages. This is most likely due to late referral from primary care and unspecific clinical features resemblance of other infectious diseases. Inflammation marker and CXR are cost effective findings and can be used as marker to determine further referral.","Hafiz M, Icksan AG, Harlivasari AD, Aulia R, Susanti F, Eldinia L",J Infect Dev Ctries,2020 Jul 31,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
33818412,"Impact of COVID-19 on the Gut: A Review of the Manifestations, Pathology, Management, and Challenges.","SARS-CoV-2 is a virus that can enter its hosts through the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor. ACE2 is mainly expressed in cells of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the esophageal epithelium and enterocytes from the ileum-colon. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has varying clinical symptoms and presents differently in individuals, ranging from asymptomatic carriers to moderate clinical spectrum with mild pneumonia clinical features, and to a severe clinical presentation with dyspnea and hypoxia, leading to death due to respiratory or multi-organ failure. COVID-19 infection can also manifest themselves in the form of gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain. Severe complications of gastrointestinal COVID-19 infections include hemorrhage or perforation of the gastrointestinal tract and severe inflammation, which can adversely affect the intestinal immune system, and therefore the systemic immune system of the host. Furthermore, COVID-19 has also shown to affect microbiota homeostasis in the digestive tract. To date, no clear explanation is available regarding the pathophysiology of gastrointestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection, fecal RNA detection, and the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. This review aims to discuss the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the digestive tract, microbiota, and lung, and the possibility of fecal-oral transmission in COVID-19.","Suryana KD, Simadibrata M, Renaldi K",Acta Med Indones,2021 Jan,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
34746079,Risk Perception of COVID-19 in Indonesia During the First Stage of the Pandemic.,"Community perceptions of early-stage pandemics may have significant implications for subsequent disease control and management. Perceptions of COVID-19 among Indonesian citizens were assessed 2 months after the first reported case in the country. The study used an online survey tool, which was adapted from a standardized questionnaire for risk perception of an infectious disease outbreak. The questions of the survey involved respondents' perceived level of knowledge, preparedness, efficacy of control measures, newness, infectiousness, seriousness, motivating and hindering factors, and effectiveness of prevention methods, as well as questions that assessed actual level of knowledge of respondents such as causative agents, modes of transmission, number of total cases, and available control measures. A total of 1,043 respondents participated in this study. The main sources of information of respondents were social media (85.2%) and online news (82.2%). Nearly all respondents were aware that COVID-19 is a viral disease with saliva droplets (97.1%) and contaminated surfaces (86.5%) being its main modes of transmission. Participants showed a good level of knowledge pertaining to control measures, an adequate level of belief toward their efficacy, and a willingness to implement such measures. More than 95% of the respondents perceived COVID-19 to be either serious or very serious. However, the level of anxiety among respondents was moderate, suggesting the presence of risk tolerance in the community. Individual characteristics such as gender, educational background, and occupation were found to have a statistically significant relationship with risk perception and tolerance, but voluntary participation in control measures was high and similar. This indicates that the COVID-19 health campaign during early pandemic in Indonesia was a success. This research also revealed certain areas where health promotion, education, and awareness might be improved.","Tejamaya M, Widanarko B, Erwandi D, Putri AA, Sunarno SDAM, Wirawan IMA, Kurniawan B, Thamrin Y",Front Public Health,2021,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
34227102,Prioritizing pregnant women for COVID-19 vaccination.,"Despite emerging evidence on safety and efficacy, most countries do not offer COVID-19 vaccines to pregnant women even though they are at higher risk of complications from COVID-19. We performed a web search of COVID-19 vaccination policies for pregnant women under two categories: countries bearing a high burden of COVID-19 cases and countries with a high burden of maternal and under-five mortality. Of the top 20 countries affected by COVID-19, 11 allow vaccination of pregnant women, of which two have deemed it safe to vaccinate pregnant women as a high-risk group. In contrast, only five of the 20 countries with high under-five mortality and maternal mortality allow vaccination of pregnant women and none of these countries has included them as part of a high-risk group that should be vaccinated. India and Indonesia, with one-fifth of the world's population, fall under both categories but do not include pregnant women as a priority group for COVID-19 vaccination. To prevent COVID-19 from further aggravating the already heavy burden of maternal and under-five mortality, there is a strong case for including pregnant women as a high-priority group for COVID-19 vaccination. We recommend including COVID-19 vaccination in routine antenatal care in all countries, particularly India and Indonesia in view of their high dual burden.","Sarwal Y, Sarwal T, Sarwal R",Int J Gynaecol Obstet,2021 Oct,COVID-19 AND Indonesia

36617704,Efficacy and safety of tixagevimab-cilgavimab as pre-exposure prophylaxis for COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Some proportions of populations, such as immunocompromised patients and organ transplant recipients might have inadequate immune responses to the vaccine for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). For these groups of populations, administering monoclonal antibodies might offer some additional protection. This review sought to analyze the effectiveness and safety of tixagevimab-cilgavimab (Evusheld) as pre-exposure prophylaxis against COVID-19. We used specific keywords to comprehensively search for potential studies on PubMed, Scopus, Europe PMC, and ClinicalTrials.gov sources until 3 September 2022. We collected all published articles that analyzed tixagevimab-cilgavimab on the course of COVID-19. Review Manager 5.4 was utilized for statistical analysis. Six studies were included. Our pooled analysis revealed that tixagevimab-cilgavimab prophylaxis may decrease the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR: 0.24; 95% CI: 0.15-0.40, p < 0.00001, I(2)  = 75%), lower COVID-19 hospitalization rate (OR: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.07-0.24, p < 0.00001, I(2)  = 0%), decrease the severity risk (OR: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.07-0.24, p < 0.00001, I(2)  = 0%), and lower COVID-19 deaths (OR: 0.17; 95% CI: 0.03-0.99, p = 0.05, I(2)  = 72%). In the included studies, no major adverse events were reported. This study proposes that tixagevimab-cilgavimab was effective and safe for preventing COVID-19. Tixagevimab-cilgavimab may be offered to those who cannot be vaccinated or have inadequate immune response from the COVID-19 vaccine to give additional protection.","Soeroto AY, Yanto TA, Kurniawan A, Hariyanto TI",Rev Med Virol,2023 Mar,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
36891928,Marketing of commercial milk formula during COVID-19 in Indonesia.,"Baby food marketing poses a substantial barrier to breastfeeding, which adversely affects mothers' and children's health. Over the last decade, the baby food industry has utilised various marketing tactics in Indonesia, including direct marketing to mothers and promoting products in public spaces and within the healthcare system. This study examined the marketing of commercial milk formula (CMF) and other breast-milk substitute products during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. Using a local, community-based reporting platform, information on publicly reported violations of the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes and subsequent World Health Assembly resolutions (the Code) was collected. It was found that a total of 889 reported cases of unethical marketing of such products were recorded primarily through social media from May 20 through December 31, 2021. Our results suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has provided more opportunities for the baby food industry in Indonesia to attempt to circumvent the Code aggressively through online marketing strategies. These aggressive marketing activities include online advertisements, maternal child health and nutrition webinars, Instagram sessions with experts, and heavy engagement of health professionals and social media influencers. Moreover, product donations and assistance with COVID-19 vaccination services were commonly used to create a positive image of the baby food industry in violation of the Code. Therefore, there is an urgent need to regulate the online marketing of milk formula and all food and beverage products for children under the age of 3.","Hidayana I, Prawindarti L, Umar N, Ambarwati K, Rosatriani F",Matern Child Nutr,2023 Jul,COVID-19 AND Indonesia

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify various factors and causal interaction patterns that affect the inclusiveness of workers with disabilities in pandemic situations, a dynamic system is needed to capture causal interaction patterns related to the inclusiveness of workers with disabilities in pandemic situations. METHOD: This study used a causal loop diagram approach, which is part of a dynamic system that begins with determining the interaction of causal variables. The process of identifying and extracting data was carried out through a literature review and in-depth interviews with informants who met the principles of appropriateness and adequacy criteria. RESULT: The interaction pattern between the factors that influence the inclusiveness of disabled workers was depicted in three causal loop diagrams covering three major domains, namely social, educational, and economic aspects. The three causal loop diagrams showed an increasingly dynamic interaction pattern during the COVID-19 pandemic, considering that workers with disabilities have greater vulnerability, which impacts their level of acceptance and inclusiveness at work. RECOMMENDATION: There needs to be a specific policy to expand the acceptance of workers with disabilities by strengthening cross-sectoral collaboration and company commitments. The existence of a policy that prioritizes education, increases the budget, and procures adequate infrastructure for people with disabilities is a government commitment that is demanded to be fulfilled during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ayuningtyas D, Ardi NS, Barinda S, Larasanti A, Napitupulu T, Margaretha C, Hasibuan SU",Front Public Health,2022,COVID-19 AND Indonesia

34245436,Social support through religion and psychological well-being: COVID-19 and coping strategies in Indonesia.,"The Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) originated in China at the end of 2019, the virus festered there for four months before spreading globally. Impacting the developed and developing world including Indonesia. It has transformed social, economic and political practices social life, everyday habits and government policies, with multi-dimensional consequences on human life. The present study endeavours to explore the relationship between religiosity, social capital, and psychological well-being of the general public, particularly in terms of coping with the pandemic. In addition to this, the study aims to highlight the importance of public awareness regarding social distancing, use of religion as a coping mechanism, and living a healthy lifestyle during pandemic. For knowing the perception of the masses, an online survey by using a self-administered questionnaire was carried out among coronavirus patients, the general public, social media activists, students, and professionals across Indonesia. The findings indicate that the pandemic has altered the lifestyle of the masses in different ways and that people have varied perceptions towards this virus regarding its spread and preventive measures. The study also reveals that, social capital (beta = .418, p < .001), psychological well-being (beta = .343, p < .001), and religious coping (beta = .145, p <. 01) have a significant amount of the variance of coronavirus situational stress (F =  69.77, p < .001, R2 = 0.485). Lastly, the study suggests that, adopting preventative measures, standard operating procedures that are sustainable and healthy forms of coping with the pandemic will be equally as important as medical care in order to contain and eventually eradicate the virus.","Saud M, Ashfaq A, Abbas A, Ariadi S, Mahmood QK",J Relig Health,2021 Oct,COVID-19 AND Indonesia
39280281,"Determinants of COVID-19 severity and mortality in children: A retrospective and multicenter cohort study in Medan, Indonesia.","This study investigated indicators of the severity and mortality of COVID-19 in children in Medan, Sumatera Utara Province, Indonesia. The aim of this study was to identify determinants of severity and outcome of children with COVID-19 as the lesson learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the limited health facilities in Indonesia. This retrospective cohort study was conducted in 2020, 2021, and 2022 at multiple centers. Inpatient and outpatient children confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive were randomly recruited in the selected hospitals. Baseline data (demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological data) were collected, and outcomes were classified as recovered/deceased (for the inpatient group) or returned to the hospital (for the outpatient group). Severity status was identified based on the Indonesia COVID-19 guidelines. The laboratory data were categorized according to international standards and data were analyzed using univariate analyzes followed by multivariate logistic regression. A total of 303 inpatient and 114 outpatient children were included in the analysis. Out of the total inpatient cases, nine patients died, with 2.9 mortality rate. Our final multivariate indicated that the presence of shortness of breath (SOB), anemia, and abnormal C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were significantly associated with the severity or the presence of emergency signs, while the presence of SOB and comorbidities were significantly associated with mortality in inpatient children with COVID-19. The presence of fever, cough, SOB, muscle ache and diarrhea were the reasons why the children were returned to the hospital from self-isolation at home among outpatient COVID-19 cases; however, the cough was the only significant factor in the final multivariate mode. This study highlights important determinants of COVID-19 severity and mortality in children, which should be considered during clinical decision-making in low-resource settings of healthcare centers in Indonesia.","Airlangga E, Wahyuni AS, Siregar J, Malisie RF, Lubis BM, Adisasmito WB, Zarlis M, Pasaribu AP",Narra J,2024 Aug,COVID-19 AND Indonesia

These factors include undetected cases, asymptomatic cases, and several non-pharmaceutical interventions. Because of the rapid spread of COVID-19 worldwide, understanding the significance of these factors is crucial in determining whether COVID-19 will be eradicated or persist in the population. Hence, in this study, we establish a new mathematical model to predict the spread of COVID-19 considering mentioned factors. RESULTS: Infection detection and vaccination have the potential to eradicate COVID-19 from Jakarta. From the sensitivity analysis, we find that rapid testing is crucial in reducing the basic reproduction number when COVID-19 is endemic in the population rather than contact trace. Furthermore, our results indicate that a vaccination strategy has the potential to relax social distancing rules, while maintaining the basic reproduction number at the minimum possible, and also eradicate COVID-19 from the population with a higher vaccination rate. In conclusion, our model proposed a mathematical model that can be used by Jakarta's government to relax social distancing policy by relying on future COVID-19 vaccine potential.","Aldila D, Samiadji BM, Simorangkir GM, Khosnaw SHA, Shahzad M",BMC Res Notes,2021 Apr 12,COVID-19 AND Indonesia

35108277,mRNA Covid-19 vaccines in pregnancy: A systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE: Pregnancy is a known risk factor for severe Coronavirus disease 2019. It is important to develop safe vaccines that elicit strong maternal and fetal antibody responses. METHODS: Registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO Clinical Trial Registry, and the European Union Clinical Trial Registry) and databases (MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, Proquest, Springer, medRxiv, and bioRxiv) were systematically searched in June 20-22, 2021, for research articles pertaining to Covid-19 and pregnancy. Manual searches of bioRxiv and medRxiv were also conducted. Inclusion criteria were studies that focused on Covid-19 vaccination among pregnant women, while review articles and non-human studies were excluded. Infection rate, maternal antibody response, transplacental antibody transfer, and adverse events were described. RESULTS: There were 13 observational studies with a total of 48,039 pregnant women who received mRNA vaccines. Of those, three studies investigated infection rate, six studies investigated maternal antibody response, seven studies investigated antibody transfer, three studies reported local adverse events, and five studies reported systemic adverse events. The available data suggested that the mRNA-based vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) can prevent future SARS-CoV-2 infection. These vaccines did not show clear harm in pregnancy. The most commonly encountered adverse reactions were pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache, but these were transient. Antibody responses were rapid after the first vaccine dose. After the booster, antibody responses were stronger and associated with better transplacental antibody transfer. Longer intervals between first vaccination dose and delivery were also associated with higher antibody fetal IgG and a better antibody transfer ratio. CONCLUSIONS: The SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines are encouraged for pregnancy. These vaccines can be a safe option for pregnant women and their fetuses. Two vaccine doses are recommended for more robust maternal and fetal antibody responses. Longer latency is associated with higher fetal antibody responses. Further research about its long-term effect on pregnancy is needed.

36957989,Importance of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) has been shown to have a favorable effect on many diseases as a complementary therapy and is a critical component of healthy living. During the pandemic era, physical activity has been promoted for resistance against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, there is scarce evidence on whether MVPA could reduce the infectivity and susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The objective of this meta-analysis was to determine the effect of MVPA on morbidity, mortality, and duration of hospitalization in COVID-19 patients. We performed a comprehensive search of five online databases for eligible studies up to September 9, 2021. Meta-analyses were conducted to determine the association between MVPA and COVID-19-related morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality. The odds ratio (OR) was applied as the summary statistic for the primary outcomes. Secondary analyses were conducted to evaluate the difference in the metabolic equivalent of tasks (METs) between the outcome and non-outcome groups with the mean difference as the pooled effect. This meta-analysis included eight observational studies. We found that MVPA significantly reduced the odds of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR=0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.85-0.92), hospitalization (OR=0.56; 95% CI=0.35-0.92), and mortality (OR=0.42; 95% CI=0.21-0.81) due to COVID-19 compared to no physical activity. METs>/=500 min/week were linked to decreased morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 (OR=0.94 [95% CI=0.90-0.98]; OR=0.56 [95% CI=0.38-0.83]). COVID-19 patients with MVPA demonstrated a lower risk of COVID-19-related morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality compared to those who were less active, highlighting the importance of an active lifestyle despite the pandemic situation where such activities are limited.","Rejeki PS, Witarto BS, Witarto AP, Rifdah SN, Wafa IA, Utami DM, Izzatunnisa N, Kencono Wungu CD, Khaerunnisa S, Sakina, Fazleen Mohd Fathil NE",J Basic Clin Physiol Pharmacol,2023 May 1,COVID-19 AND Indonesia

36845324,"Avian influenza (H5N1) virus, epidemiology and its effects on backyard poultry in Indonesia: a review.","Avian influenza (AI) is a zoonotic viral endemic disease that affects poultry, swine, and mammals, including humans. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is caused by influenza type A virus subtypes H5, and H7 which are naturally carried by a wild bird and often affect domestic poultry. Avian influenza (AI) is a major problem worldwide that causes significant economic losses in the poultry sector. Since 2003, the widespread H5N1 HPAI in poultry has led to high mortalities resulting in huge economic losses in the poultry sector in Indonesia. Domestic poultry is a key source of income that contributes to economic growth, both directly and indirectly, by reducing poverty among the people living in rural communities. Furthermore, in many developing countries, including Indonesia, rural people meet a portion of their food needs through backyard poultry. Nevertheless, this sector is strongly affected by biosecurity hazards, particularly in Indonesia by HPAI infections. Avian influenza (AI), subtype H5N1 has zoonotic significance, posing major risks to public health and poultry. Due to close interaction between wild migratory birds and ducks, the domestic poultry sector in Indonesia is directly affected by this virus. This virus continues to be ubiquitous in Indonesia as a result of the unpredictable mutations produced by antigenic drift and shift, which can persist from a few days to several years. In this review, the epidemiology and impact, of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 subtype virus infection on backyard poultry in Indonesia were discussed.","Rehman S, Effendi MH, Witaningruma AM, Nnabuikeb UE, Bilal M, Abbas A, Abbas RZ, Hussain K",F1000Res,2022,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia

Having originated in farmed poultry, H5N1 viruses are now spread globally by wild birds, with transmission to many mammal and avian species, resulting in 2024 in transmission among dairy cattle with associated human cases. These ecological changes pose challenges to mitigating the impacts of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza on wildlife, ecosystems, domestic animals, food security, and humans. H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza highlights the need for One Health approaches to pandemic prevention and preparedness, emphasising multisectoral collaborations among animal, environmental, and public health sectors. Action is needed to reduce future pandemic risks by preventing transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza among domestic and wild animals and people, focusing on upstream drivers of outbreaks, and ensuring rapid responses and risk assessments for zoonotic outbreaks. Political commitment and sustainable funding are crucial to implementing and maintaining prevention programmes, surveillance, and outbreak responses.","Koopmans MPG, Barton Behravesh C, Cunningham AA, Adisasmito WB, Almuhairi S, Bilivogui P, Bukachi SA, Casas N, Cediel Becerra N, Charron DF, Chaudhary A, Ciacci Zanella JR, Dar O, Debnath N, Dungu B, Farag E, Gao GF, Khaitsa M, Machalaba C, Mackenzie JS, Markotter W, Mettenleiter TC, Morand S, Smolenskiy V, Zhou L, Hayman DTS",Lancet Infect Dis,2024 Dec,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia

This study aimed to characterize transmission dynamics of H5N1 over time using novel Bayesian phylogeography methods to identify factors which have influenced the spread of H5N1 in Indonesia. We used publicly available hemagglutinin sequence data sampled between 2003 and 2016 to model ancestral state reconstruction of HPAI H5N1 evolution. We found strong support for H5N1 transmission routes between provinces in Java Island and inter-island transmissions, such as between Nusa Tenggara and Kalimantan Islands, not previously described. The spread is consistent with wild bird flyways and poultry trading routes. H5N1 migration was associated with the regions of high chicken densities and low human development indices. These results can be used to inform more targeted planning of H5N1 control and prevention activities in Indonesia.","Njoto EN, Scotch M, Bui CM, Adam DC, Chughtai AA, MacIntyre CR",Transbound Emerg Dis,2018 Oct,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
22956392,H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza in Indonesia: retrospective considerations.,"Indonesia is one of the five countries where highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of the H5N1 subtype (H5N1 HPAI) remain endemic in poultry. Importantly, it is one of the countries where the virus causes human infections. WHO data indicate that as of 2 May 2012, 189 human cases of Influenza A (H5N1) had been reported in Indonesia, with 157 human deaths. These human cases included a small number in which limited human-to-human transmission could have occurred. Hence, there remains a critical need in Indonesia for a more effective One Health approach to the control and prevention of this disease in people and in poultry. This chapter explores a number of aspects of the evolution of this disease in Indonesia, the virus that causes it and the control and preventive measures introduced, focusing on the successes and shortcomings of veterinary and One Health approaches. Indonesia provides many examples of situations where this latter approach has been successful, and others where further work is needed to maximize the benefits from coordinated responses to this disease leading to effective management of the risk to human health.","Daniels P, Wiyono A, Sawitri E, Poermadjaja B, Sims LD",Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,2013,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia

Although 28% (2,810/10,135) of case-patients reported exposure to poultry, only 1 SARI case-patient with an H5N1 virus infection was detected. Therefore, targeted screening among case-patients with high-risk poultry exposures (e.g., a recent visit to a live bird market or close proximity to sick or dead poultry) may be a more efficient routine surveillance strategy for H5N1 virus in these types of settings.","Lafond KE, Praptiningsih CY, Mangiri A, Syarif M, Triada R, Mulyadi E, Septiawati C, Setiawaty V, Samaan G, Storms AD, Uyeki TM, Iuliano AD",Emerg Infect Dis,2019 Nov,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
28780119,Vaccine efficacy against Indonesian Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1: systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Indonesia has implemented multiple strategies to control Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 (HPAI/H5N1), including the licensure and use of multiple vaccine formulations. The continuous drift of Indonesian HPAI/H5N1 viruses and emergence of a new clade in 2012 that became dominant in 2016, demands the assessment of commercial vaccine formulations against Indonesian field viruses. Seven databases were explored to identify relevant literature reporting performance of commercial vaccines against Indonesian HPAI/H5N1 viruses. After methodological assessment, data were collated and analyzed to report immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy (VE) to prevent respiratory and cloacal viral shedding 2-day post challenge, and death at the end of the follow-up period. Meta-analyses were performed to assess VE consistency of alternative formulations and to explore sources of heterogeneity in VE. In total, 65 studies and 46 vaccine formulations from 13 articles were grouped per OIE's VE protocols (group 1) and variations of it (groups 2,3,4). We found that concurrence of vaccine-seed and challenge-viruses in a clade designation might be a better proxy of VE than current estimates based on vaccine-homologous HI antibody titers, particularly against current fourth order clade viruses (groups 1&2). Prime-boosting was efficacious across different chicken breeds (group 3), and early vaccination may increase the risk of death (group 4). One Indonesian vaccine was tested against the new dominant clade, conferring consistent protection in chickens but not in ducks. Meta-analyses revealed high inconsistency (I(2)>/=75%) and inefficacy of LPAI formulations against current field viruses, while potential sources of inconsistent VE were formulation of seed-homologous vaccines and the species vaccinated. We conclude that the VE of commercial vaccines in Indonesia changes as Indonesian HPAI/H5N1 evolve into new clades, which should warrant continuous matching between vaccine-seeds and emerging HPAI/H5N1. Furthermore, given the characteristics of the new Indonesian dominant HPAI/H5N1 clade, further studies to confirm VE across species are warranted.","Villanueva-Cabezas JP, Coppo MJC, Durr PA, McVernon J",Vaccine,2017 Sep 5,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
36846456,Whole-genome sequence and genesis of an avian influenza virus H5N1 isolated from a healthy chicken in a live bird market in Indonesia: accumulation of mammalian adaptation markers in avian hosts.,"BACKGROUND: Influenza A viruses are a major pathogen that causes significant clinical and economic harm to many animals. In Indonesia, the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus has been endemic in poultry since 2003 and has caused sporadic deadly infections in humans. The genetic bases that determine host range have not yet been fully elucidated. We analyzed the whole-genome sequence of a recent H5 isolate to reveal the evolution toward its mammalian adaptation. METHODS: We determined the whole-genome sequence of A/chicken/East Java/Av1955/2022 (hereafter, ""Av1955"") from a healthy chicken in April 2022 and conducted phylogenetic and mutational analysis. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Av1955 belonged to the H5N1 clade 2.3.2.1c (Eurasian lineage). The six gene segments (PB1, PB2, HA, NP, NA, and NS) out of the eight segments derived from viruses of H5N1 Eurasian lineage, one (PB2) from the H3N6 subtype and the remaining one (M) from the H5N1 clade 2.1.3.2b (Indonesian lineage). The donor of the PB2 segment was a reassortant among three viruses of H5N1 Eurasian and Indonesian lineages and the H3N6 subtype. The HA amino acid sequence contained multiple basic amino acids at the cleavage site. Mutation analysis revealed that Av1955 possessed the maximal number of mammalian adaptation marker mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Av1955 was a virus of H5N1 Eurasian lineage. The HA protein contains an HPAI H5N1-type cleavage site sequence, while the virus was isolated from a healthy chicken suggesting its low pathogenicity nature. The virus has increased mammalian adaptation markers by mutation and intra- and inter-subtype reassortment, gathering gene segments possessing the most abundant maker mutations among previously circulating viruses. The increasing mammalian adaptation mutation in avian hosts suggests that they might be adaptive to infection in mammalian and avian hosts. It highlights the importance of genomic surveillance and adequate control measures for H5N1 infection in live poultry markets.","Rehman S, Prasetya RR, Rahardjo K, Effendi MH, Rantam FA, Rahmahani J, Witaningrum AM, Nastri AM, Dewantari JR, Mori Y, Shimizu K",PeerJ,2023,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
30866780,Genetic diversity and host adaptation of avian H5N1 influenza viruses during human infection.,"The continuing pandemic threat posed by avian influenza A/H5N1 viruses calls for improved insights into their evolution during human infection. We performed whole genome deep sequencing of respiratory specimens from 44 H5N1-infected individuals from Indonesia and found substantial within-host viral diversity. At nearly 30% of genome positions multiple amino acids were observed within or across samples, including positions implicated in aerosol transmission between ferrets. Amino acid variants detected our cohort were often found more frequently in available H5N1 sequences of human than avian isolates. We additionally identified previously unreported amino acid variants and multiple variants that increased in proportion over time in available sequential samples. Given the importance of the polymerase complex for host adaptation, we tested 121 amino acid variants found in the PB2, PB1 and PA subunits for their effects on polymerase activity in human cells. We identified multiple single amino acid variants in all three polymerase subunits that substantially increase polymerase activity including some with effects comparable to that of the widely recognized adaption and virulence marker PB2-E627 K. These results indicate highly dynamic evolutionary processes during human H5N1 virus infection and the potential existence of previously undocumented adaptive pathways.","Welkers MRA, Pawestri HA, Fonville JM, Sampurno OD, Pater M, Holwerda M, Han AX, Russell CA, Jeeninga RE, Setiawaty V, de Jong MD, Eggink D",Emerg Microbes Infect,2019,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
37363256,How human ecology landscapes shape the circulation of H5N1 avian influenza: A case study in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus consistently threatens global public health. A better understanding of the virus' circulation mechanism is needed for future epidemic prevention. Previous studies have focused on the correlations between the presence of H5N1 virus and wild bird populations, domestic poultry production, and sociodemographic factors. However, human cultural landscapes and their impact on H5N1 spread have not been adequately explored. METHODS: Using 196 HA gene sequences of H5N1 influenza viruses from Indonesia with district-level geographic information, we performed Monmonier barrier and Louvain community detection analyses to explore how human ecological factors impact the circulation of virus and identify barriers to or corridors of dispersal. RESULTS: Spatial discontinuity in the genetic characteristics identified by the Monmonier algorithm were found to mirror the differences in key landscape factors. Our Louvain community detection analysis also found the co-existence of different geographic circulation patterns. The community detection analysis suggests that direct human-related interactions such as poultry transportations between remote areas may result in similar viruses spreading in two distant regions whilst dense localities supported genetically heterogeneous viruses in geographically adjacent areas. CONCLUSION: Human ecological landscapes shape the circulation mechanism of H5N1 virus in multiple ways contingent upon local context. Physical and cultural barriers may impede its movement between adjacent areas, while natural or human-induced corridors such as wild bird flyways and poultry production networks facilitate its spread between geographically distant areas. Further focus on the importance of cultural landscapes has great potential for increasing our understanding of the circulation of pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in Southeast Asia.","Tang Z, Carrel M, Koylu C, Kitchen A",One Health,2023 Jun,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia

25003084,Evolutionary dynamics of highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5N1 HA clades and vaccine implementation in Vietnam.,"Based on hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), influenza A virus is divided into 18 different HA (H1 to H18) and 11 NA types (N1 to N11), opening the possibility for reassortment between the HA and NA genes to generate new HxNy subtypes (where x could be any HA and y is any NA, possibly). In recent four years, since 2010, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses of H5N1 subtype (HPAI A/H5N1) have become highly enzootic and dynamically evolved to form multiple H5 HA clades, particularly in China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Egypt, Cambodia, and Bangladesh. So far, after more than 10 years emerged in Vietnam (since late 2003), HPAI A/H5N1 is still posing a potential risk of causing outbreaks in poultry, with high frequency of annual endemics. Intragenic variation (referred to as antigenic drift) in HA (e.g., H5) has given rise to form numerous clades, typically marking the major timelines of the evolutionary status and vaccine application in each period. The dominance of genetically and antigenically diversified clade 2.3.2.1 (of subgroups a, b, c), clade 1.1 (1.1.1/1.1.2) and re-emergence of clade 7.1/7.2 at present, has urged Vietnam to the need for dynamically applied antigenicity-matching vaccines, i.e., the plan of importing Re-6 vaccine for use in 2014, in parallel use of Re-1/Re-5 since 2006. In this review, we summarize evolutionary features of HPAI A/H5N1 viruses and clade formation during recent 10 years (2004-2014). Dynamic of vaccine implementation in Vienam is also remarked.","Le TH, Nguyen NT",Clin Exp Vaccine Res,2014 Jul,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia

However, there is limited information on the genetic diversity of HPAI H5N1 viruses, especially those isolated from humans in Indonesia. In this study, the genetic and antigenic characteristics of 35 HPAI H5N1 viruses isolated from humans were analyzed. Full genome sequences were analyzed for the presence of substitutions in the receptor binding site, and polymerase complex, as markers for virulence or human adaptation, as well as antiviral drug resistance substitutions. Only a few substitutions associated with human adaptation were observed, a remarkably low prevalence of the human adaptive substitution PB2-E627K, which is common during human infection with other H5N1 clades and a known virulence marker for avian influenza viruses during human infections. In addition, the antigenic profile of these Indonesian HPAI H5N1 viruses was determined using serological analysis and antigenic cartography. Antigenic characterization showed two distinct antigenic clusters, as observed previously for avian isolates. These two antigenic clusters were not clearly associated with time of virus isolation. This study provides better insight in genetic diversity of H5N1 viruses during human infection and the presence of human adaptive markers. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating virus genetics for HPAI H5N1 viruses to estimate the risk to human health and the need for increased efforts to monitor the evolution of H5N1 viruses across Indonesia.","Pawestri HA, Nugraha AA, Han AX, Pratiwi E, Parker E, Richard M, van der Vliet S, Fouchier RAM, Muljono DH, de Jong MD, Setiawaty V, Eggink D",Virus Genes,2020 Aug,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia

This study was conducted to detect outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 in endemically infected regions by enhanced passive surveillance, to describe the clinical manifestation of these outbreaks and identify associated risk factors. From November 2015 to November 2016, HPAI outbreak investigations were conducted in seven districts of West Java. In total 64 outbreaks were confirmed out of 75 reported suspicions and outbreak characteristics were recorded. The highest mortality was reported in backyard chickens (average 59%, CI(95%): 49-69%). Dermal apoptosis and lesions (64%, CI(95)(%): 52-76%) and respiratory signs (39%, CI(95)(%): 27-51%) were the clinical signs observed overall most frequently, while neurological signs were most frequently observed in ducks (68%, CI(95)(%): 47-90%). In comparison with 60 non-infected control farms, the rate of visitor contacts onto a farm was associated with the odds of HPAI infection. Moreover, duck farms had higher odds of being infected than backyard farms, and larger farms had lower odds than small farms. Results indicate that better external biosecurity is needed to reduce transmission of HPAI A(H5N1) in Indonesia.","Karo-Karo D, Pribadi ES, Sudirman FX, Kurniasih SW, Indasari I, Muljono DH, Koch G, Stegeman JA",Microorganisms,2019 Sep 6,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
22574738,Phylodynamics of H5N1 avian influenza virus in Indonesia.,"Understanding how pathogens invade and become established in novel host populations is central to the ecology and evolution of infectious disease. Influenza viruses provide unique opportunities to study these processes in nature because of their rapid evolution, extensive surveillance, large data sets and propensity to jump species boundaries. H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) is a major animal pathogen and public health threat. The virus is of particular importance in Indonesia, causing severe outbreaks among poultry and sporadic human infections since 2003. However, little is known about how H5N1 HPAIV emerged and established in Indonesia. To address these questions, we analysed Indonesian H5N1 HPAIV gene sequences isolated during 2003-2007. We find that the virus originated from a single introduction into East Java between November 2002 and October 2003. This invasion was characterized by an initially rapid burst of viral genetic diversity followed by a steady rate of lineage replacement and the maintenance of genetic diversity. Several antigenic sites in the haemagglutinin gene were subject to positive selection during the early phase, suggesting that host-immune-driven selection played a role in host adaptation and expansion. Phylogeographic analyses show that after the initial invasion of H5N1, genetic variants moved both eastwards and westwards across Java, possibly involving long-distance transportation by humans. The phylodynamics we uncover share similarities with other recently studied viral invasions, thereby shedding light on the ecological and evolutionary processes that determine disease emergence in a new geographical region.","Lam TT, Hon CC, Lemey P, Pybus OG, Shi M, Tun HM, Li J, Jiang J, Holmes EC, Leung FC",Mol Ecol,2012 Jun,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia

Therefore, the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics against H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus is considered a public health priority. In the United States, three H5N1 vaccines derived from earlier strains of HPAI H5N1 (A/Vietnam, clade 1, and A/Indonesia, clade 2.1) virus, with (MF59 or AS03) or without adjuvants, are licensed and stockpiled for pre-pandemic preparedness, but whether they can elicit neutralizing antibodies against circulating H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses is unknown. In this study, we evaluated the binding, hemagglutination inhibition and neutralizing antibody response generated after vaccination of adults with the three licensed vaccines. Individuals vaccinated with the two adjuvanted licensed H5N1 vaccines generated cross-reactive binding and cross-neutralizing antibodies against the HPAI clade 2.3.4.4b A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 virus. Seroconversion rates of 60-95% against H5 clade 2.3.4.4b were observed after two doses of AS03-adjuvanted-A/Indonesia or three doses of MF59-adjuvanted-A/Vietnam vaccine. These findings suggest that the stockpiled US-licensed adjuvanted H5N1 vaccines generate cross-neutralizing antibodies against circulating HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b in humans and may be useful as bridging vaccines until updated H5N1 vaccines become available.","Khurana S, King LR, Manischewitz J, Posadas O, Mishra AK, Liu D, Beigel JH, Rappuoli R, Tsang JS, Golding H",Nat Med,2024 Oct,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
33246672,Long-lasting heterologous antibody responses after sequential vaccination with A/Indonesia/5/2005 and A/Vietnam/1203/2004 pre-pandemic influenza A(H5N1) virus vaccines.,"BACKGROUND: Avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses have caused sporadic infections in humans and thus they pose a significant global health threat. Among symptomatic patients the case fatality rate has been ca. 50%. H5N1 viruses exist in multiple clades and subclades and several candidate vaccines have been developed to prevent A(H5N1) infection as a principal measure for preventing the disease. METHODS: Serum antibodies against various influenza A(H5N1) clade viruses were measured in adults by ELISA-based microneutralization and haemagglutination inhibition tests before and after vaccination with two different A(H5N1) vaccines in 2009 and 2011. RESULTS: Two doses of AS03-adjuvanted A/Indonesia/5/2005 vaccine induced good homologous but poor heterologous neutralizing antibody responses against different clade viruses. However, non-adjuvanted A/Vietnam/1203/2004 booster vaccination in 2011 induced very strong and long-lasting homologous and heterologous antibody responses while homologous response remained weak in naive subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Sequential vaccination with two different A(H5N1) pre-pandemic vaccines induced long-lasting high level cross-clade immunity against influenza A(H5N1) strains, thus supporting a prime-boost vaccination strategy in pandemic preparedness plans.","Haveri A, Ikonen N, Savolainen-Kopra C, Julkunen I",Vaccine,2021 Jan 8,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
23524326,Vaccination of gallinaceous poultry for H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza: current questions and new technology.,"Vaccination of poultry for avian influenza virus (AIV) is a complex topic as there are numerous technical, logistic and regulatory aspects which must be considered. Historically, control of high pathogenicity (HP) AIV infection in poultry has been accomplished by eradication and stamping out when outbreaks occur locally. Since the H5N1 HPAIV from Asia has spread and become enzootic, vaccination has been used on a long-term basis by some countries to control the virus, other countries have used it temporarily to aid eradication efforts, while others have not used it at all. Currently, H5N1 HPAIV is considered enzootic in China, Egypt, Viet Nam, India, Bangladesh and Indonesia. All but Bangladesh and India have instituted vaccination programs for poultry. Importantly, the specifics of these programs differ to accommodate different situations, resources, and industry structure in each country. The current vaccines most commonly used are inactivated whole virus vaccines, but vectored vaccine use is increasing.

36298771,Phylodynamics of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus Circulating in Indonesian Poultry.,"After its first detection in 1996, the highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5Nx) virus has spread extensively worldwide. HPAIv A(H5N1) was first detected in Indonesia in 2003 and has been endemic in poultry in this country ever since. However, Indonesia has limited information related to the phylodynamics of HPAIv A(H5N1) in poultry. The present study aimed to increase the understanding of the evolution and temporal dynamics of HPAIv H5N1 in Indonesian poultry between 2003 and 2016. To this end, HPAIv A(H5N1) hemagglutinin sequences of viruses collected from 2003 to 2016 were analyzed using Bayesian evolutionary analysis sampling trees. Results indicated that the common ancestor of Indonesian poultry HPAIv H5N1 arose approximately five years after the common ancestor worldwide of HPAI A(H5Nx). In addition, this study indicated that only two introductions of HPAIv A(H5N1) occurred, after which these viruses continued to evolve due to extensive spread among poultry. Furthermore, this study revealed the divergence of H5N1 clade 2.3.2.1c from H5N1 clade 2.3.2.1b. Both clades 2.3.2.1c and 2.3.2.1b share a common ancestor, clade 1, suggesting that clade 2.3.2.1 originated and diverged from China and other Asian countries. Since there was limited sequence and surveillance data for the HPAIv A(H5N1) from wild birds in Indonesia, the exact role of wild birds in the spread of HPAIv in Indonesia is currently unknown. The evolutionary dynamics of the Indonesian HPAIv A(H5N1) highlight the importance of continuing and improved genomic surveillance and adequate control measures in the different regions of both the poultry and wild birds. Spatial genomic surveillance is useful to take adequate control measures. Therefore, it will help to prevent the future evolution of HPAI A(H5N1) and pandemic threats.","Karo-Karo D, Bodewes R, Restuadi R, Bossers A, Agustiningsih A, Stegeman JA, Koch G, Muljono DH",Viruses,2022 Oct 8,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia

Human influenza sustained by H5N1 virus is usually characterized by a severe lower respiratory tract infection, leading to a progressive respiratory failure and several extra-respiratory complications. Infected birds have been the primary source of influenza H5N1 infection in humans in Asia, but transmission from poultry to humans is very limited at present, and requires a direct exposure to live birds, whereas there was no significant risk related to eating well-cooked poultry meat. Human-to-human transmission of H5N1 virus has been suggested in several household clusters, but it seems very uncommon at present. All the viral genes of human H5N1 isolates were of avian influenza origin, which indicates absence of reassortment with human influenza viruses, but H5N1 continue to evolve and persistent monitoring is requested to identify any increase in viral adaptation to man, which could lead to a human pandemic.","Calza L, Manfredi R, Chiodo F",Recenti Prog Med,2005 Nov,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
31749584,Immunopathological immunohistochemical study of low pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 infection in lovebirds (Agapornis spp.) in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: To date, persistent infection with low pathogenic avian influenza virus (AIV) subtype H5N1 (LPAI H5N1) in chickens is widespread in Indonesia. Commercially available ornamental birds on markets play an important role in triggering the occurrence of AIV outbreaks. Thus, the presence of AIV in ornamental birds such as lovebirds needs to be closely monitored. Here, the presence of LPAI H5N1 was investigated in lovebirds with no clinical signs that, although apparently healthy, can be a continuous source of AIV transmission to other sensitive birds such as chickens and even humans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, 30 lovebirds were necropsied. The immunopathology of the lungs, which had hemorrhages, was immunohistochemically studied using the streptavidin-biotin (SB) method to stain for LPAI H5N1. Polyclonal antibodies against the nucleoprotein or monoclonal antibodies against the hemagglutinin of the AIV subtype H5N1 were used to identify these antigens in lung tissue samples. RESULTS: LPAI H5N1 was detected in the lungs of all lovebirds according to the brownish colored deposits in the histological samples. The highest intensity of the SB staining was found in the lumina of vascular capillaries and the cell membranes of air capillaries. The discovery of LPAI H5N1 in lovebirds increases the environmental health risk and raises the possibility of exposure to AIV. Thus, it is very important to improve the mechanisms that control the traffic of ornamental birds between regions and islands, as well as the AIV vaccination strategies related to the prevention, control, and eradication of AIV in Indonesia, and these procedures should be reevaluated. CONCLUSION: The present study proves that lovebirds are infected with LPAI subtype H5N1. Even if ornamental birds such as lovebirds do not show any clinical signs, they are likely to be a persistently infected with LPAI H5N1. Therefore, ornamental birds might be a continuous source of LPAI H5N1 infections in other sensitive birds, including poultry, and may also be responsible for virus transmission to humans.","Zulfikhar Z, Wasito R, Wuryastuti H",Vet World,2019 Sep,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
19288052,A comparison of the pathogenicity of avian and swine H5N1 influenza viruses in Indonesia.,"Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses are circulating in many countries. We recently discovered that these viruses have been transmitted to pigs on multiple occasions in Indonesia. To investigate whether avian H5N1 influenza viruses adapted to mammals through their introduction into pigs, we examined the growth of avian and swine isolates in cell culture and compared their pathogenicity in mice. We found that swine isolates were less virulent to mice than avian isolates, suggesting that the viruses became attenuated during their replication in pigs. Continuous surveillance of H5N1 viruses among pigs is clearly warranted.","Takano R, Nidom CA, Kiso M, Muramoto Y, Yamada S, Shinya K, Sakai-Tagawa Y, Kawaoka Y",Arch Virol,2009,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
38664271,Phylogeography and gene pool analysis of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses reported in India from 2006 to 2021.,"India has reported highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus outbreaks since 2006, with the first human case reported in 2021. These included viruses belonging to the clades 2.2, 2.2.2, 2.2.2.1, 2.3.2.1a, and 2.3.2.1c. There are currently no data on the gene pool of HPAI H5N1 viruses in India. Molecular clock and phylogeography analysis of the HA and NA genes; and phylogenetic analysis of the internal genes of H5N1 viruses from India were carried out. Sequences reported from 2006 to 2015; and sequences from 2021 that were available in online databases were used in the analysis. Five separate introductions of H5N1 viruses into India were observed, via Indonesia or Korea (2002), Bangladesh (2009), Bhutan (2010), and China (2013, 2018) (clades 2.2, 2.2.2, 2.2.2.1, 2.3.2.1a, 2.3.2.1c, and 2.3.4.4b). Phylogenetic analysis revealed eight reassortant genotypes. The H5N1 virus isolated from the human case showed a unique reassortant genotype. Amino acid markers associated with adaptation to mammals were also present. This is the first report of the spatio-temporal origins and gene pool analysis of H5N1 viruses from India, highlighting the need for increased molecular surveillance.","Tare DS, Keng SS, Walimbe AM, Pawar SD",Arch Virol,2024 Apr 25,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
19618617,Molecular epidemiology of H5N1 avian influenza.,"The highly pathogenic Asian H5N1 influenza virus that was first detected in Guangdong in the People's Republic of China (China) in 1996 is unique in having spread to humans and other mammalian species. To date, this virus has not consistently transmitted between any mammalian species but the continued spread and evolution of these viruses in domestic poultry across Eurasia presents a continuing pandemic threat. These viruses have caused devastation in domestic poultry and have killed over 60% of infected humans. The H5N1 viruses are unique in having evolved into multiple clades and subclades by reassortment with other influenza viruses in the epicentre of southern China, and accumulation of point mutations has resulted in antigenic differences between the clades. Three waves of spread have occurred, wave one to East Asia and Southeast Asia, wave two through Qinghai Lake, China, to Europe, India and Africa, and wave three to Southeast Asia again. This paper deals with the molecular epidemiology of the evolution of the multiplicity of H5N1 clades. The continuing evolution of these H5N1 viruses and the possible establishment of secondary epicentres in Indonesia, Egypt and Nigeria present a continuing threat to poultry and people globally.","Guan Y, Smith GJ, Webby R, Webster RG",Rev Sci Tech,2009 Apr,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
19884910,H5N1 influenza viruses: outbreaks and biological properties.,"All known subtypes of influenza A viruses are maintained in wild waterfowl, the natural reservoir of these viruses. Influenza A viruses are isolated from a variety of animal species with varying morbidity and mortality rates. More importantly, influenza A viruses cause respiratory disease in humans with potentially fatal outcome. Local or global outbreaks in humans are typically characterized by excess hospitalizations and deaths. In 1997, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of the H5N1 subtype emerged in Hong Kong that transmitted to humans, resulting in the first documented cases of human death by avian influenza virus infection. A new outbreak started in July 2003 in poultry in Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand, and highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza viruses have since spread throughout Asia and into Europe and Africa. These viruses continue to infect humans with a high mortality rate and cause worldwide concern of a looming pandemic. Moreover, H5N1 virus outbreaks have had devastating effects on the poultry industries throughout Asia. Since H5N1 virus outbreaks appear to originate from Southern China, we here examine H5N1 influenza viruses in China, with an emphasis on their biological properties.","Neumann G, Chen H, Gao GF, Shu Y, Kawaoka Y",Cell Res,2010 Jan,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
29320563,Field effectiveness of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 vaccination in commercial layers in Indonesia.,"Although vaccination of poultry for control of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 has been practiced during the last decade in several countries, its effectiveness under field conditions remains largely unquantified. Effective HPAI vaccination is however essential in preventing incursions, silent infections and generation of new H5N1 antigenic variants. The objective of this study was to asses the level and duration of vaccine induced immunity in commercial layers in Indonesia. Titres of H5N1 haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies were followed in individual birds from sixteen flocks, age 18-68 week old (wo). The study revealed that H5N1 vaccination had highly variable outcome, including vaccination failures, and was largely ineffective in providing long lasting protective immunity. Flocks were vaccinated with seven different vaccines, administer at various times that could be grouped into three regimes: In regime A, flocks (n = 8) were vaccinated two or three times before 19 wo; in regime B (n = 2), two times before and once after 19 wo; and in regime C (n = 6) three to four times before and two to three times after 19 wo. HI titres in regime C birds were significantly higher during the entire observation period in comparison to titres of regime A or B birds, which also differed significantly from each other. The HI titres of individual birds in each flock differed significantly from birds in other flocks, indicating that the effectiveness of field vaccination was highly variable and farm related. Protective HI titres of >4log2, were present in the majority of flocks at 18 wo, declined thereafter at variable rate and only two regime C flocks had protective HI titres at 68 wo. Laboratory challenge with HPAIV H5N1 of birds from regime A and C flocks confirmed that protective immunity differed significantly between flocks vaccinated by these two regimes. The study revealed that effectiveness of the currently applied H5N1 vaccination could be improved and measures to achieve this are discussed.","Tarigan S, Wibowo MH, Indriani R, Sumarningsih S, Artanto S, Idris S, Durr PA, Asmara W, Ebrahimie E, Stevenson MA, Ignjatovic J",PLoS One,2018,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
31738584,Analysis of antibody response to an epitope in the haemagglutinin subunit 2 of avian influenza virus H5N1 for differentiation of infected and vaccinated chickens.,"The H5N1 subtype of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus has been circulating in poultry in Indonesia since 2003 and vaccination has been used as a strategy to eradicate the disease. However, monitoring of vaccinated poultry flocks for H5N1 infection by serological means has been difficult, as vaccine antibodies are not readily distinguishable from those induced by field viruses. Therefore, a test that differentiates infected and vaccinated animals (DIVA) would be essential. Currently, no simple and specific DIVA test is available for screening of a large number of vaccinated chickens. Several epitopes on E29 domain of the haemagglutinin H5N1 subunit 2 (HA2) have recently been examined for their antigenicity and potential as possible markers for DIVA in chicken. In this study, the potential of E29 as an antigen for DIVA was evaluated in detail. Three different forms of full-length E29 peptide, a truncated E29 peptide (E15), and a recombinant E29 were compared for their ability to detect anti-E29 antibodies. Preliminary ELISA experiments using mono-specific chicken and rabbit E29 sera, and a mouse monoclonal antibody revealed that the linear E29 peptide was the most antigenic. Further examination of the E29 antigenicity in ELISA, using several sera from experimentally infected or vaccinated chickens, revealed that the full-length E29 peptide had the greatest discrimination power between infected and vaccinated chicken sera while providing the least non-specific reaction. This study demonstrates the usefulness of the HPAI H5N1 HA2 E29 epitope as a DIVA antigen in HPAI H5N1-vaccinated and -infected chickens.RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS E29 (HA2 positions 488-516) epitope is antigenic in chickens.Antibodies to E29 are elicited following live H5N1 virus infection in chickens.E29 epitope is a potential DIVA antigen for use in ELISA.","Putri K, Wibowo MH, Tarigan S, Wawegama N, Ignjatovic J, Noormohammadi AH",Avian Pathol,2020 Apr,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia

21890223,Metapopulation dynamics and determinants of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks in Indonesian poultry.,"In 2008, the Indonesian Government implemented a revised village-level Participatory Disease Surveillance and Response (PDSR) program to gain a better understanding of both the magnitude and spatial distribution of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks in backyard poultry. To date, there has been considerable collection of data, but limited publically available analysis. This study utilizes data collected by the PDSR program between April 2008 and September 2010 for Java, Bali and the Lampung Province of Sumatra. The analysis employs hierarchical Bayesian occurrence models to quantify spatial and temporal dynamics in backyard HPAI infection reports at the District level in 90 day time periods, and relates the probability of HPAI occurrence to PDSR-reported village HPAI infection status and human and poultry density. The probability of infection in a District was assumed to be dependent on the status of the District in the previous 90 day time period, and described by either a colonization probability (the probability of HPAI infection in a District given there had not been infection in the previous 90 day time period) or a persistence probability (the probability of HPAI infection being maintained in the District from the previous to current 90 day period). Results suggest that the number of surveillance activities in a district had little relationship to outbreak occurrence probabilities, but human and poultry densities were found to have non-linear relationships to outbreak occurrence probabilities. We found significant spatial dependency among neighboring districts, indicating that there are latent spatial processes that are not captured by the covariates available for this study, but which nonetheless impact outbreak dynamics. The results of this work may help improve understanding of the seasonal nature of H5N1 in poultry and the potential role of poultry density in enabling endemicity to occur, as well as to assist the Government of Indonesia target scarce resources to regions and time periods when outbreaks of HPAI in poultry are most likely to occur.","Farnsworth ML, Fitchett S, Hidayat MM, Lockhart C, Hamilton-West C, Brum E, Angus S, Poermadjaja B, Pinto J",Prev Vet Med,2011 Dec 1,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
22238686,"Avian influenza H5N1 transmission in households, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: Disease transmission patterns are needed to inform public health interventions, but remain largely unknown for avian influenza H5N1 virus infections. A recent study on the 139 outbreaks detected in Indonesia between 2005 and 2009 found that the type of exposure to sources of H5N1 virus for both the index case and their household members impacted the risk of additional cases in the household. This study describes the disease transmission patterns in those outbreak households. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We compared cases (n = 177) and contacts (n = 496) in the 113 sporadic and 26 cluster outbreaks detected between July 2005 and July 2009 to estimate attack rates and disease intervals. We used final size household models to fit transmission parameters to data on household size, cases and blood-related household contacts to assess the relative contribution of zoonotic and human-to-human transmission of the virus, as well as the reproduction number for human virus transmission. The overall household attack rate was 18.3% and secondary attack rate was 5.5%. Secondary attack rate remained stable as household size increased. The mean interval between onset of subsequent cases in outbreaks was 5.6 days. The transmission model found that human transmission was very rare, with a reproduction number between 0.1 and 0.25, and the upper confidence bounds below 0.4. Transmission model fit was best when the denominator population was restricted to blood-related household contacts of index cases. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The study only found strong support for human transmission of the virus when a single large cluster was included in the transmission model. The reproduction number was well below the threshold for sustained transmission. This study provides baseline information on the transmission dynamics for the current zoonotic virus and can be used to detect and define signatures of a virus with increasing capacity for human-to-human transmission.","Aditama TY, Samaan G, Kusriastuti R, Sampurno OD, Purba W, Misriyah, Santoso H, Bratasena A, Maruf A, Sariwati E, Setiawaty V, Glass K, Lokuge K, Kelly PM, Kandun IN",PLoS One,2012,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia

18725937,Evolutionary and transmission dynamics of reassortant H5N1 influenza virus in Indonesia.,"H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses have seriously affected the Asian poultry industry since their recurrence in 2003. The viruses pose a threat of emergence of a global pandemic influenza through point mutation or reassortment leading to a strain that can effectively transmit among humans. In this study, we present phylogenetic evidences for the interlineage reassortment among H5N1 HPAI viruses isolated from humans, cats, and birds in Indonesia, and identify the potential genetic parents of the reassorted genome segments. Parsimony analyses of viral phylogeography suggest that the reassortant viruses may have originated from greater Jakarta and surroundings, and subsequently spread to other regions in the West Java province. In addition, Bayesian methods were used to elucidate the genetic diversity dynamics of the reassortant strain and one of its genetic parents, which revealed a more rapid initial growth of genetic diversity in the reassortant viruses relative to their genetic parent. These results demonstrate that interlineage exchange of genetic information may play a pivotal role in determining viral genetic diversity in a focal population. Moreover, our study also revealed significantly stronger diversifying selection on the M1 and PB2 genes in the lineages preceding and subsequent to the emergence of the reassortant viruses, respectively. We discuss how the corresponding mutations might drive the adaptation and onward transmission of the newly formed reassortant viruses.","Lam TT, Hon CC, Pybus OG, Kosakovsky Pond SL, Wong RT, Yip CW, Zeng F, Leung FC",PLoS Pathog,2008 Aug 22,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
32350224,Comparison of Virulence and Lethality in Mice for Avian Influenza Viruses of Two A/H5N1 and One A/H3N6 Isolated from Poultry during Year 2013-2014 in Indonesia.,"In Indonesia, the highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5N1 virus has become endemic and has been linked with direct transmission to humans. From 2013 to 2014, we isolated avian influenza A/H5N1 and A/H3N6 viruses from poultry in Indonesia. This study aimed to reveal their pathogenicity in mammals using a mouse model. Three of the isolates, Av154 of A/H5N1 clade 2.3.2.1c, Av240 of A/H5N1 clade 2.1.3.2b, and Av39 of A/H3N6, were inoculated into BALB/c mice. To assess morbidity and mortality, we measured body weight daily and monitored survival for 20 d. Av154- and Av240-infected mice lost 25% of their starting body weight by day 7, while Av39-infected mice did not. Most of the Av154-infected mice died on day 8, while the majority of the Av240-infected mice survived until day 20. A 50% mouse lethal dose was calculated to be 2.0 x 10(1) 50% egg infectious doses for Av154, 1.1 x 10(5) for Av240 and > 3.2 x 10(6) for Av39. The Av154 virus was highly virulent and lethal in mice without prior adaptation, suggesting its high pathogenic potential in mammals. The Av240 virus was highly virulent but modestly lethal, whereas the Av39 virus was neither virulent nor lethal. Several mammalian adaptive markers of amino acid residues were associated with the highly virulent and lethal phenotypes of the Av154 virus.","Yudhawati R, Prasetya RR, Dewantari JR, Nastri AM, Rahardjo K, Novianti AN, Amin M, Rantam FA, Poetranto ED, Wulandari L, Lusida MI, Soetjipto, Soegiarto G, Shimizu YK, Mori Y, Shimizu K",Jpn J Infect Dis,2020 Sep 24,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
25115493,Cross-immunity and age patterns of influenza A(H5N1) infection.,"The age distribution of influenza A(H5N1) cases reported during 2006-2013 varied substantially between countries. As well as underlying demographic profiles, it is possible that cross-immunity contributed to the age distribution of reported cases: seasonal influenza A(H1N1) and avian influenza A(H5N1) share the same neuraminidase subtype, N1. Using a mechanistic model, we measured the extent to which population age distribution and heterosubtypic cross-immunity could explain the observed age patterns in Cambodia, China, Egypt, Indonesia and Vietnam. Our results support experimental evidence that prior infection with H1N1 confers partial cross-immunity to H5N1, and suggest that more than 50% of spillover events did not lead to reported cases of infection as a result. We also identified age groups that have additional risk factors for influenza A(H5N1) not captured by demography or infection history.","Kucharski AJ, Edmunds WJ",Epidemiol Infect,2015 Apr,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
30131494,Attenuation of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses in Indonesia following the reassortment and acquisition of genes from low pathogenicity avian influenza A virus progenitors.,"The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus is endemic in Indonesian poultry and has caused sporadic human infection in Indonesia since 2005. Surveillance of H5N1 viruses in live bird markets (LBMs) during 2012 and 2013 was carried out to provide epidemiologic and virologic information regarding viral circulation and the risk of human exposure. Real-time RT-PCR of avian cloacal swabs and environmental samples revealed influenza A-positive specimens, which were then subjected to virus isolation and genomic sequencing. Genetic analysis of specimens collected at multiple LBMs in Indonesia identified both low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) A(H3N8) and HPAI A(H5N1) viruses belonging to clade 2.1.3.2a. Comparison of internal gene segments among the LPAI and HPAI viruses revealed that the latter had acquired the PB2, PB1, and NS genes from LPAI progenitors and other viruses containing a wild type (wt) genomic constellation. Comparison of murine infectivity of the LPAI A(H3N8), wt HPAI A(H5N1) and reassortant HPAI A(H5N1) viruses showed that the acquisition of LPAI internal genes attenuated the reassortant HPAI virus, producing a mouse infectivity/virulence phenotype comparable to that of the LPAI virus. Comparison of molecular markers in each viral gene segment suggested that mutations in PB2 and NS1 may facilitate attenuation. The discovery of an attenuated HPAI A(H5N1) virus in mice that resulted from reassortment may have implications for the capability of these viruses to transmit and cause disease. In addition, surveillance suggests that LBMs in Indonesia may play a role in the generation of reassortant A(H5) viruses and should be monitored.","Dharmayanti NLPI, Thor SW, Zanders N, Hartawan R, Ratnawati A, Jang Y, Rodriguez M, Suarez DL, Samaan G, Pudjiatmoko, Davis CT",Emerg Microbes Infect,2018 Aug 22,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia

21813198,Identifying risk factors of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1 subtype) in Indonesia.,"Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), subtype H5N1, was first officially reported in Indonesia in 2004. Since then the disease has spread and is now endemic in large parts of the country. This study investigated the statistical relationship between a set of risk factors and the presence or absence of HPAI in Indonesia during 2006 and 2007. HPAI was evaluated through participatory disease surveillance (PDS) in backyard village chickens (the study population), and risk factors included descriptors of people and poultry distribution (separating chickens, ducks and production sectors), poultry movement patterns and agro-ecological conditions. The study showed that the risk factors ""elevation"", ""human population density"" and ""rice cropping"" were significant in accounting for the spatial variation of the PDS-defined HPAI cases. These findings were consistent with earlier studies in Thailand and Vietnam. In addition ""commercial poultry population"", and two indicators of market locations and transport; ""human settlements"" and ""road length"", were identified as significant risk factors in the models. In contrast to several previous studies carried out in Southeast Asia, domestic backyard ducks were not found to be a significant risk factor in Indonesia. The study used surrogate estimates of market locations and marketing chains and further work should focus on the actual location of the live bird markets, and on the flow of live poultry and poultry products between them, so that patterns of possible transmission, and regions of particular risk could be better inferred.","Loth L, Gilbert M, Wu J, Czarnecki C, Hidayat M, Xiao X",Prev Vet Med,2011 Oct 1,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
33176722,Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells attenuate pulmonary inflammation and lung damage caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5N1 virus in BALB/c mice.,"BACKGROUND: The highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5N1 virus is one of the causative agents of acute lung injury (ALI) with high mortality rate. Studies on therapeutic administration of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in ALI caused by the viral infection have been limited in number and have shown conflicting results. The aim of the present investigation is to evaluate the therapeutic potential of MSC administration in A/H5N1-caused ALI, using a mouse model. METHODS: MSCs were prepared from the bone marrow of 9 to 12 week-old BALB/c mice. An H5N1 virus of A/turkey/East Java/Av154/2013 was intranasally inoculated into BALB/c mice. On days 2, 4, and 6 after virus inoculation, MSCs were intravenously administered into the mice. To evaluate effects of the treatment, we examined for lung alveolar protein as an indicator for lung injury, PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio for lung functioning, and lung histopathology. Expressions of NF-kappaB, RAGE (transmembrane receptor for damage associated molecular patterns), TNFalpha, IL-1beta, Sftpc (alveolar cell type II marker), and Aqp5+ (alveolar cell type I marker) were examined by immunohistochemistry. In addition, body weight, virus growth in lung and brain, and duration of survival were measured. RESULTS: The administration of MSCs lowered the level of lung damage in the virus-infected mice, as shown by measuring lung alveolar protein, PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, and histopathological score. In the MSC-treated group, the expressions of NF-kappaB, RAGE, TNFalpha, and IL-1beta were significantly suppressed in comparison with a mock-treated group, while those of Sftpc and Aqp5+ were enhanced. Body weight, virus growth, and survival period were not significantly different between the groups. CONCLUSION: The administration of MSCs prevented further lung injury and inflammation, and enhanced alveolar cell type II and I regeneration, while it did not significantly affect viral proliferation and mouse morbidity and mortality. The results suggested that MSC administration was a promissing strategy for treatment of acute lung injuries caused by the highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5N1 virus, although further optimization and combination use of anti-viral drugs will be obviously required to achieve the goal of reducing mortality.","Yudhawati R, Amin M, Rantam FA, Prasetya RR, Dewantari JR, Nastri AM, Poetranto ED, Wulandari L, Lusida MI, Koesnowidagdo S, Soegiarto G, Shimizu YK, Mori Y, Shimizu K",BMC Infect Dis,2020 Nov 11,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia

However, vaccination of poultry was added as a control tool in 1995 and has been used during five epizootics. Over 113 billion doses of AI vaccine have been used in poultry from 2002 to 2010 as oil-emulsified, inactivated whole AIV vaccines (95.5%) and live vectored vaccines (4.5%). Over 99% of the vaccine has been used in the four H5N1 HPAI enzootic countries: China including Hong Kong (91%), Egypt (4.7%), Indonesia (2.3%), and Vietnam (1.4%) where vaccination programs have been nationwide and routine to all poultry. Ten other countries used vaccine in poultry in a focused, risk-based manner but this accounted for less than 1% of the vaccine used. Most vaccine ""failures"" have resulted from problems in the vaccination process; i.e., failure to adequately administer the vaccine to at-risk poultry resulting in lack of population immunity, while fewer failures have resulted from antigenic drift of field viruses away from the vaccine viruses. It is currently not feasible to vaccinate wild birds against H5N1 HPAI, but naturally occurring infections with H5 low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses may generate cross-protective immunity against H5N1 HPAI. The most feasible method to prevent and control H5N1 HPAI in wild birds is through control of the disease in poultry with use of vaccine to reduce environmental burden of H5N1 HPAIV, and eventual eradication of the virus in domestic poultry, especially in domestic ducks which are raised in enzootic countries on range or in other outdoor systems having contact with wild aquatic and periurban terrestrial birds.","Swayne DE, Spackman E, Pantin-Jackwood M",Ecohealth,2014,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
23402099,Impact of vaccines and vaccination on global control of avian influenza.,"There are 30 recorded epizootics of H5 or H7 high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) from 1959 to early 2012. The largest of these epizootics, affecting more birds and countries than the other 29 epizootics combined, has been the H5N1 HPAI, which began in Guangdong China in 1996, and has killed or resulted in culling of over 250 million poultry and/or wild birds in 63 countries. Most countries have used stamping-out programs in poultry to eradicate H5N1 HPAI. However, 15 affected countries have utilized vaccination as a part of the control strategy. Greater than 113 billion doses were used from 2002 to 2010. Five countries have utilized nationwide routine vaccination programs, which account for 99% of vaccine used: 1) China (90.9%), 2) Egypt (4.6%), 3) Indonesia (2.3%), 4) Vietnam (1.4%), and 5) Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (< 0.01%). Mongolia, Kazakhstan, France, The Netherlands, Cote d'Ivoire, Sudan, North Korea, Israel, Russia, and Pakistan used < 1% of the avian influenza (AI) vaccine, and the AI vaccine was targeted to either preventive or emergency vaccination programs. Inactivated AI vaccines have accounted for 95.5% of vaccine used, and live recombinant virus vaccines have accounted for 4.5% of vaccine used. The latter are primarily recombinant Newcastle disease vectored vaccine with H5 influenza gene insert. China, Indonesia, Egypt, and Vietnam implemented vaccination after H5N1 HPAI became enzootic in domestic poultry. Bangladesh and eastern India have enzootic H5N1 HPAI and have not used vaccination in their control programs. Clinical disease and mortality have been prevented in chickens, human cases have been reduced, and rural livelihoods and food security have been maintained by using vaccines during HPAI outbreaks. However, field outbreaks have occurred in vaccinating countries, primarily because of inadequate coverage in the target species, but vaccine failures have occurred following antigenic drift in field viruses within China, Egypt, Indonesia, Hong Kong, and Vietnam. The primary strategy for HPAI and H5/H7 low pathogenicity notifiable avian influenza control will continue to be immediate eradication using a four-component strategy: 1) education, 2) biosecurity, 3) rapid diagnostics and surveillance, and 4) elimination of infected poultry. Under some circumstances, vaccination can be added as an additional tool within a wider control strategy when immediate eradication is not feasible, which will maintain livelihoods and food security, and control clinical disease until a primary strategy can be developed and implemented to achieve eradication.",Swayne DE,Avian Dis,2012 Dec,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
27581388,Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H5N1) Virus in Feathers.,"H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus causes high mortality of infected birds, with infection in multiple organs, including in feathers. Feathers have been proposed as samples for diagnosis of HPAI infection in birds, and this study is part of a broader investigation validating the use of feathers for diagnostic purposes. To understand and characterize the morphological basis for feather infection, sections from 7 different skin tracts of ducks and chickens infected with 3 different clades of H5N1 HPAI virus from Indonesia and Vietnam were examined histologically. Results showed that in ducks, lesions and viral antigen were mainly detected in the epidermis of feathers and follicles, whereas in chickens, they were mostly found in the dermis of these structures. Abundant viral antigen was found in nearly all the feathers examined from chickens, and there was no apparent difference between virus isolates or skin tracts in the proportion of feathers that were antigen positive. By immunohistochemistry, the majority of feathers from most skin tracts from ducks infected with a Vietnamese H5N1 HPAI virus contained abundant levels of viral antigen, while few feathers were antigen positive from ducks infected with 2 Indonesian viruses. These results support and inform the use of feathers for diagnostic detection of H5N1 HPAI virus in birds.","Nuradji H, Bingham J, Payne J, Harper J, Lowther S, Wibawa H, Long NT, Meers J",Vet Pathol,2017 Mar,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
25224284,"Community preparedness for highly pathogenic Avian influenza on Bali and Lombok, Indonesia.","INTRODUCTION: The Asia-Pacific region is the likeliest location for the next significant outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Indonesia has experienced HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in poultry and humans each year since 2003 and has had the highest case fatality rate for human cases. The purposes of this study were to capture the knowledge of avian influenza and of poultry-raising practices in two regions of Indonesia and to evaluate the impact and extent of activities undertaken to 2010 through the National Strategic Plan for Avian Influenza Control at the village level. METHODS: A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods was used to investigate the multiple influences on behaviours, decisions and actions taken by poultry-raising households, and by villages and communities, regarding the threat of HPAI. Between June 2010 and May 2011 a structured survey of 400 households was conducted on Lombok and of 402 on Bali, inviting Sector 3 (small-scale independent commercial poultry farms) and Sector 4 (village household) poultry raisers to participate. Focus groups and in-depth interviews were convened with key stakeholders, including livestock and animal health and public health officials, community leaders and villagers. RESULTS: From the focus group and in-depth interviews, it appears that the flow of information through the national HPAI control program has been efficient at the top levels (from national to provincial, then to districts and subdistricts). However, these findings show that effective transmission of information from subdistrict to rural village level and from village leaders to community members has been limited. The degree of community preparedness for HPAI on Bali and Lombok appears minimal. Knowledge of government activities was more extensive at Bali sites, while only limited government programs and activities occurred at the village level on Lombok. Activities conducted by government agencies from provincial to village level were limited in scope and need to be further developed to ensure safe poultry-handling practices and biosecurity measures. On both Bali and Lombok, community respondents knew the signs and symptoms of sick birds but did not differentiate well between HPAI and other bird diseases. On both islands, more than 60% of respondents were reluctant to report sudden deaths of poultry. The lack of a government compensation program for destroyed flocks contributed to this unwillingness to report. CONCLUSIONS: While the Indonesian government's planning efforts for HPAI are commendable, the plan has not been effective, as it depends on the cooperative actions of people with small rural farms who have not been consulted in the development of the plan, have not been adequately instructed on the nature of the plan, and perceive no benefits to themselves from prevention efforts. Context-appropriate mechanisms for communicating zoonotic risk and options for risk mitigation that do not result in net loss to poor households are also needed.","Hunter C, Birden HH, Toribio JA, Booy R, Abdurrahman M, Ambarawati AI, Adiputra N",Rural Remote Health,2014,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
25244310,Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus Outbreak Investigation: Application of the FAO-OIE-WHO Four-way Linking Framework in Indonesia.,"WHO, FAO and OIE developed a 'four-way linking' framework to enhance the cross-sectoral sharing of epidemiological and virological information in responding to zoonotic disease outbreaks. In Indonesia, outbreak response challenges include completeness of data shared between human and animal health authorities. The four-way linking framework (human health laboratory/epidemiology and animal health laboratory/epidemiology) was applied in the investigation of the 193 rd human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection. As recommended by the framework, outbreak investigation and risk assessment findings were shared. On 18 June 2013, a hospital in West Java Province reported a suspect H5N1 case in a 2-year-old male. The case was laboratory-confirmed that evening, and the information was immediately shared with the Ministry of Agriculture. The human health epidemiology/laboratory team investigated the outbreak and conducted an initial risk assessment on 19 June. The likelihood of secondary cases was deemed low as none of the case contacts were sick. By 3 July, no secondary cases associated with the outbreak were identified. The animal health epidemiology/laboratory investigation was conducted on 19-25 June and found that a live bird market visited by the case was positive for H5N1 virus. Once both human and market virus isolates were sequenced, a second risk assessment was conducted jointly by the human health and animal health epidemiology/laboratory teams. This assessment concluded that the likelihood of additional human cases associated with this outbreak was low but that future sporadic human infections could not be ruled out because of challenges in controlling H5N1 virus contamination in markets. Findings from the outbreak investigation and risk assessments were shared with stakeholders at both Ministries. The four-way linking framework clarified the type of data to be shared. Both human health and animal health teams made ample data available, and there was cooperation to achieve risk assessment objectives.","Setiawaty V, Dharmayanti NL, Misriyah, Pawestri HA, Azhar M, Tallis G, Schoonman L, Samaan G",Zoonoses Public Health,2015 Aug,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
16713612,Evolution and adaptation of H5N1 influenza virus in avian and human hosts in Indonesia and Vietnam.,"Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 is endemic in poultry in East and Southeast Asia with disease outbreaks recently spreading to parts of central Asia, Europe and Africa. Continued interspecies transmission to humans has been reported in Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia and China, causing pandemic concern. Here, we genetically characterize 82 H5N1 viruses isolated from poultry throughout Indonesia and Vietnam and 11 human isolates from southern Vietnam together with sequence data available in public databases to address questions relevant to virus introduction, endemicity and evolution. Phylogenetic analysis shows that all viruses from Indonesia form a distinct sublineage of H5N1 genotype Z viruses suggesting this outbreak likely originated from a single introduction that spread throughout the country during the past two years. Continued virus activities in Indonesia were attributed to transmission via poultry movement within the country rather than through repeated introductions by bird migration. Within Indonesia and Vietnam, H5N1 viruses have evolved over time into geographically distinct groups within each country. Molecular analysis of the H5N1 genotype Z genome shows that only the M2 and PB1-F2 genes were under positive selection, suggesting that these genes might be involved in adaptation of this virus to new hosts following interspecies transmission. At the amino acid level 12 residues were under positive selection in those genotype Z viruses, in the HA and PB1-F2 proteins. Some of these residues were more frequently observed in human isolates than in avian isolates and are related to viral antigenicity and receptor binding. Our study provides insight into the ongoing evolution of H5N1 influenza viruses that are transmitting in diverse avian species and at the interface between avian and human hosts.","Smith GJ, Naipospos TS, Nguyen TD, de Jong MD, Vijaykrishna D, Usman TB, Hassan SS, Nguyen TV, Dao TV, Bui NA, Leung YH, Cheung CL, Rayner JM, Zhang JX, Zhang LJ, Poon LL, Li KS, Nguyen VC, Hien TT, Farrar J, Webster RG, Chen H, Peiris JS, Guan Y",Virology,2006 Jul 5,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
22016499,"Risk factors for cluster outbreaks of avian influenza A H5N1 infection, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: By 30 July 2009, Indonesia had reported 139 outbreaks of avian influenza (AI) H5N1 infection in humans. Risk factors for case clustering remain largely unknown. This study assesses risk factors for cluster outbreaks and for secondary case infection. METHODS: The 113 sporadic and 26 cluster outbreaks were compared on household and individual level variables. Variables assessed include those never reported previously, including household size and genealogical relationships between cases and their contacts. RESULTS: Cluster outbreaks had larger households and more blood-related contacts, especially first-degree relatives, compared with sporadic case outbreaks. Risk factors for cluster outbreaks were the number of first-degree blood-relatives to the index case (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20-1.86) and index cases having direct exposure to sources of AI H5N1 virus (aOR, 3.20; 95% CI: 1.15-8.90). Risk factors for secondary case infection were being aged between 5 and 17 years (aOR, 8.32; 95% CI: 1.72-40.25), or 18 and 30 years (aOR, 6.04; 95% CI: 1.21-30.08), having direct exposure to sources of AI H5N1 virus (aOR, 3.48; 95% CI: 1.28-9.46), and being a first-degree relative to an index case (aOR, 11.0; 95% CI: 1.43-84.66). Siblings to index cases were 5 times more likely to become secondary cases (OR, 4.72; 95% CI: 1.67-13.35). CONCLUSIONS: The type of exposure and the genealogical relationship between index cases and their contacts impacts the risk of clustering. The study adds evidence that AI H5N1 infection is influenced by, and may even depend on, host genetic susceptibility.","Aditama TY, Samaan G, Kusriastuti R, Purba WH, Misriyah, Santoso H, Bratasena A, Maruf A, Sariwati E, Setiawaty V, Cook AR, Clements MS, Lokuge K, Kelly PM, Kandun IN",Clin Infect Dis,2011 Dec,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
27298195,The Intersection of Care Seeking and Clinical Capacity for Patients With Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Virus in Indonesia: Knowledge and Treatment Practices of the Public and Physicians.,"BACKGROUND: Indonesia has the highest human mortality from highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A (H5N1) virus infection in the world. METHODS: A survey of households (N=2520) measured treatment sources and beliefs among symptomatic household members. A survey of physicians (N=554) in various types of health care facilities measured knowledge, assessment and testing behaviors, and perceived clinical capacity. RESULTS: Households reported confidence in health care system capacity but infrequently sought treatment for potential HPAI H5N1 signs/symptoms. More clinicians were confident in their knowledge of diagnosis and treatment than in the adequacy of related equipment and resources at their facilities. Physicians expressed awareness of the HPAI H5N1 suspect case definition, yet expressed only moderate knowledge in questioning symptomatic patients about exposures. Self-reported likelihood of testing for HPAI H5N1 virus was high after learning of certain exposures. Knowledge of antiviral treatment was moderate, but it was higher among clinicians in puskesmas. Physicians in private outpatient clinics, the most heavily used facilities, reported the lowest confidence in their diagnostic and treatment capabilities. CONCLUSIONS: Educational campaigns can encourage recall of possible poultry exposure when patients are experiencing signs/symptoms and can raise awareness of the effectiveness of antivirals to drive people to seek health care. Clinicians may benefit from training regarding exposure assessment and referral procedures, particularly in private clinics.

36897923,Evolution of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A virus in the central nervous system of ferrets.,"Central nervous system (CNS) disease is the most common extra-respiratory tract complication of influenza A virus infections in humans. Remarkably, zoonotic highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus infections are more often associated with CNS disease than infections with seasonal influenza viruses. Evolution of avian influenza viruses has been extensively studied in the context of respiratory infections, but evolutionary processes in CNS infections remain poorly understood. We have previously observed that the ability of HPAI A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1) virus to replicate in and spread throughout the CNS varies widely between individual ferrets. Based on these observations, we sought to understand the impact of entrance into and replication within the CNS on the evolutionary dynamics of virus populations. First, we identified and characterized three substitutions-PB1 E177G and A652T and NP I119M - detected in the CNS of a ferret infected with influenza A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1) virus that developed a severe meningo-encephalitis. We found that some of these substitutions, individually or collectively, resulted in increased polymerase activity in vitro. Nevertheless, in vivo, the virus bearing the CNS-associated mutations retained its capacity to infect the CNS but showed reduced dispersion to other anatomical sites. Analyses of viral diversity in the nasal turbinate and olfactory bulb revealed the lack of a genetic bottleneck acting on virus populations accessing the CNS via this route. Furthermore, virus populations bearing the CNS-associated mutations showed signs of positive selection in the brainstem. These features of dispersion to the CNS are consistent with the action of selective processes, underlining the potential for H5N1 viruses to adapt to the CNS.","Siegers JY, Ferreri L, Eggink D, Veldhuis Kroeze EJB, Te Velthuis AJW, van de Bildt M, Leijten L, van Run P, de Meulder D, Bestebroer T, Richard M, Kuiken T, Lowen AC, Herfst S, van Riel D",PLoS Pathog,2023 Mar,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia

METHODS: We reviewed the case records of patients admitted to the Persahabatan Hospital (RSP), Jakarta, Indonesia, with influenza A(H5N1) confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Twenty-two previously well patients, aged 3 to 47 years (median 24.5 years), were identified. All attended a clinic or hospital after a median of 2 days of illness (range 0-7). Times to first dose of oseltamivir (three died before receiving oseltamivir) were 2 to 12 days (median 7 days), administered mostly (n = 15) at RSP. Nineteen patients required mechanical ventilation. Deaths numbered 18 (case fatality = 82%) occurring within hours to 6 days of RSP admission, corresponding to 6 to 16 days of illness. Admission hyperglycemia ( >or= 140 mg/dL), unrelated to steroids or known underlying diabetes mellitus, and elevated D-dimer levels (0.81-5.2 mg/L, upper limit of normal < 0.5 mg/L) were present in 14/21 (67%) and 20/21 (95%) patients, respectively. Fibrinogen concentrations were mostly low/normal at 129.9 to 517.9 mg/dL (median 241.1, normal 200-400 mg/dL), whereas C-reactive protein (9/11) and ferritin (6/8) levels were increased. Risk factors for death (univariate analysis) included: (1) increased D-dimers, (2) hyperglycema, (3) increased urea, (4) more extensive chest radiograph shadowing, and (5) lower admission oxygen saturation. CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis and effective treatment of human influenza A(H5N1) infection remains challenging. Most patients were referred late with advanced disease. Oseltamivir had limited clinical impact. Elevated D-dimer levels, consistent with fibrinolysis, and hyperglycemia warrant more research to determine their underlying mechanisms and optimal treatment.","Soepandi PZ, Burhan E, Mangunnegoro H, Nawas A, Aditama TY, Partakusuma L, Isbaniah F, Ikhsan M, Swidarmoko B, Sutiyoso A, Malik S, Benamore R, Baird JK, Taylor WR",Chest,2010 Sep,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia

27923953,Seroevidence for a High Prevalence of Subclinical Infection With Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus Among Workers in a Live-Poultry Market in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND:  In Indonesia, highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus has become endemic in poultry and has caused sporadic deadly infections in human. Since 2012, we have conducted fixed-point surveillance of avian influenza viruses at a live-poultry market in East Java, Indonesia. In this study, we examined the seroprevalence of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection among market workers. METHODS:  Sera were collected from 101 workers in early 2014 and examined for antibody activity against avian A(H5N1) Eurasian lineage virus by a hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assay. RESULTS:  By the HI assay, 84% of the sera tested positive for antibody activity against the avian virus. Further analysis revealed that the average HI titer in 2014 was 2.9-fold higher than in 2012 and that seroconversion occurred in 44% of paired sera (11 of 25) between 2012 and 2014. A medical history survey was performed in 2016; responses to questionnaires indicated that none of workers had had severe acute respiratory illness during 2013. CONCLUSIONS:  This study provides evidence of a high prevalence of avian A(H5N1) virus infection in 2013 among workers at a live-poultry market. However, because no instances of hospitalizations were reported, we can conclude the virus did not manifest any clinical symptoms in workers.","Shimizu K, Wulandari L, Poetranto ED, Setyoningrum RA, Yudhawati R, Sholikhah A, Nastri AM, Poetranto AL, Candra AY, Puruhito EF, Takahara Y, Yamagishi Y, Yamaoka M, Hotta H, Ustumi T, Lusida MI, Soetjipto, Shimizu YK, Soegiarto G, Mori Y",J Infect Dis,2016 Dec 15,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia

Despite ongoing circulation of the virus, no human infection had been identified by December 2005. OBJECTIVES: To assess behavioral patterns associated with poultry rearing in Bali, and to identify potential risk factors for H5N1 infection in humans and in household chickens, ducks and pigs. METHODS: A behavioral, virological and seroepidemiologic survey in 38 villages and three live bird markets was completed in December 2005. A multi-stage cluster design was used to select 291 households with 841 participants from all nine districts in Bali. Specimens were collected from participants as well as a maximum of three pigs, chickens and ducks from each household. Eighty-seven market vendors participated, where specimens were collected from participants as well as chickens and ducks. RESULTS: Twenty out of the 38 villages sampled had H5N1 outbreaks. Despite exposure to H5N1 outbreaks, none of the participants from villages or markets were seropositive for H5N1. None of the pigs tested were positive for H5N1. Virus isolation rate in ducks and chicken in markets was higher than in households. Transport of poultry in or out of villages was a risk factor for outbreaks in household chickens and ducks. CONCLUSIONS: The study highlighted that the market chain and associated behaviors may play a role in maintaining the virus in household flocks. The study adds evidence that transmission of H5N1 to humans remains a rare event despite high level handling of both healthy and sick birds.","Santhia K, Ramy A, Jayaningsih P, Samaan G, Putra AA, Dibia N, Sulaimin C, Joni G, Leung CY, Sriyal J, Peiris M, Wandra T, Kandun N",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,2009 May,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
29657407,Intranasal administration of inactivated avian influenza virus of H5N1 subtype vaccine-induced systemic immune response in chicken and mice.,"AIM: The need for non-parenteral administration of inactivated avian influenza virus of H5N1 subtype (AIV-H5N1) vaccine is paramount. Here, we provide preliminary data on the immune response of chicken and mice after intranasal administration of AIV-H5N1-inactivated vaccine with ISCOMS, Inmunair (INM), and combined ISCOMS and INM as an adjuvant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The AIV isolate of A/Chicken/Denpasar/01/2004 (H5N1) was cultivated in specific pathogen-free chicken eggs and inactivated with formaldehyde. The vaccine preparation was added with those adjuvants for intranasal administration and aluminum hydroxide for subcutaneous injection. The chicken and mouse were vaccinated at the age of 3 weeks or 1 month and repeated 2 weeks thereafter. In one experiment, chicken was injected with Newcastle disease virus (NDV) at the same time with AIV vaccine. The sera were collected at one (serum 1) and 2 w (serum 2) after booster vaccination. The anti-AIV-H5 and NDV antibodies in chicken sera were detected using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. Mouse IgG anti-AIV-H5N1 antibody was detected using ELISA. RESULTS: The result shows that the geometric mean titers (GMTs) of chicken sera of intranasal vaccinated with inactivated AIV-H5N1 vaccine with mixed ISCOM- INM as adjuvant were <2(0.0) and 2(2.7) unit HI-unit (HIU) in serum 1 and serum 2, respectively. The GMTs of the positive control group were 2(3.7) and 2(5.7) HIU in serum 1 and serum 2, respectively. The result of the second experiment shows that IgG anti-AIV-H5N1 was detected in mouse sera. In the third experiment, the GMTs of anti-NDV in chicken vaccinated subsequently with inactivated NDV vaccine and AIV-H5N1 with mixed ISCOMS-INM administrated intranasally and aluminum hydroxide adjuvant administrated through subcutaneous injection as well as positive control group receiving NDV vaccine only were 2(8.0), 2(8.0), and 2(7.4) HIU in serum 1 while were 2(9.6), 2(9.2), and 2(8.2) HIU in serum 2, respectively. CONCLUSION: Intranasal administration of inactivated AIV-H5N1 vaccine-induced a systemic immune response in chicken and mice after adding ISCOMS and/or INM as adjuvants. The adjuvant and the intranasal administration caused no immunosuppressive effect on the chicken immune response to NDV vaccine.","Suartha IN, Suartini GAA, Wirata IW, Dewi NMARK, Putra GNN, Kencana GAY, Mahardika GN",Vet World,2018 Feb,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
18618060,"Towards mutual trust, transparency and equity in virus sharing mechanism: the avian influenza case of Indonesia.","INTRODUCTION: As the country hardest hit by avian influenza, both in poultry and in human, Indonesia's decision to withhold samples of avian influenza virus A (H5N1) has fired up a global controversy. The objective of this paper is to describe the position taken by Indonesia in the events leading to the decision and in those conducted to resolve the situation. METHODS: The sources for this paper are the Indonesian human influenza A(H5N1) case reports and study results, summaries, minutes and reports of national and international meetings of virus sharing, and other related Indonesian and WHO documents. RESULTS: The International Health Regulations 2005 have been applied in different ways based on different interpretations. While one party insists on the importance of free, non-conditional, virus sharing for risk assessment and risk response, Indonesia--as supported by most of the developing countries--stresses on the more basic principles such as sovereignty of a country over its biological materials, transparency of the global system, and equity between developed and developing nations.

27814377,Antibody Persistence and Booster Responses to Split-Virion H5N1 Avian Influenza Vaccine in Young and Elderly Adults.,"Avian influenza continues to circulate and remains a global health threat not least because of the associated high mortality. In this study antibody persistence, booster vaccine response and cross-clade immune response between two influenza A(H5N1) vaccines were compared. Participants aged over 18-years who had previously been immunized with a clade 1, A/Vietnam vaccine were re-immunized at 6-months with 7.5 mug of the homologous strain or at 22-months with a clade 2, alum-adjuvanted, A/Indonesia vaccine. Blood sampled at 6, 15 and 22-months after the primary course was used to assess antibody persistence. Antibody concentrations 6-months after primary immunisation with either A/Vietnam vaccine 30 mug alum-adjuvanted vaccine or 7.5 mug dose vaccine were lower than 21-days after the primary course and waned further with time.

21606531,"Dose-sparing H5N1 A/Indonesia/05/2005 pre-pandemic influenza vaccine in adults and elderly adults: a phase III, placebo-controlled, randomized study.","BACKGROUND: Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses remain a threat to human health, with potential to become pandemic agents. METHODS: This phase III, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded study evaluated the immunogenicity, cross-reactivity, safety, and lot consistency of 2 doses of oil-in-water (AS03(A)) adjuvanted H5N1 A/Indonesia/05/2005 (3.75 mug hemagglutinin antigen) prepandemic candidate vaccine in 4561 adults aged 18-91 years. RESULTS: Humoral antibody responses in the H5N1 vaccine groups fulfilled US and European immunogenicity licensure criteria for pandemic vaccines in all age strata 21 days after the second dose. At 6 months after the administration of the primary dose, serum antibody seroconversion rates continued to fulfill licensure criteria. Neutralizing cross-clade immune responses were demonstrated against clade 1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004. Consistency was demonstrated for 3 consecutive H5N1 vaccine lots. Temporary injection-site pain was more frequent with H5N1 vaccine than placebo (89.3% and 70.7% in the 18-64 and >/=65 years strata vs 22.2% and 14.4% in the placebo groups). Unsolicited adverse event frequency, including medically attended and serious events, was similar between groups through day 364. CONCLUSIONS: In adults and elderly adults, AS03(A)-adjuvanted H5N1 candidate vaccine was highly immunogenic for A/Indonesia/05/2005, with cross-reactivity against A/Vietnam/1194/2004.

23000130,Flagellin-HA vaccines protect ferrets and mice against H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) infections.,"In order to meet the global demand for rapid production of pandemic influenza vaccines, we have developed a recombinant fusion vaccine platform in which the globular head of hemagglutinin (HA) antigen is genetically fused to bacterial flagellin (a TLR5 ligand). These flagellin-HA fusion vaccine candidates elicit highly protective immunity against a lethal challenge with 2009 pandemic H1N1 (Liu, et al. PLoS ONE 2011; 6:e20928) or H5N1 influenza A/Vietnam/1203/04 (A/VN) infections in mice (Song, et al. Vaccine 2009;27:5875-88). Here we provide the first evidence showing that two A/VN vaccine candidates elicited HA-specific IgG, reduced nasal virus shedding, and conferred full protection against a lethal A/VN infection in ferrets. Furthermore, we show that similar flagellin-HA vaccine candidates of two other H5N1 HPAIV are immunogenic and/or efficacious in mice. Vaccines of A/Indonesia/5/05 (A/IN) induced significant HAI titers to homologous and heterologous A/Anhui/1/05 (A/AN) H5N1 viruses. Two subcutaneous immunizations with doses of either 0.3 mug or 3 mug of A/IN candidates resulted in >/= 2.5 log(10) unit reduction in day 5 lung virus titer and 90-100% protection against a lethal A/IN challenge in mice. Both R3.HA5 IN and R3.2xHA5 IN vaccines elicited robust neutralizing antibody responses that last for at least 9 months and demonstrated a significant anamnestic antibody response upon further booster immunization. Finally, we found that two vaccine candidates of A/AN induced significant HAI titers in mice. Taken together, our recombinant flagellin-HA platform has been successfully used to generate potent H5N1 HPAIV vaccine candidates. These promising preclinical results justify the advancement of these candidates into the clinic.","Liu G, Song L, Reiserova L, Trivedi U, Li H, Liu X, Noah D, Hou F, Weaver B, Tussey L",Vaccine,2012 Nov 6,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
26462759,"A comparative evaluation of feathers, oropharyngeal swabs, and cloacal swabs for the detection of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus infection in experimentally infected chickens and ducks.","Oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs have been widely used for the detection of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian Influenza A virus (HPAI virus) in birds. Previous studies have shown that the feather calamus is a site of H5N1 virus replication and therefore has potential for diagnosis of avian influenza. However, studies characterizing the value of feathers for this purpose are not available, to our knowledge; herein we present a study investigating feathers for detection of H5N1 virus. Ducks and chickens were experimentally infected with H5N1 HPAI virus belonging to 1 of 3 clades (Indonesian clades 2.1.1 and 2.1.3, Vietnamese clade 1). Different types of feathers and oropharyngeal and cloacal swab samples were compared by virus isolation. In chickens, virus was detected from all sample types: oral and cloacal swabs, and immature pectorosternal, flight, and tail feathers. During clinical disease, the viral titers were higher in feathers than swabs. In ducks, the proportion of virus-positive samples was variable depending on viral strain and time from challenge; cloacal swabs and mature pectorosternal feathers were clearly inferior to oral swabs and immature pectorosternal, tail, and flight feathers. In ducks infected with Indonesian strains, in which most birds did not develop clinical signs, all sampling methods gave intermittent positive results; 3-23% of immature pectorosternal feathers were positive during the acute infection period; oropharyngeal swabs had slightly higher positivity during early infection, while feathers performed better during late infection. Our results indicate that immature feathers are an alternative sample for the diagnosis of HPAI in chickens and ducks.","Nuradji H, Bingham J, Lowther S, Wibawa H, Colling A, Long NT, Meers J",J Vet Diagn Invest,2015 Nov,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
23731554,Estimating the transmissibility of H5N1 and the effect of vaccination in Indonesia.,"The spread of H5N1 avian influenza continues to pose an economic burden and a public health risk worldwide. Despite this, estimates of the transmissibility of infection exist in only a handful of settings and vary considerably. Using final size methods and flock-level infection data from a field trial of mass vaccination, we obtained the first estimates of the transmissibility of infection between and within flocks in Indonesia. We also found that outbreaks in areas designated as vaccination zones were less transmissible than in non-vaccination zones. However, this reduction is only comparable with a limited degree of protective vaccination coverage. Quantifying the overall effect of vaccination in these zones remains challenging. However, this result would appear to imply that, although the interventions applied in vaccination zones were not sufficient to completely prevent transmission in all areas, when outbreaks occur, they are less transmissible than those in areas where vaccination was not applied. This could be either a direct or an indirect effect of vaccination. Given the dynamism of small-scale poultry production in Indonesia, more regular vaccination may be required to ensure that infection is fully controlled in vaccination zones.","Walker PG, Jost C, Ghani AC, Cauchemez S, Bett B, Azhar M, Murahman J, Widiastuti T, Daju D, Mariner J",Transbound Emerg Dis,2015 Apr,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
24374323,An aptamer that binds efficiently to the hemagglutinins of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (H5N1 and H7N7) and inhibits hemagglutinin-glycan interactions.,"Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5 and H7 viruses have ravaged the poultry industry in numerous countries in Asia, Europe, Africa and the Middle East, and have resulted in the deaths of millions of birds. Although HPAI H5N1 viruses currently remain avian viruses, they are continuously evolving and have the potential to become pandemic-type viruses capable of human-human transmission. To develop specific reagents to allow better preparedness against this threat, we selected an aptamer (8-3) from a completely random RNA pool that binds with high affinity ( approximately  KD 170pM) to the hemagglutinins (HAs) derived from HPAI H5N1 (A/H5N1/Vietnam/1194/2004 and A/H5N1/Indonesia/05/2005) and H7N7 (A/H7N7/Netherlands/219/2003) influenza A viruses. Aptamer 8-3 was able to efficiently distinguish HAs derived from subtypes of influenza A virus other than H5 and H7. Aptamer 8-3 was analyzed further to assess its ability to interfere with HA-glycan interactions using our previously established SPR-based competitive assay, and we found that aptamer 8-3 efficiently interferes with HA-glycan binding (EC50  approximately  25 nM). To derive shorter variants for other applications, aptamer 8-3 was shortened to a 44-mer by deletion analyses. The shortened aptamer, 8-3S, retains the full-length aptamer's affinity and specificity for its cognate Has, and also interferes with HA-glycan interactions. These studies suggest that aptamer 8-3S should be studied further to explore its potential applications not only in surveillance and diagnosis, but also in the development of H5N1- and H7N7-specific virucidal products that interfere with virus-host interactions to contain future H5N1 and H7N7 pandemics.","Suenaga E, Kumar PK",Acta Biomater,2014 Mar,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
18216109,Identification of the progenitors of Indonesian and Vietnamese avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses from southern China.,"The transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus to Southeast Asian countries triggered the first major outbreak and transmission wave in late 2003, accelerating the pandemic threat to the world. Due to the lack of influenza surveillance prior to these outbreaks, the genetic diversity and the transmission pathways of H5N1 viruses from this period remain undefined. To determine the possible source of the wave 1 H5N1 viruses, we recently conducted further sequencing and analysis of samples collected in live-poultry markets from Guangdong, Hunan, and Yunnan in southern China from 2001 to 2004. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of 73 H5N1 isolates from this period revealed a greater genetic diversity in southern China than previously reported. Moreover, results show that eight viruses isolated from Yunnan in 2002 and 2003 were most closely related to the clade 1 virus sublineage from Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia, while two viruses from Hunan in 2002 and 2003 were most closely related to viruses from Indonesia (clade 2.1). Further phylogenetic analyses of the six internal genes showed that all 10 of those viruses maintained similar phylogenetic relationships as the surface genes. The 10 progenitor viruses were genotype Z and shared high similarity (>/=99%) with their corresponding descendant viruses in most gene segments. These results suggest a direct transmission link for H5N1 viruses between Yunnan and Vietnam and also between Hunan and Indonesia during 2002 and 2003. Poultry trade may be responsible for virus introduction to Vietnam, while the transmission route from Hunan to Indonesia remains unclear.","Wang J, Vijaykrishna D, Duan L, Bahl J, Zhang JX, Webster RG, Peiris JS, Chen H, Smith GJ, Guan Y",J Virol,2008 Apr,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
28483200,A systematic review and meta-analysis of cross-reactivity of antibodies induced by oil-in-water emulsion adjuvanted influenza H5N1 virus monovalent vaccines.,"BACKGROUND: Cross-clade immunogenic stockpiled H5N1 vaccines may decrease the morbidity and transmission of infection during the initial phase of influenza pandemic. Meta-analysis of cross-reactive antibodies induced by oil-in-water emulsion adjuvanted (OWEA) influenza H5N1 virus monovalent vaccines with circulating heterologous H5N1 virus strains, isolated from human infections was performed. METHODS: Literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, The Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number registry was conducted up through December 1, 2015. Methodologically qualified studies were included for (1) use of two doses of licensed OWEA (AS03 or MF59) egg-derived, inactivated influenza H5N1 virus monovalent vaccine, (2) participant age between 18 and 64years, and (3) evaluation of immunogenicity outcome for one or more subclade. Meta-analysis assessed the cross-reactivity of antibodies elicited by clade 1 adjuvanted vaccine strain against clade 2.1 virus strain (A/Vietnam/1194/2004 vs. A/Indonesia/05/2005); and separately against clade 2.2 virus strain (A/Vietnam/1194/2004 vs. A/turkey/Turkey/1/05); and clade 2.1 adjuvanted vaccine strain against clade 1 virus strain (A/Indonesia/05/2005 vs. A/Vietnam/1194/2004). Quantitative publication bias and influence analysis was conducted to evaluate potential impact of unpublished or new studies on the robustness of meta-analysis. RESULTS: Of 960 articles, 53 qualified for quality assessment and 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. All assessed clade pairs elicited cross-reactive antibodies (clade 1 against clade 2.1 and 2.2; clade 2.1 against clade 1, 2.2, and 2.3). Heterologous strains of same sub-clade are likely to elicit higher cross-reactive antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: OWEA influenza H5N1 virus monovalent vaccines exhibit broad cross-clade immunogenicity, a desired feature for vaccine stockpiling not yet demonstrated by unadjuvanted vaccines. In case of an impending H5N1 virus pandemic, stockpiled OWEA influenza H5N1 virus monovalent vaccines may allow population priming that could slow down the course of pandemic and could offer additional time needed for development of an effective strain specific vaccine supply.","Chada KE, Forshee R, Golding H, Anderson S, Yang H",Vaccine,2017 May 31,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
25609805,Antibody titer has positive predictive value for vaccine protection against challenge with natural antigenic-drift variants of H5N1 high-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses from Indonesia.,"Vaccines are used in integrated control strategies to protect poultry against H5N1 high-pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI). H5N1 HPAI was first reported in Indonesia in 2003, and vaccination was initiated in 2004, but reports of vaccine failures began to emerge in mid-2005. This study investigated the role of Indonesian licensed vaccines, specific vaccine seed strains, and emerging variant field viruses as causes of vaccine failures. Eleven of 14 licensed vaccines contained the manufacturer's listed vaccine seed strains, but 3 vaccines contained a seed strain different from that listed on the label. Vaccines containing A/turkey/Wisconsin/1968 (WI/68), A/chicken/Mexico/28159-232/1994 (Mex/94), and A/turkey/England/N28/1973 seed strains had high serological potency in chickens (geometric mean hemagglutination inhibition [HI] titers, >/= 1:169), but vaccines containing strain A/chicken/Guangdong/1/1996 generated by reverse genetics (rg; rgGD/96), A/chicken/Legok/2003 (Legok/03), A/chicken/Vietnam/C57/2004 generated by rg (rgVN/04), or A/chicken/Legok/2003 generated by rg (rgLegok/03) had lower serological potency (geometric mean HI titers, </= 1:95). In challenge studies, chickens immunized with any of the H5 avian influenza vaccines were protected against A/chicken/West Java/SMI-HAMD/2006 (SMI-HAMD/06) and were partially protected against A/chicken/Papua/TA5/2006 (Papua/06) but were not protected against A/chicken/West Java/PWT-WIJ/2006 (PWT/06). Experimental inactivated vaccines made with PWT/06 HPAI virus or rg-generated PWT/06 low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) virus seed strains protected chickens from lethal challenge, as did a combination of a commercially available live fowl poxvirus vaccine expressing the H5 influenza virus gene and inactivated Legok/03 vaccine. These studies indicate that antigenic variants did emerge in Indonesia following widespread H5 avian influenza vaccine usage, and efficacious inactivated vaccines can be developed using antigenic variant wild-type viruses or rg-generated LPAI virus seed strains containing the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of wild-type viruses. IMPORTANCE: H5N1 high-pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) virus has become endemic in Indonesian poultry, and such poultry are the source of virus for birds and mammals, including humans. Vaccination has become a part of the poultry control strategy, but vaccine failures have occurred in the field. This study identified possible causes of vaccine failure, which included the use of an unlicensed virus seed strain and induction of low levels of protective antibody because of an insufficient quantity of vaccine antigen. However, the most important cause of vaccine failure was the appearance of drift variant field viruses that partially or completely overcame commercial vaccine-induced immunity. Furthermore, experimental vaccines using inactivated wild-type virus or reverse genetics-generated vaccines containing the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of wild-type drift variant field viruses were protective. These studies indicate the need for surveillance to identify drift variant viruses in the field and update licensed vaccines when such variants appear.","Swayne DE, Suarez DL, Spackman E, Jadhao S, Dauphin G, Kim-Torchetti M, McGrane J, Weaver J, Daniels P, Wong F, Selleck P, Wiyono A, Indriani R, Yupiana Y, Sawitri Siregar E, Prajitno T, Smith D, Fouchier R",J Virol,2015 Apr,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
25915110,Characterization of the M2e antibody response following highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus infection and reliability of M2e ELISA for identifying infected among vaccinated chickens.,"A surveillance method able to differentiate between vaccinated and infected poultry is required for those countries that practice vaccination against highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1. The external domain of the M2 protein (M2e) of influenza virus is a potentially useful differentiating-infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) antigen but little is known about the M2e antibody response and factors influencing its detection. In this study, the M2e antibody response was characterized in layer birds vaccinated and challenged with an Indonesian H5N1 virus isolate, using a single M2e peptide or four-branched multiple antigenic peptide form of M2e (MAP-M2e) as antigens in two separate ELISAs. Anti-M2e antibodies were absent in chicks with high level of maternal haemagglutination inhibition antibodies and also in all layers vaccinated once, twice or three times with an inactivated commercial H5N1 vaccine. In contrast, anti-M2e antibodies were detected in vaccinated layers challenged with H5N1 virus and their presence was associated with virus isolation and an increase in haemagglutination inhibition titres. The number of birds that developed M2e antibodies, as well as the strength and duration of the M2e antibody response were strongly influenced by the length of the interval between vaccination and challenge. Birds challenged at six weeks after vaccination all developed M2e antibodies by 14 days that lasted until at least 56 days after infection. In birds challenged at two weeks after vaccination, only a proportion of birds developed M2e antibodies by 14 days that lasted only until 28 days post-infection. Both single M2e peptide and MAP-M2e ELISAs had high diagnostic specificity but the diagnostic sensitivity of MAP-M2e ELISA was significantly higher and more effective in detecting M2e antibody in immune and infected birds. The results show that MAP-M2e ELISA would be useful for surveillance in countries using vaccination to control highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1.","Tarigan S, Indriani R, Durr PA, Ignjatovic J",Avian Pathol,2015,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia

The purpose of this clinical trial is to assess the safety and impact of rintatolimod on intranasal influenza vaccine in healthy adults. During Stage I of this Phase I/II clinical trial, 12 volunteers were immunized intranasally with 3 doses of FluMist seasonal influenza vaccine on Days 0, 28, and 56 followed by intranasal rintatolimod (50 mug, 200 mug, or 500 mug) 3 days later. Parotid saliva and nasal wash samples were collected at baseline and on Days 25, 53, 84, and 417. The samples were tested for IgA and IgG specific antibodies (Ab) directed against the homologous FluMist viral hemagglutinins (HAs). In addition, viral specific responses against influenza A HAs were tested for IgA Ab cross-reactivity against 3 H5 clades: HA (H5N1) A/Indonesia/5/2005, HA (H5N1) A/Hong Kong/483/97 and HA (H5N1) A/Vietnam/1194/2004, as well as, two H7 strains, HA (H7N9) A/Shanghai/2/2013 and HA (H7N3) A/chicken/Jalisco/CPA1. The combination of the intranasal FluMist along with the rintatolimod generated specific secretory IgA responses of at least 4-fold over baseline against at least one of the homologous vaccine strains included in the vaccine in 92% of the vaccinees. Additionally, this vaccination strategy induced cross-reactive secretory IgA against highly pathogenic avian influenza virus strains H5N1, H7N9, and H7N3 with pandemic potential for humans. The combination of rintatolimod and FluMist was well-tolerated.","Overton ET, Goepfert PA, Cunningham P, Carter WA, Horvath J, Young D, Strayer DR",Vaccine,2014 Sep 22,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia

26900963,Intersubtype Reassortments of H5N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Viruses Isolated from Quail.,"H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses are considered a threat to national animal industries, causing production losses and high mortality in domestic poultry. In recent years, quail has become a popular terrestrial poultry species raised for production of meat and eggs in Asia. In this study, to better understand the roles of quail in H5N1 viral evolution, two H5N1-positive samples, designated A/quail/Vietnam/CVVI-49/2010 (CVVI-49/2010) and A/quail/Vietnam/CVVI-50/2014 (CVVI-50/2014), were isolated from quail during H5N1 outbreaks in Vietnam, and their whole genome were analyzed. The phylogenetic analysis reveals new evolutionary variation in the worldwide H5N1 viruses. The quail HA genes were clustered into clades 1.1.1 (CVVI-49/2010) and clade 2.3.2.1c (CVVI-50/2014), which may have evolved from viruses circulating from chickens and/or ducks in Cambodia, mainland of China, Taiwan, Indonesia, and South Korea in recent years. Interestingly, the M2 gene of the CVVI-49/2010 strain contained amino acid substitutions at position 26L-I and 31S-N that are related to amantadine-resistance. In particular, the CVVI-50/2014 strain revealed evidence of multiple intersubtype reassortment events between virus clades 2.3.2.1c, 2.3.2.1b, and 2.3.2.1a. Data from this study supports the possible role of quail as an important intermediate host in avian influenza virus evolution. Therefore, additional surveillance is needed to monitor these HPAI viruses both serologically and virologically in quail.","Nguyen TH, Than VT, Thanh HD, Hung VK, Nguyen DT, Kim W",PLoS One,2016,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
24439035,"Assessing the risk of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 transmission through poultry movements in Bali, Indonesia.","Indonesia continues to report the highest number of human and poultry cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1. The disease is considered to be endemic on the island of Bali. Live bird markets are integral in the poultry supply chain on Bali and are important, nutritionally and culturally, for the rural and urban human populations. Due to the lack of biosecurity practiced along the supply chain from producer to live bird markets, there is a need to understand the risks associated with the spread of H5N1 through live bird movements for effective control. Resources to control H5N1 in Indonesia are very limited and cost effective strategies are needed. We assessed the probability a live bird market is infected through live poultry movements and assessed the effects of implementing two simple and low cost control measures on this risk. Results suggest there is a high risk a live bird market is infected (0.78), and risk mitigation strategies such as detecting and removing infected poultry from markets reduce this risk somewhat (range 0.67-0.76). The study demonstrates the key role live poultry movements play in transmitting H5N1 and the need to implement a variety of control measures to reduce disease spread.","Roche SE, Cogger N, Garner MG, Putra AA, Toribio JA",Prev Vet Med,2014 Mar 1,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia

For this purpose 14 pigeons were infected ocularly and nasally with 10(8) EID50 and clinical signs were recorded and compared with five chickens infected simultaneously as positive controls. The chickens demonstrated anorexia, depression, and 100% mortality within 2 days postinoculation. Three of the pigeons died after a history of depression and severe neurological signs consisting of paresis to paralysis, mild enteric hemorrhage, resulting in a mortality of 21%. Gross lesions in these pigeons were mild and inconsistent. Occasionally subcutaneous hyperemia and hemorrhage and cerebral malacia were observed. Microscopic lesions and detection of viral antigen were confined to the central nervous system of these pigeons. In the cerebrum and to a minor extent in the brain stem a lymphohistiocytic meningoencephalitis with disseminated neuronal and glial cell necrosis, perivascular cuffing, glial nodules, and in one bird focally extensive liquefactive necrosis could be observed. The remaining nine pigeons showed neither clinical signs nor gross or histological lesions associated with avian influenza, although seroconversion against H5 indicated that they had been infected. These results confirm that pigeons are susceptible to HPAIV A/chicken/Indonesia/2003 (H5N1) and that the disease is associated with the neurotropism of this virus. Although sentinel chickens and most pigeons did not develop disease, further experiments have to elucidate whether or not Columbiformes are involved in transmission and spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza.","Klopfleisch R, Werner O, Mundt E, Harder T, Teifke JP",Vet Pathol,2006 Jul,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia

In addition, novel reassortant viruses were identified that emerged between this new sublineage and other clades in 2005-2006 on Java Island. H5N1 viruses were introduced from Java Island to Sulawesi, Kalimantan, and Sumatra Island on multiple occasions from 2003-2007, causing the geographical expansion of these viruses in Indonesia.

The proportion of fatal cases (PFC) for human A(H7N9) cases as of 11 August 2013 was 32%, compared to a cumulative PFC for A(H5N1) of 83% in Indonesia and 36% in Egypt. Approximately 75% of cases of all A(H7N9) cases occurred among individuals >45 years old. Morbidity and mortality from A(H7N9) are lowest among individuals between 10 and 29 years, the age group which exhibits the highest cumulative morbidity and case fatality rates from A(H5N1). Although individuals <20 years old comprise nearly 50% of all human A(H5N1) cases, only 7% of all reported A(H7N9) cases and no deaths have been reported among individuals in this age group. Only 4% of A(H7N9) cases occurred among children<5 years old, and only one case from the 10 to 20 year age group. Age- and sex-related differences in morbidity and mortality from emerging zoonotic diseases can provide insights into ecological, economic, and cultural factors that may contribute to the emergence and proliferation of novel zoonotic diseases in human populations.","Dudley JP, Mackay IM",J Clin Virol,2013 Nov,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia

We implemented enhanced surveillance in four outpatient clinics and six hospitals for HPAI H5N1 and seasonal influenza viruses in East Jakarta district to assess the public health impact of influenza in Indonesia. Epidemiological and clinical data were collected from outpatients with influenza-like illness (ILI) and hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI); respiratory specimens were obtained for influenza testing by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. During October 2011-September 2012, 1131/3278 specimens from ILI cases (34.5%) and 276/1787 specimens from SARI cases (15.4%) tested positive for seasonal influenza viruses. The prevalence of influenza virus infections was highest during December-May and the proportion testing positive was 76% for ILI and 36% for SARI during their respective weeks of peak activity. No HPAI H5N1 virus infections were identified, including hundreds of ILI and SARI patients with recent poultry exposures, whereas seasonal influenza was an important contributor to acute respiratory disease in East Jakarta. Overall, 668 (47%) of influenza viruses were influenza B, 384 (27%) were A(H1N1)pdm09, and 359 (25%) were H3. While additional data over multiple years are needed, our findings suggest that seasonal influenza prevention efforts, including influenza vaccination, should target the months preceding the rainy season.","Storms AD, Kusriastuti R, Misriyah S, Praptiningsih CY, Amalya M, Lafond KE, Samaan G, Triada R, Iuliano AD, Ester M, Sidjabat R, Chittenden K, Vogel R, Widdowson MA, Mahoney F, Uyeki TM",Epidemiol Infect,2015 Dec,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
20875275,"Influenza A (H5N1) viruses from pigs, Indonesia.","Pigs have long been considered potential intermediate hosts in which avian influenza viruses can adapt to humans. To determine whether this potential exists for pigs in Indonesia, we conducted surveillance during 2005-2009. We found that 52 pigs in 4 provinces were infected during 2005-2007 but not 2008-2009. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the viruses had been introduced into the pig population in Indonesia on at least 3 occasions. One isolate had acquired the ability to recognize a human-type receptor. No infected pig had influenza-like symptoms, indicating that influenza A (H5N1) viruses can replicate undetected for prolonged periods, facilitating avian virus adaptation to mammalian hosts. Our data suggest that pigs are at risk for infection during outbreaks of influenza virus A (H5N1) and can serve as intermediate hosts in which this avian virus can adapt to mammals.","Nidom CA, Takano R, Yamada S, Sakai-Tagawa Y, Daulay S, Aswadi D, Suzuki T, Suzuki Y, Shinya K, Iwatsuki-Horimoto K, Muramoto Y, Kawaoka Y",Emerg Infect Dis,2010 Oct,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia

HPAI H5N1 outbreaks have occurred in a variety of ecological systems with economic, agricultural and environmental differences. This review aimed to identify common risk factors amongst spatial modelling studies conducted in these different agro-ecological systems, and to identify gaps in our understanding of the disease's spatial epidemiology. Three types of variables with similar statistical association with HPAI H5N1 presence across studies and regions were identified: domestic waterfowl, several anthropogenic variables (human population density, distance to roads) and indicators of water presence. Variables on socio-economic conditions, poultry trade, wild bird distribution and movements were comparatively rarely considered. Few studies have analysed the HPAI H5N1 distribution in countries such as Egypt and Indonesia, where HPAIV H5N1 continues to circulate extensively.","Gilbert M, Pfeiffer DU",Spat Spatiotemporal Epidemiol,2012 Sep,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
27309060,Experimental and Field Results Regarding Immunity Induced by a Recombinant Turkey Herpesvirus H5 Vector Vaccine Against H5N1 and Other H5 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus Challenges.,"Vaccination against H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (AI) virus (HPAIV) is one of the possible complementary means available for affected countries to control AI when the disease has become, or with a high risk of becoming, endemic. Efficacy of the vaccination against AI relies essentially, but not exclusively, on the capacity of the vaccine to induce immunity against the targeted virus (which is prone to undergo antigenic variations), as well as its capacity to overcome interference with maternal immunity transmitted by immunized breeding hens to their progeny. This property of the vaccine is a prerequisite for its administration at the hatchery, which assures higher and more reliable vaccine coverage of the populations than vaccination at the farm. A recombinant vector vaccine (Vectormune(R) AI), based on turkey herpesvirus expressing the hemagglutinin gene of an H5N1 HPAIV as an insert, has been used in several experiments conducted in different research laboratories, as well as in controlled field trials. The results have demonstrated a high degree of homologous and cross protection against different genetic clades of the H5N1 HPAIV. Furthermore, vaccine-induced immunity was not impaired by the presence of passive immunity, but on the contrary, cumulated with it for improved early protection. The demonstrated levels of protection against the different challenge viruses exhibited variations in terms of postchallenge mortality, as well as challenge virus shedding. The data presented here highlight the advantages of this vaccine as a useful and reliable tool to complement biosecurity and sanitary policies for better controlling the disease due to HPAIV of H5 subtypes, when the vaccination is applied as a control measure.","Gardin Y, Palya V, Dorsey KM, El-Attrache J, Bonfante F, Wit Sd, Kapczynski D, Kilany WH, Rauw F, Steensels M, Soejoedono RD",Avian Dis,2016 May,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
20521631,"Summary of avian influenza activity in Europe, Asia, and Africa, 2006-2009.","Events during the period extending from 2006 to 2009 have been overshadowed by the ongoing panzootic with H5N1 (highly pathogenic notifiable avian influenza [HPNAI]), which has afflicted 63 countries and three continents (Africa, Asia, and Europe) during the review period. Two countries, Indonesia and Egypt, have formally declared the disease endemic to the World Organisation for Animal Health, while others have used a variety of approaches aimed at containment, control, and eradication. These approaches have achieved variable success, but in 2009 several countries that had previously declared themselves free of HPNAI became reinfected. In addition, the virus continued to be detected widely in wild bird populations, even in the absence of local poultry outbreaks. Other poultry outbreaks with HPNAI have been reported in South Africa (in ostriches with H5N2 in 2006) and the U.K. (in chickens with H7N7 in 2008). Also notable was the report of H5N2 HPNAI in wild bird populations in North Africa in 2007. Improved active surveillance systems and vigilance for notifiable avian influenza (NAI) in domestic poultry, especially in host groupings, in which clinical signs following infection may be inapparent (e.g., domestic waterfowl), have inevitably resulted in the detection and reporting of other activity. Low pathogenicity NAI H5 or H7 viruses were isolated/detected from poultry in Belgium (H5N2, 2008), Chinese Taipei (H5N2, 2008), Denmark (H5N2, 2006; H7N1, 2008), France (H5N2, 2007), Germany (H7N3, 2008), Italy (H7N7, 2006; H7N3, 2007-08), the Netherlands (H7N7, 2006), Portugal (H5N2, 2007; H5N3, 2007), the Republic of Korea (H7N8, 2007; H5N2, 2008), and the U.K. (H7N3, 2006; H7N2, 2007).

25359591,Immunogenicity and efficacy of fowlpox-vectored and inactivated avian influenza vaccines alone or in a prime-boost schedule in chickens with maternal antibodies.,"Inactivated and fowlpox virus (FP)-vectored vaccines have been used to control H5 avian influenza (AI) in poultry. In H5 AI endemic countries, breeder flocks are vaccinated and therefore, maternally-derived antibodies (MDA) are transferred to their progeny. Results of three immunogenicity and one efficacy studies performed in birds with or without MDA indicated that the immunogenicity of an inactivated vaccine based on a H5N9 AI isolate (inH5N9) was severely impaired in chicks hatched from inH5N9-vaccinated breeders. This MDA interference was lower when breeders received only one administration of the same vaccine and could be overcome by priming the chicks at day-of-age with a live recombinant FP-vectored vaccine with H5 avian influenza gene insert (FP-AI). The interference of anti-FP MDA was of lower intensity than the interference of anti-AI MDA. The highest interference observed on the prime-boost immunogenicity was in chicks hatched from breeders vaccinated with the same prime-boost scheme. The level of protection against an antigenic variant H5N1 highly pathogenic AI isolate from Indonesia against which the FP-AI or inH5N9 alone was poorly protective could be circumvented by the prime-boost regimen in birds with either FP or AI MDA. Thus, the immunogenicity of vaccines in young chicks with MDA depends on the vaccination scheme and the type of vaccine used in their parent flocks. The heterologous prime-boost in birds with MDA may at least partially overcome MDA interference on inactivated vaccine.","Richard-Mazet A, Goutebroze S, Le Gros FX, Swayne DE, Bublot M",Vet Res,2014 Oct 30,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
28715152,Demographic and ecological risk factors for human influenza A virus infections in rural Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Indonesia has the world's highest reported mortality for human infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus. Indonesia is an agriculturally driven country where human-animal mixing is common and provides a unique environment for zoonotic influenza A virus transmission. OBJECTIVES: To identify potential demographic and ecological risk factors for human infection with seasonal influenza A viruses in rural Indonesia, a population-based study was conducted in Cileunyi and Soreang subdistricts near Bandung in western Java from 2008 to 2011. METHODS: Passive influenza surveillance with RT-PCR confirmation of influenza A viral RNA in respiratory specimens was utilized for case ascertainment. A population census and mapping were utilized for population data collection. The presence of influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infections in a household was modeled using Generalized Estimating Equations. RESULTS: Each additional child aged <5 years in a household increased the odds of H3N2 approximately 5 times (OR=4.59, 95%CI: 3.30-6.24) and H1N1pdm09 by 3.5 times (OR=3.53, 95%CI: 2.51-4.96). In addition, the presence of 16-30 birds in the house was associated with an increased odds of H3N2 (OR=5.08, 95%CI: 2.00-12.92) and H1N1pdm09 (OR=12.51 95%CI: 6.23-25.13). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest an increase in influenza A virus infections in rural Indonesian households with young children and poultry.","Root ED, Agustian D, Kartasasmita C, Uyeki TM, Simoes EAF",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,2017 Sep,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
21203523,Preclinical and clinical development of plant-made virus-like particle vaccine against avian H5N1 influenza.,"The recent swine H1N1 influenza outbreak demonstrated that egg-based vaccine manufacturing has an Achille's heel: its inability to provide a large number of doses quickly. Using a novel manufacturing platform based on transient expression of influenza surface glycoproteins in Nicotiana benthamiana, we have recently demonstrated that a candidate Virus-Like Particle (VLP) vaccine can be generated within 3 weeks of release of sequence information. Herein we report that alum-adjuvanted plant-made VLPs containing the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of H5N1 influenza (A/Indonesia/5/05) can induce cross-reactive antibodies in ferrets. Even low doses of this vaccine prevented pathology and reduced viral loads following heterotypic lethal challenge. We further report on safety and immunogenicity from a Phase I clinical study of the plant-made H5 VLP vaccine in healthy adults 18-60 years of age who received 2 doses 21 days apart of 5, 10 or 20 microg of alum-adjuvanted H5 VLP vaccine or placebo (alum). The vaccine was well tolerated at all doses. Adverse events (AE) were mild-to-moderate and self-limited. Pain at the injection site was the most frequent AE, reported in 70% of vaccinated subjects versus 50% of the placebo recipients. No allergic reactions were reported and the plant-made vaccine did not significantly increase the level of naturally occurring serum antibodies to plant-specific sugar moieties. The immunogenicity of the H5 VLP vaccine was evaluated by Hemagglutination-Inhibition (HI), Single Radial Hemolysis (SRH) and MicroNeutralisation (MN). Results from these three assays were highly correlated and showed similar trends across doses. There was a clear dose-response in all measures of immunogenicity and almost 96% of those in the higher dose groups (2 x 10 or 20 microg) mounted detectable MN responses. Evidence of striking cross-protection in ferrets combined with a good safety profile and promising immunogenicity in humans suggest that plant-based VLP vaccines should be further evaluated for use in pre-pandemic or pandemic situations.

25734159,"Safety, Reactogenicity, and Immunogenicity of Inactivated Monovalent Influenza A(H5N1) Virus Vaccine Administered With or Without AS03 Adjuvant.","BACKGROUND: The national stockpile for influenza pandemic preparedness includes vaccines against an array of strains and adjuvants that could be utilized to induce immunologic priming as a pandemic wave emerges. We assessed the feasibility of a strategy that allows the flexibility of postmanufacture mixture of vaccine and adjuvant at the point of care. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial among healthy adults aged 18-49 years who received 2 doses of inactivated influenza A/Indonesia/05/2005 (H5N1 clade 2.2.3) virus vaccine containing either 3.75, 7.5, or 15 microg of hemagglutinin (HA) with or without AS03 adjuvant, administered 21 days apart. Subjects were observed for local (injection site) and systemic reactogenicity and adverse events. Sera were tested for hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and microneutralization (MN) antibody levels against the homologous strain and 4 heterologous avian strains. RESULTS: Vaccine containing ASO3 adjuvant was associated with significantly more local reactions compared with nonadjuvanted vaccine, but these were short-lived and resolved spontaneously. Although the immune response to nonadjuvanted vaccine was poor, 2 doses of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing as little as 3.75 microg of HA elicited robust immune responses resulting in seroprotective titers (>/=1:40) to the homologous strain in >/=86% of subjects by HAI and in 95% of subjects by MN. Cross-clade antibody responses were also observed with AS03-adjuvanted vaccine, but not nonadjuvanted vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: AS03 adjuvant formulated with inactivated vaccine at the administration site significantly enhanced the immune responses to H5N1 vaccine and has the potential to markedly improve vaccine responses and accelerate delivery during an influenza pandemic.

24643858,Experiences in participatory surveillance and community-based reporting systems for H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza: a case study approach.,"Participatory surveillance (PS) is the application of participatory rural appraisal methods to the collection of epidemiological information to inform decision-making and action. It was applied in Africa and Asia as part of emergency programs to address the H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) pandemic. The approach resulted in markedly increased case detection in countries experiencing HPAI, and a better understanding of the epidemiological situation. Where HPAI was absent and PS was implemented, the method did not result in false positives and contributed to the overall epidemiological assessment that the country was free of disease. It was noted that clarity of surveillance objectives and resulting data needs at the outset was essential to optimize the balance of surveillance methods, size of the program and costs. The quality of training programs and adherence to international guidelines on good PS training practice were important for assuring the competence of PS practitioners. Orientation of senior decision-makers was an important step in assuring effective program management and appropriate use of results. As a problem-solving methodology, PS is best used to rapidly assess situations and inform strategy. Several countries continued PS after the end of projects and went on to apply PS to other health challenges.","Mariner JC, Jones BA, Hendrickx S, El Masry I, Jobre Y, Jost CC",Ecohealth,2014,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
20585972,Persistence of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus defined by agro-ecological niche.,"The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus has spread across Eurasia and into Africa. Its persistence in a number of countries continues to disrupt poultry production, impairs smallholder livelihoods, and raises the risk a genotype adapted to human-to-human transmission may emerge. While previous studies identified domestic duck reservoirs as a primary risk factor associated with HPAI H5N1 persistence in poultry in Southeast Asia, little is known of such factors in countries with different agro-ecological conditions, and no study has investigated the impact of such conditions on HPAI H5N1 epidemiology at the global scale. This study explores the patterns of HPAI H5N1 persistence worldwide, and for China, Indonesia, and India includes individual provinces that have reported HPAI H5N1 presence during the 2004-2008 period. Multivariate analysis of a set of 14 agricultural, environmental, climatic, and socio-economic factors demonstrates in quantitative terms that a combination of six variables discriminates the areas with human cases and persistence: agricultural population density, duck density, duck by chicken density, chicken density, the product of agricultural population density and chicken output/input ratio, and purchasing power per capita. The analysis identifies five agro-ecological clusters, or niches, representing varying degrees of disease persistence. The agro-ecological distances of all study areas to the medoid of the niche with the greatest number of human cases are used to map HPAI H5N1 risk globally. The results indicate that few countries remain where HPAI H5N1 would likely persist should it be introduced.","Hogerwerf L, Wallace RG, Ottaviani D, Slingenbergh J, Prosser D, Bergmann L, Gilbert M",Ecohealth,2010 Jun,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
21859775,Avian and pandemic human influenza policy in South-East Asia: the interface between economic and public health imperatives.,"The aim of this study was to analyse the contemporary policies regarding avian and human pandemic influenza control in three South-East Asia countries: Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam. An analysis of poultry vaccination policy was used to explore the broader policy of influenza A H5N1 control in the region. The policy of antiviral stockpiling with oseltamivir, a scarce regional resource, was used to explore human pandemic influenza preparedness policy. Several policy analysis theories were applied to analyse the debate on the use of vaccination for poultry and stockpiling of antiviral drugs in each country case study. We conducted a comparative analysis across emergent themes. The study found that whilst Indonesia and Vietnam introduced poultry vaccination programmes, Thailand rejected this policy approach. By contrast, all three countries adopted similar strategic policies for antiviral stockpiling in preparation. In relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza, economic imperatives are of critical importance. Whilst Thailand's poultry industry is large and principally an export economy, Vietnam's and Indonesia's are for domestic consumption. The introduction of a poultry vaccination policy in Thailand would have threatened its potential to trade and had a major impact on its economy. Powerful domestic stakeholders in Vietnam and Indonesia, by contrast, were concerned less about international trade and more about maintaining a healthy domestic poultry population. Evidence on vaccination was drawn upon differently depending upon strategic economic positioning either to support or oppose the policy. With influenza A H5N1 endemic in some countries of the region, these policy differences raise questions around regional coherence of policies and the pursuit of an agreed overarching goal, be that eradication or mitigation. Moreover, whilst economic imperatives have been critically important in guiding policy formulation in the agriculture sector, questions arise regarding whether agriculture sectoral policy is coherent with public health sectoral policy across the region.","Pongcharoensuk P, Adisasmito W, Sat le M, Silkavute P, Muchlisoh L, Cong Hoat P, Coker R",Health Policy Plan,2012 Aug,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
18818732,Evolutionary dynamics and emergence of panzootic H5N1 influenza viruses.,"The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus lineage has undergone extensive genetic reassortment with viruses from different sources to produce numerous H5N1 genotypes, and also developed into multiple genetically distinct sublineages in China. From there, the virus has spread to over 60 countries. The ecological success of this virus in diverse species of both poultry and wild birds with frequent introduction to humans suggests that it is a likely source of the next human pandemic. Therefore, the evolutionary and ecological characteristics of its emergence from wild birds into poultry are of considerable interest. Here, we apply the latest analytical techniques to infer the early evolutionary dynamics of H5N1 virus in the population from which it emerged (wild birds and domestic poultry). By estimating the time of most recent common ancestors of each gene segment, we show that the H5N1 prototype virus was likely introduced from wild birds into poultry as a non-reassortant low pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus and was not generated by reassortment in poultry. In contrast, more recent H5N1 genotypes were generated locally in aquatic poultry after the prototype virus (A/goose/Guangdong/1/96) introduction occurred, i.e., they were not a result of additional emergence from wild birds. We show that the H5N1 virus was introduced into Indonesia and Vietnam 3-6 months prior to detection of the first outbreaks in those countries. Population dynamics analyses revealed a rapid increase in the genetic diversity of A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 lineage viruses from mid-1999 to early 2000. Our results suggest that the transmission of reassortant viruses through the mixed poultry population in farms and markets in China has selected HPAI H5N1 viruses that are well adapted to multiple hosts and reduced the interspecies transmission barrier of those viruses.","Vijaykrishna D, Bahl J, Riley S, Duan L, Zhang JX, Chen H, Peiris JS, Smith GJ, Guan Y",PLoS Pathog,2008 Sep 26,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
39778365,Purification immunoglobulin yolk anti avian influenza H5N1 in poultry using hydrophobic interaction chromatography.,"Avian influenza is a significant threat to the poultry industry, and it has become an outbreak in many countries because of its mortality and morbidity. Concerns about the history of avian influenza outbreaks has prompted all countries to enhance their independence in pharmaceutical and biological components as a preparedness measure for any potential occurrences. The production of antibodies such as IgY is a potential alternative. The potential of IgY biomaterials can be utilized as bioreceptors in diagnostic tools. This research aimed to purify IgY anti-avian influenza H5N1 produced from chicken eggs. IgY anti-avian influenza H5N1 can be obtained from chickens vaccinated at 0.5 ml per bird dose using inactivated H5N1 vaccine with a purification stage from graded PEG, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and concentrated using an ultrafilter. The present study shows that the IgY anti-avian influenza H5N1 can be obtained from chickens vaccinated with an inactivated H5N1 vaccine, from 4 chicken eggs with a total protein content of 40.01 mg, it has biological activity with HI titer activity of 4,915.2 HI units and a recovery value of 24 % with hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Therefore, the purification process with hydrophobic interaction chromatography does not remove the IgY biological antibody.

19686695,Comparative efficacy of North American and antigenically matched reverse genetics derived H5N9 DIVA marker vaccines against highly pathogenic Asian H5N1 avian influenza viruses in chickens.,"Highly pathogenic (HP) H5N1 avian influenza has become endemic in several countries in Asia and Africa, and vaccination is being widely used as a control tool. However, there is a need for efficacious vaccines preferably utilizing a DIVA (differentiate infected from vaccinated animals) marker strategy to allow for improved surveillance of influenza in vaccinated poultry. Using a reverse genetics approach, we generated Asian rgH5N9 vaccine strain deriving the hemagglutinin gene from A/chicken/Indonesia/7/2003 (H5N1) with modification of the cleavage site to be low pathogenic (LP) and N9 neuraminidase gene from the North American LP A/turkey/Wisconsin/1968 (H5N9) virus. The recombinant rgH5N9, A/turkey/Wisconsin/1968 (H5N9) A/chicken/Hidalgo/232/1994 (H5N2), and wild type HP A/chicken/Indonesia/7/2003 (H5N1) viruses were used to prepare inactivated oil-emulsified whole virus vaccines. Two weeks after vaccination, chickens were challenged with either Asian HP H5N1 viruses, A/chicken/Indonesia/7/2003 (W.H.O. clade 2.1) or A/chicken/Supranburi Thailand/2/2004 (W.H.O. clade 1.0). The H5 HA1 of the North American vaccine strains exhibited 12% amino acid differences including amino acid changes in the major antigenic sites as compared to the Asian HP H5N1 challenge viruses, serologically exhibited substantial antigenic difference, but still provided 100% protection from mortality. However, challenge virus shedding was significantly higher in chickens immunized with antigenically distinct American lineage vaccines as compared to the antigenically matched Asian rgH5N9 and the wild type Asian H5N1 vaccine. The antibody response to the heterologous subtype neuraminidase proteins were discriminated in vaccinated and infected chickens using a rapid fluorescent 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid sodium salt as substrate for neuraminidase inhibition assay. This study demonstrates the value of using a vaccine containing antigenically matched H5 hemagglutinin for control of HP H5N1 avian influenza in poultry and the potential utility of a heterologous neuraminidase as a DIVA marker.","Jadhao SJ, Lee CW, Sylte M, Suarez DL",Vaccine,2009 Oct 19,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
17112602,Susceptibility of highly pathogenic A(H5N1) avian influenza viruses to the neuraminidase inhibitors and adamantanes.,"Since 2003, highly pathogenic A(H5N1) influenza viruses have been the cause of large-scale death in poultry and the subsequent infection and death of over 140 humans. A group of 55 influenza A(H5N1) viruses isolated from various regions of South East Asia between 2004 and 2006 were tested for their susceptibility to the anti-influenza drugs the neuraminidase inhibitors and adamantanes. The majority of strains were found to be fully sensitive to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir carboxylate, zanamivir and peramivir; however two strains demonstrated increased IC50 values. Sequence analysis of these strains revealed mutations in the normally highly conserved residues 116 and 117 of the N1 neuraminidase. Sequence analysis of the M2 gene showed that all of the A(H5N1) viruses from Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia contained mutations (L26I and S31N) associated with resistance to the adamantane drugs (rimantadine and amantadine), while strains from Indonesia were found to be a mix of both adamantane resistant (S31N) and sensitive viruses. None of the A(H5N1) viruses from Myanmar contained mutations known to confer adamantane resistance. These results support the use of neuraminidase inhibitors as the most appropriate class of antiviral drug to prevent or treat human A(H5N1) virus infections.","Hurt AC, Selleck P, Komadina N, Shaw R, Brown L, Barr IG",Antiviral Res,2007 Mar,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia

However, little is known about the H5N1 influenza viruses that have been circulating there in recent years. We therefore conducted surveillance studies and isolated eight H5N1 viruses from chickens. Phylogenic analysis of their hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes revealed that all eight viruses belonged to clade 2.1.3. However, on the basis of nucleotide differences, these viruses could be divided into two groups. Other viruses genetically closely related to these two groups of viruses were all Indonesian isolates, suggesting that these new isolates have been evolving within Indonesia. Among these viruses, two distinct viruses circulated in the Kalimantan islands during the same season in 2010. Our data reveal the continued evolution of H5N1 viruses in Indonesia.","Nidom CA, Yamada S, Nidom RV, Rahmawati K, Alamudi MY, Kholik, Indrasari S, Hayati RS, Iwatsuki Horimoto K, Kawaoka Y",Virus Genes,2012 Jun,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
28624679,Neuraminidase-based recombinant virus-like particles protect against lethal avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection in ferrets.,"Avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses represent a growing threat for an influenza pandemic. The presence of widespread avian influenza virus infections further emphasizes the need for vaccine strategies for control of pre-pandemic H5N1 and other avian influenza subtypes. Influenza neuraminidase (NA) vaccines represent a potential strategy for improving vaccines against avian influenza H5N1 viruses. To evaluate a strategy for NA vaccination, we generated a recombinant influenza virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine comprised of the NA protein of A/Indonesia/05/2005 (H5N1) virus. Ferrets vaccinated with influenza N1 NA VLPs elicited high-titer serum NA-inhibition (NI) antibody titers and were protected from lethal challenge with A/Indonesia/05/2005 virus. Moreover, N1-immune ferrets shed less infectious virus than similarly challenged control animals. In contrast, ferrets administered control N2 NA VLPs were not protected against H5N1 virus challenge. These results provide support for continued development of NA-based vaccines against influenza H5N1 viruses.","Smith GE, Sun X, Bai Y, Liu YV, Massare MJ, Pearce MB, Belser JA, Maines TR, Creager HM, Glenn GM, Flyer D, Pushko P, Levine MZ, Tumpey TM",Virology,2017 Sep,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
27016757,Molecular analysis of hemagglutinin-1 fragment of avian influenza H5N1 viruses isolated from chicken farms in Indonesia from 2008 to 2010.,"Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of subtype H5N1 (AIV-H5N1) has been circulating in Indonesia since 2003. To understand the genetic diversity of these viruses, and to predict vaccine efficacy, the hemaglutinin-1 (HA-1) fragment of viruses isolated from chicken farms in Indonesia from 2008 to 2010 was sequenced and analyzed. The effects of these molecular changes were investigated in challenge experiments and HI assays of homologous and heterologous strains. Molecular analysis showed that these AIV-H5N1 isolates had evolved into three distinct sub-lineages from an ancestor circulating since 2003. Although no significant positive selection of residues was detected, 12 negatively selected sites were identified (p<0.05). Moreover, four sites showed evidence of significant episodic diversifying selection. The findings indicated complete protectivity and high HI titers with homologous strains, compared with protectivity ranging from 40 to 100% and lower HI titers with heterologous strains resulting from polymorphisms at antigenic sites. Our findings provide valuable insight into the molecular evolution of AIV and have important implications for vaccine efficacy and future vaccination strategies.","Mahardika GN, Jonas M, Murwijati T, Fitria N, Suartha IN, Suartini IG, Wibawan IW",Vet Microbiol,2016 Apr 15,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
20521726,Participatory disease surveillance and response in Indonesia: strengthening veterinary services and empowering communities to prevent and control highly pathogenic avian influenza.,"The participatory disease surveillance and response (PDSR) approach to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in Indonesia has evolved significantly from the participatory disease surveillance (PDS) system developed for rinderpest eradication in Africa and Pakistan. The first phase of the PDSR project emphasized the detection and control of HPAI by separate PDS and participatory disease response teams primarily in sector 4 poultry at the household level. Lessons learned during the first phase were taken into account in the design of the second phase of the project, which has sought to further strengthen management of disease prevention and control activities by improving technical approaches, increasing active participation of key stakeholders, including local and central governments, and focusing on the village level. The ongoing evolution of the PDSR program aims to establish a sustainable community-based program within provincial and district livestock services that enhances the prevention and control of not only HPAI, but also other zoonotic and priority animal diseases.","Azhar M, Lubis AS, Siregar ES, Alders RG, Brum E, McGrane J, Morgan I, Roeder P",Avian Dis,2010 Mar,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia

In 2004 an outbreak was reported in Malaysia. In 2005 H5N1 outbreaks were recorded in poultry in Russia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Romania, Turkey, and Ukraine, and virus was isolated from swans in Croatia. In 2004 HPAI H5N1 virus was isolated from smuggled eagles detected at the Brussels Airport and in 2005 imported caged birds held in quarantine in England. In 2006 HPAI was reported in poultry in Iraq, India, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Myanmar, Afghanistan, and Israel in Asia; Albania, France, and Sweden in Europe; and Nigeria, Cameroon, and Niger in Africa; as well as in wild birds in some 24 countries across Asia and Europe. In 2003, over 25,000,000 birds were slaughtered because of 241 outbreaks of HPAI caused by virus of H7N7 subtype in the Netherlands. The virus spread into Belgium (eight outbreaks) and Germany (one outbreak). HPAI H5N2 virus was responsible for outbreaks in ostriches in South Africa during 2005. HPAI H7N3 virus was isolated in Pakistan in 2004. Low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) H5 or H7 viruses were isolated from poultry in Italy (H7N3 2002-2003; H5N2 2005), The Netherlands (H7N3 2002), France (H5N2 2003), Denmark (H5N7 2003), Taiwan (H5N2 2004), and Japan (H5N2 2005).

25301756,Silent spread of highly pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 virus amongst vaccinated commercial layers.,"The aim of this study was to determine whether a single vaccination of commercial layer type chickens with an inactivated vaccine containing highly pathogenic avian influenza virus strain H5N1 A/chicken/Legok/2003, carried out on the farm, was sufficient to protect against infection with the homologous virus strain. A transmission experiment was carried out with pairs of chicken of which one was inoculated with H5N1 virus and the other contact-exposed. Results showed that the majority of the vaccinated birds developed haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titres below 4log2. No clinical signs were observed in the vaccinated birds and virus shedding was limited. However, nearly all vaccinated birds showed a four-fold or higher increase of HI titres after challenge or contact-exposure, which is an indication of infection. This implies that virus transmission most likely has occurred. This study showed that a single vaccination applied under field conditions induced clinical protection, but was insufficient to induce protection against virus transmission, suggesting that silent spread of virus in vaccinated commercial flocks may occur.","Poetri ON, Van Boven M, Claassen I, Koch G, Wibawan IW, Stegeman A, Van den Broek J, Bouma A",Res Vet Sci,2014 Dec,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
21896207,"A molecular and antigenic survey of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus isolates from smallholder duck farms in Central Java, Indonesia during 2007-2008.","BACKGROUND: Indonesia is one of the countries most severely affected by H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus in terms of poultry and human health. However, there is little information on the diversity of H5N1 viruses circulating in backyard farms, where chickens and ducks often intermingle. In this study, H5N1 virus infection occurring in 96 smallholder duck farms in central Java, Indonesia from 2007-2008 was investigated and the molecular and antigenic characteristics of H5N1 viruses isolated from these farms were analysed. RESULTS: All 84 characterised viruses belonged to H5N1 clade 2.1 with three virus sublineages being identified: clade 2.1.1 (1), clade 2.1.3 (80), and IDN/6/05-like viruses (3) that did not belong to any of the present clades. All three clades were found in ducks, while only clade 2.1.3 was isolated from chickens. There were no significant amino acid mutations of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) sites of the viruses, including the receptor binding, glycosylation, antigenic and catalytic sites and NA inhibitor targets. All the viruses had polybasic amino acids at the HA cleavage site. No evidence of major antigenic variants was detected. Based on the HA gene, identical virus variants could be found on different farms across the study sites and multiple genetic variants could be isolated from HPAI outbreaks simultaneously or at different time points from single farms. HPAI virus was isolated from both ducks and chickens; however, the proportion of surviving duck cases was considerably higher than in chickens. CONCLUSIONS: The 2.1.3 clade was the most common lineage found in this study. All the viruses had sequence characteristic of HPAI, but negligible variations in other recognized amino acids at the HA and NA proteins which determine virus phenotypes. Multiple genetic variants appeared to be circulating simultaneously within poultry communities. The high proportion of live duck cases compared to chickens over the study period suggests that ducks are more likely to survive infection and they may better suit the role of long-term maintenance host for H5N1. As some viruses were isolated from dead birds, there was no clear correlation between genetic variations and pathogenicity of these viruses.","Wibawa H, Henning J, Wong F, Selleck P, Junaidi A, Bingham J, Daniels P, Meers J",Virol J,2011 Sep 7,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia

16595307,Inactivated North American and European H5N2 avian influenza virus vaccines protect chickens from Asian H5N1 high pathogenicity avian influenza virus.,"High-pathogenicity (HP) avian influenza (AI) virus of the H5N1 subtype has caused an unprecedented epizootic in birds within nine Asian countries/regions since it was first reported in 1996. Vaccination has emerged as a tool for use in managing the infection in view of future eradication. This study was undertaken to determine whether two divergent H5N2 commercial vaccine strains, one based on a European and the other a North American low-pathogenicity AI virus, could protect chickens against a recent Asian H5N1 HPAI virus. The North American and European vaccine viruses had 84 and 91% deduced amino acid sequence similarity to the HA1 segment of haemagglutinin protein of Indonesia H5N1 HPAI challenge virus, respectively. Both vaccine strains provided complete protection from clinical signs and death. The vaccines reduced the number of chickens infected and shedding virus from the respiratory and intestinal tracts at the peak of virus replication. In addition, the quantity of virus shed was reduced by 10(4) to 10(5) median embryo infectious doses. The use of specific neuraminidase inhibition tests allowed identification of infected chickens within the vaccinated groups. These data indicate that the currently available H5 vaccines of European and North American lineages will protect chickens against the Asian H5N1 HPAI virus and reduce environmental contamination by the H5N1 HPAI virus. They will be an adjunct to biosecurity measures to reduce virus transmission.","Swayne DE, Lee CW, Spackman E",Avian Pathol,2006 Apr,Avian Influenza H5N1 AND Indonesia
39463113,Re-Emerging Trend of Mpox Infection: The Indonesia's Experience and Review.,"BACKGROUND: Since Monkeypox (mpox) had an outbreak on 6th May 2022 in 75 countries, it has been declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) that mpox is a public health of international emergency concern (PHEIC). WHO declared mpox as PHEIC again in August 204. Indonesia was also affected by the mpox outbreak with most of the cases coming from vulnerable populations. This study aimed to give an overview of mpox as well as the recent outbreak situation and management in Indonesia. METHODS: In this narrative review (using PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases combined with countries' national official reports and grey literatures), we discussed an overview of mpox including epidemiology, morphology, transmission, symptoms, treatment, and prevention. The management of mpox in Indonesia was specifically reviewed. RESULTS: Mpox is an infectious disease caused by the mpox virus which has infected 79,231 individuals globally. In Indonesia, the first mpox case was detected in August 2022 with 0 deaths and 88 confirmed cases as of August 2024. The virus is transmitted via respiratory droplets or direct contact with contaminated objects, surfaces, or mucocutaneous lesions of an infected individual which could lead to symptoms such as epidermal papules-pustules and clinical characteristics of classical smallpox. Although antivirals such as tecovirimat, cidofovir, and brincidofovir have been raised as potential treatments for mpox, these agents were only considered in severe cases in Indonesia. CONCLUSION: Mpox is a contagious disease that could cause major health problems if left uncontrolled, especially in specific vulnerable populations due to its high morbidity and mortality. Therefore, particular measures must be performed, especially in Indonesia.","Nelwan EJ, Tanadi C, Pajala FB, Stella MM, Tandarto K, Supranoto YTN, Kalaij AGI, Adiwinata R, Nainggolan L, Lie KC, Masyeni S, Sinto R",Acta Med Indones,2024 Jul,Mpox OR Monkeypox AND Indonesia
38561878,MPox Skin Lesions.,"Mpox is caused by the Monkeypox virus, which belongs to the Orthopoxvirus genus and Poxviridae family. The Monkeypox virus was first identified as a cause of disease in humans in the 1970s in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Mpox was considered endemic in several African countries. A global outbreak of Mpox was first recognized in Europe in May 2022 and was declared a public health emergency of international concern on July 23, 2022. The first reported Mpox case in Indonesia was in October 2022 which was identified as an imported case, there were no new confirmed Mpox cases until 13 October 2023. Since then there were 72 cases of confirmed Mpox cases in Indonesia by the end of 2023, distributed across 6 provinces, mostly in the Java island.We present two different spectrums of Mpox skin lesions in patients living with HIV, with a positive polymerase chain reaction test for Mpox. The first patient is a 48-year-old male, who developed a maculopapular lesion, that was initially noticed on the face, the lesions were then spread to the back and hand. He identifies as men who have sex with men and living with HIV for the past 18 years. There were no lesions on the genitalia or mucosa. The second patient is a 28-year-old male, the initial symptom was fever, followed by skin lesions after around 1 week of fever. The lesion initially appears as pustules on the face and then spreads throughout the whole body, the lesions also grow larger and become pseudo-pustules and ulcers. There were also mucosal involvements in the mouth, making oral intake difficult. This patient also identified as men who have sex with men with multiple partners, HIV status was not known at the initial presentation.

Caused by the monkeypox virus, this infection presents with symptoms similar to smallpox. Although two years have passed since the 2022 outbreak, new cases continue to emerge monthly. Initially, human cases of mpox were confined to outbreaks in central and western Africa. However, the virus has recently spread globally, possibly due to a decline in vaccination rates. In this context, evidence for effective therapies, such as antivirals, is urgently needed. Three antivirals-tecovirimat, brincidofovir, and cidofovir-are known to have activity against the mpox virus. Their use is currently limited to expanded access for treating non-variola orthopoxvirus infections, with ongoing phase 3 trials.

This study aimed to systematically identify and review research done on preclinical studies focusing on the potential monkeypox treatment and immunization. The presented juxtaposition of efficacy of potential treatments and vaccination that had been tested in preclinical trials could serve as a useful primer of monkeypox virus. The literature identified using key terms such as monkeypox virus or management or vaccine stringed using Boolean operators was systematically reviewed. Pubmed, SCOPUS, Cochrane, and preprint databases were used, and screening was performed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. A total of 467 results from registered databases and 116 from grey literature databases were screened. Of these results, 72 studies from registered databases and three grey literature studies underwent full-text screening for eligibility. In this systematic review, a total of 27 articles were eligible according to the inclusion criteria and were used. Tecovirimat, known as TPOXX or ST-246, is an antiviral drug indicated for smallpox infection whereas brincidofovir inhibits the viral DNA polymerase after incorporation into viral DNA. The ability of tecovirimat in providing protection to poxvirus-challenged animals from death had been demonstrated in a number of animal studies. Non-inferior with regard to immunogenicity was reported for the live smallpox/monkeypox vaccine compared with a single dose of a licensed live smallpox vaccine. The trial involving the live vaccine showed a geometric mean titre of vaccinia-neutralizing antibodies post two weeks of the second dose of the live smallpox/monkeypox vaccine. Of note, up to the third generation of smallpox vaccines-particularly JYNNEOS and Lc16m8-have been developed as preventive measures for MPXV infection and these vaccines had been demonstrated to have improved safety compared to the earlier generations.","Sudarmaji N, Kifli N, Hermansyah A, Yeoh SF, Goh BH, Ming LC",Viruses,2022 Nov 11,Mpox OR Monkeypox AND Indonesia

The independent Student's t-test, one-way ANOVA, and logistic regression were used to assess possible factors associated with knowledge, attitude, and worry toward mpox. A total of 510 respondents were included in the final analysis. The participants showed a moderate level of mpox knowledge, a neutral attitude towards mpox, and a relatively moderate worry level. The logistic regression analysis showed that age, gender, marital status, religion, level of education, and place of residence were associated with mpox knowledge; however, the significant variables in the multivariate regression analysis were gender, religion, level of education, and residential area. Gender and residential area were associated with attitudes toward mpox; however, the significant variables in the multivariate regression analysis were gender and residential areas. The worry toward mpox was influenced by gender, marital status, religion, and place of residence, yet the significant variables in the multivariate regression analysis were gender, religion, educational level, and residential area. In conclusion, the Kurdish population had moderate knowledge, a neutral attitude, and a moderate level of worry about mpox. Considering the continuous rapid rise in mpox cases in several countries, and its possible risk as pandemic amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, proactive control measures, adequate disease prevention strategies, and preparedness plans need to be formulated and immediately implemented to tackle the appearance of fears among people, and to safeguard the mental health of the public.","Ahmed SK, Abdulqadir SO, Omar RM, Abdullah AJ, Rahman HA, Hussein SH, Mohammed Amin HI, Chandran D, Sharma AK, Dhama K, Sallam M, Harapan H, Salari N, Chakraborty C, Abdulla AQ",Vaccines (Basel),2023 Mar 8,Mpox OR Monkeypox AND Indonesia
39463118,Challenges and Strategies for Controlling Indonesia's Emerging and Re-Emerging Infection Diseases (EID-REIDs).,"This review aims to highlight the occurrences of several emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, particularly 13 types under surveillance of Indonesia's emerging contagious disease task force. These diseases are considered potentially epidemic, due to the nature of tropical climate and high humidity of Indonesia's area. Several factors contribute to the emergence of these diseases: in conjunction with human behavior. Most of these diseases are zoonotic, specifically spread by viruses. The latest emerging infectious disease in Indonesia is monkeypox. Controlling the management of EID-REIDs presents a major obstacle for international health initiatives, particularly in Indonesia because of its extensive population, varied geographical landscape, and constrained resources. Overcoming these obstacles demands tactics like prioritizing Indonesian policies, bolstering disease monitoring systems, upgrading diagnostic capacities, fortifying public health facilities, fostering community involvement and education, and executing efficient prevention and management protocols. These strategies should be implemented in collaboration with international partners and organizations to effectively control and prevent the spread of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in Indonesia.","Triyono EA, Arini M, Asmarawati TP, Wirantara H, Tan F",Acta Med Indones,2024 Jul,Mpox OR Monkeypox AND Indonesia
38801583,Monkeypox Diagnosis in Clinical Settings: A Comprehensive Review of Best Laboratory Practices.,"An outbreak of monkeypox (Mpox) was reported in more than 40 countries in early 2022. Accurate diagnosis of Mpox can be challenging, but history, clinical findings, and laboratory diagnosis can establish the diagnosis. The pre-analytic phase of testing includes collecting, storing, and transporting specimens. It is advised to swab the lesion site with virus transport medium (VTM) containing Dacron or polyester flock swabs from two different sites. Blood, urine, and semen samples may also be used. Timely sampling is necessary to obtain a sufficient amount of virus or antibodies. The analytical phase of infectious disease control involves diagnostic tools to determine the presence of the virus. While polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the gold standard for detecting Mpox, genome sequencing is for identifying new or modified viruses. As a complement to these methods, isothermal amplification methods have been designed. ELISA assays are also available for the determination of antibodies. Electron microscopy is another effective diagnostic method for tissue identification of the virus. Wastewater fingerprinting provides some of the most effective diagnostic methods for virus identification at the community level. The advantages and disadvantages of these methods are further discussed. Post-analytic phase requires proper interpretation of test results and the preparation of accurate patient reports that include relevant medical history, clinical guidelines, and recommendations for follow-up testing or treatment.","Jain N, Umar TP, Sayad R, Mokresh ME, Tandarto K, Siburian R, Liana P, Laivacuma S, Reinis A",Adv Exp Med Biol,2024,Mpox OR Monkeypox AND Indonesia

Studies exploring the gastrointestinal symptoms and/or liver injury of Mpox are still very limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis is the first to summarize the gastrointestinal symptoms reported by Mpox patients. We searched for Mpox studies published until October 21, 2022, in MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and organization websites. Mpox studies were observational studies that reported at least one of either gastrointestinal symptoms and/or liver injury in Mpox patients. Meta-analysis was done to obtain the pooled prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms in Mpox patients. Subgroup analyses were done based on the study location, age groups, and Mpox Clades. The quality of included studies was assessed using the NIH Quality Assessment Tool. Overall, 31 studies that reported gastrointestinal symptoms and/or liver injury in Mpox patients were included. The reported gastrointestinal symptoms were abdominal pain, anorexia, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. There is a lack of reporting for liver injury. The most prevalent gastrointestinal symptoms in Mpox patients were anorexia (47%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 41%-53%), followed by vomiting (12%; 95% CI 11%-13%), nausea (10%; 95% CI 9%-11%), abdominal pain (9%; 95% CI 8%-10%), and diarrhea (5%; 95% CI 4%-6%). Additionally, the prevalence of proctitis, rectal/anal pain, and rectal bleeding were 11% (95% CI 11%-12%), 25% (95% CI 24%-27%), and 12% (95% CI 11%-13%), respectively. Anorexia was the most frequently reported gastrointestinal symptom in Mpox patients, followed by vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.

39927376,Navigating monkeypox: identifying risks and implementing solutions.,"Monkeypox is a zoonotic disease caused by the orthopox virus, a double-stranded DNA virus that belongs the Poxviridae virus family. It is known to infect both animals (especially monkeys and rodents) and humans and causes a rash similar to smallpox. Humans can become infected with monkeypox virus (MPXV) when they get in close contact with infected animals (zoonotic transmission) or other infected people (human-human transmission) through their body fluids such as mucus, saliva, or even skin sores. Frequently observed symptoms of this disease include fever, headaches, muscle aches, and a rash that initially looks like a tiny bump before becoming a lump that is filled with fluid. Monkeypox symptoms also include an incubation period of 5-21 days, divided into prodromal and eruption phases. Several contributing factors, such as smallpox vaccine discontinuation, widespread intake of infected animal products as a source of protein, and high population density, amongst others, have been linked to an increase in the frequency of monkeypox outbreaks. The best course of action for diagnosing individuals who may be suffering from active monkeypox is to collect a sample of skin from the lesion and perform PCR molecular testing. Monkeypox does not presently have a specific therapy; however, supportive care can assist in managing symptoms, such as medication to lower body temperature and pain. Three major orthopoxvirus vaccines have been approved to serve as a preventive measure against monkeypox: LC16, JYNNEOS, and ACAM2000. The discovery that the monkeypox outbreak is communicable both among humans and within a population has sparked new public health worries on the possibility of the outbreak of another viral pandemic. Research and studies are still being conducted to gain a deeper understanding of this zoonotic viral disease. This review is therefore focused on deciphering monkeypox, its etiology, pathogenesis, transmission, risk factors, and control.","Aryaloka S, Khairullah AR, Kusala MKJ, Fauziah I, Hidayatik N, Agil M, Yuliani MGA, Novianti AN, Moses IB, Purnama MTE, Wibowo S, Fauzia KA, Raissa R, Furqoni AH, Awwanah M, Riwu KHP",Open Vet J,2024 Dec,Mpox OR Monkeypox AND Indonesia
39749783,"Epidemiological and Clinical Characteristics of Mpox in Jakarta, Indonesia During October 2023 to February 2024.","OBJECTIVE: Mpox, a zoonotic disease, has emerged as a significant international public health concern due to an increase in the number of cases diagnosed in non-endemic countries. To support public health response efforts to interrupt Mpox transmission in the community, this study aims to identify epidemiological and clinical aspects of Mpox in Jakarta, Indonesia. METHODS: The study collected Mpox data from the Provincial Health Department in Jakarta, Indonesia, from October 2023 to February 2024. This included the symptom characteristics and demographics of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed and PCR-negative Mpox cases, which were then compared using the chi(2) test. RESULTS: Of the PCR-confirmed total of 58 Mpox cases, most were males (96.6%, 56/58). Of these, 67.2% (39/58) reported recent sexual activity within the 21 days prior to the disease onset date, with 41.4% (24/58) reporting only 1 sexual partner during that period. Among PCR-confirmed Mpox cases, common symptoms included fever (81.1%, 47/58), rash (63.8%, 37/58), and lesions (93.1%, 54/58). CONCLUSIONS: The predominance of male Mpox cases indicates transmission within men who have sex with men (MSM) networks, while higher prevalence among individuals with HIV or syphilis is due to shared behaviors, highlighting the need for surveillance, contact tracing, and targeted public health interventions.","Purnama TB, Wagatsuma K, Supriadi S, Salamah QN, Tang JW, Saito R",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,2025 Jan 3,Mpox OR Monkeypox AND Indonesia
39280280,Global prevalence and determinants associated with the acceptance of monkeypox vaccination.,"Assessing the acceptance of the monkeypox vaccine is crucial for the success of vaccination programs, yet the prevalence reports remain inconclusive. The aim of this study was to determine the global prevalence of monkeypox vaccine acceptance and identify its associated factors. A meta-analysis was conducted with a comprehensive search strategy on the following databases, including Scopus, Embase, and PubMed, for articles published up to April 5, 2024. This study utilizes a single-arm meta-analysis to calculate the pooled prevalence of monkeypox vaccine acceptance. A Z-test was employed to identify factors associated with the vaccine acceptance. Our study analyzed 51 articles encompassing 98,746 participants, revealing an overall monkeypox vaccine acceptance rate of 65%. Notably, the highest acceptance rates were observed among men who have sex with men (MSMs), while healthcare workers (HCWs) showed the lowest acceptance rates. Additionally, our findings indicated an increased acceptance in individuals with educational attainment beyond a bachelor's degree, a history of COVID-19 and influenza vaccination, homosexual orientation, and HIV-positive status. Conversely, lower acceptance risk was associated with those with educational attainment below a bachelor's degree, heterosexual orientation, and bisexual orientation. In conclusion, our current study has determined the rate of monkeypox vaccine acceptance and identified its associated factors. These findings offer valuable insights as the foundation for targeted policies to manage and increase acceptance rates.","Indiastari D, Fajar JK, Tamara F, Runesi O, Hakim LN, Chotimah K, Rahmani A, Saputro TD, Afrilla D, Firmansyah E, Dau D, Dzhyvak V",Narra J,2024 Aug,Mpox OR Monkeypox AND Indonesia
38801592,Overcoming Stigma: The Human Side of Monkeypox Virus.,"Monkeypox (Mpox) virus is a zoonotic disease that was recently declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO). Symptoms of Mpox include fever, headache, muscle pain, and a rash which starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. The stigma surrounding the Mpox virus has been one of the greatest challenges in dealing with the disease. People with Mpox have been often shunned by their communities, and many are afraid to seek medical care for fear of ostracism. For those affected by the virus, this stigma can significantly impact their mental health and quality of life. It is further fueled by misinformation and societal norms. Hence, a multifaceted approach that includes education, awareness campaigns, and community engagement is needed to overcome the stigma associated with Mpox. Effective communication strategies are critical to the dispelling of rumors and the reduction of fear. Interventional measures need to be shaped according to the needs of those affected.","Umar TP, Jain N, Sayad R, Tandarto K, Jain S, Reinis A",Adv Exp Med Biol,2024,Mpox OR Monkeypox AND Indonesia
36737358,Diabetes mellitus: Lessons from COVID-19 for monkeypox infection.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is known to be linked to malfunctioning antiviral defense; however, its association with the severity of monkeypox is poorly understood. In this review, we discuss key immunological mechanisms in the antiviral response affected by poor glucose control that could impact the susceptibility and severity of monkeypox infection, leading to a heightened emphasis on the use of the available antidiabetic drugs. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Google scholar for articles published from January 1985 to August 2022. No criteria for publication data were set, and all articles in English were included. RESULTS: Currently, there are no studies about the risk or consequences of monkeypox infection in the diabetic population. A high incidence of diabetes is reported in countries such as China, India, Pakistan, EUA, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico, Bangladesh, Japan, and Egypt, where unfortunately imported cases of monkeypox have been reported and the infection continues to spread. CONCLUSIONS: High incidence of diabetes together with the cessation of smallpox vaccination has left large numbers of the human population unprotected against monkeypox. The best option for the population remains confined to the prevention of infection as well as the use of hypoglycemic agents that have also been shown to improve immune mechanisms associated with viral protection.","Ruiz-Pacheco JA, Castillo-Diaz LA, Arreola-Torres R, Fonseca-Coronado S, Gomez-Navarro B",Prim Care Diabetes,2023 Apr,Mpox OR Monkeypox AND Indonesia
36372558,Monkeypox outbreak 2022: What we know so far and its potential drug targets and management strategies.,"Monkeypox is a rare zoonotic disease caused by infection with the monkeypox virus. The disease can result in flu-like symptoms, fever, and a persistent rash. The disease is currently spreading throughout the world and prevention and treatment efforts are being intensified. Although there is no treatment that has been specifically approved for monkeypox virus infection, infected patients may benefit from using certain antiviral medications that are typically prescribed for the treatment of smallpox. The drugs are tecovirimat, brincidofovir, and cidofovir, all of which are currently in short supply due to the spread of the monkeypox virus. Resistance is also a concern, as widespread replication of the monkeypox virus can lead to mutations that produce monkeypox viruses that are resistant to the currently available treatments. This article discusses monkeypox disease, potential drug targets, and management strategies to overcome monkeypox disease. With the discovery of new drugs, it is hoped that the problem of insufficient drugs will be resolved, and it is not anticipated that drug resistance will become a major issue in the near future.","Rabaan AA, Abas AH, Tallei TE, Al-Zaher MA, Al-Sheef NM, Fatimawali, Al-Nass EZ, Al-Ebrahim EA, Effendi Y, Idroes R, Alhabib MF, Al-Fheid HA, Adam AA, Bin Emran T",J Med Virol,2023 Jan,Mpox OR Monkeypox AND Indonesia

METHODS: This study used a retrospective study design to describe the epidemiological data, clinical features, and mortality of mpox patients from August 2022 to December 2023. In addition, this study also aims to identify the differences in both the epidemiology and clinical features of mpox in people living with HIV (PLHIV) and in non-HIV patients (non-PLHIV). RESULTS: Our study shows that, as of the end of December 2023, 59 mpox cases were treated in Jakarta. All of the mpox cases in Jakarta were diagnosed in males, mainly found in MSM (91.5%), and PLHIV (78%). Most patients would manifest with fever, rash, and skin lesions. Syphilis was found as a concomitant infection in this group (22/59, 37.2%). Severe manifestations were found among PLHIV without antiretroviral therapy (ART). CONCLUSIONS: Mpox cases in Jakarta were all found in males and most of them were PLHIV. There are various manifestations of mpox; however, since immunosuppressed patients could present differently, a strong surveillance and vaccine notification system, cautious management, and spreading vaccination awareness are needed to prevent and treat mpox.","Nilasari H, Miranda E, Marissa M, Ruspitawati A, Handayani DOTL, Salama N, Setiawan B, Supriadi, Aisyah TV, Inggariwati, Haq AS, Zuhroh S, Safitri EY, Pramono RA, Wisnuwardani I, Nelwan EJ, Sinto R, Susilo A, Saharman YR, Ratnoglik SL, Pitawati NLP, Fauzan M, Hasanah SSA, Sharasti M, Yunihastuti E",Vaccines (Basel),2025 Feb 20,Mpox OR Monkeypox AND Indonesia
37992435,Integrated bioinformatics approaches to investigate alterations in transcriptomic profiles of monkeypox infected human cell line model.,"BACKGROUND: The recent re-emergence of the monkeypox (mpox) epidemic in nonendemic regions has raised concerns regarding a potential global outbreak. The mpox virus (MPV) is a smallpox-like virus belonging to the genus Orthopoxvirus (family: Poxviridae). Although studies suggest that MPV infection suppresses the Toll-like receptor-3- and tumor necrosis factor-alpha-related signaling pathways, whether MPV regulates other immune-related pathways remains unclear. METHODS: In this study, two distinct temporal patterns were used for establishing an MPV-infected human immortal epithelial cancer cell line (HeLa). These two durations 2 and 12 h of incubation were selected to identify the coregulated genes and pathways affected by MPV infection. RESULTS: The use of the Gene Ontology framework, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome database, and MetaCore software yielded valuable insights. Specifically, various pathways were found to be enriched in HeLa cells infected with MPV for 2 and 12 h. These pathways included Notch, CD40, CD95, hypoxia-inducible factor-1-alpha, interleukin (IL)- 1, IL-6, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, nuclear factor-kappaB, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and oxidative stress-induced signalling pathways. Clusters and pathways of metabolism and viral replication cycles were significantly associated with the 2-hour infection group. This association was identified based on the regulation of genes such as HSPG2, RHPN2, MYL1, ASPHD2, CA9, VIPR1, SNX12, MGC2752, SLC25A1, PEX19, and AREG. Furthermore, clusters and pathways related to immunity and cell movement were found to be associated with the 12-hour infection group. This association was identified based on the regulation of genes such as C1orf21, C19orf48, HRK, IL8, GULP1, SCAND2, ATP5C1, FEZ1, SGSH, TACC2, CYP4X1, MMP1, CPB1, P2RY13, WDR27, PRPF4, and ENDOD1. CONCLUSIONS: This study can improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology and post-infection sequelae of mpox. Our findings provide valuable insights into the various modes of MPV infection.","Anuraga G, Lang J, Xuan DTM, Ta HDK, Jiang JZ, Sun Z, Dey S, Kumar S, Singh A, Kajla G, Wang WJ, Wang CY",J Infect Public Health,2024 Jan,Mpox OR Monkeypox AND Indonesia
39494157,Mapping the Mpox discourse: A network and sentiment analysis.,"Mpox, a zoonotic disease re-emerging from animals to humans, poses a risk of evolving into a global pandemic due to its high infectivity and potential asymptomatic transmission. This study maps the structure and configuration of mpox-related discussions on Twitter/X, identifies key influencers and top hashtags, and analyzes public sentiment. Data were collected using NodeXL Pro from May 7, 2022, to January 15, 2023, with the keyword ""Monkeypox"" and visualized using Gephi. Social network analysis ranked nodes by betweenness centrality scores to highlight key communicators, and the YifanHu layout algorithm visualized the network. Influential users, source topics, and hashtags were identified, and sentiment analysis was conducted using Azure Machine Learning tools. The analysis identified 11,397 mpox-related tweets. The network structure resembled a community with diverse participants. Influential users included health and science journalists, writers, academics, medical doctors, and public figures. News media and organizational websites were the top information sources, emphasizing the need for accessible scientific information. ""Monkeypox"" and ""Mpox"" were the most prevalent hashtags. Negative sentiments dominated the discussion. This analysis provides insights into network structure, key influencers, information sources, and public sentiment, aiding tailored health initiatives to address misinformation and advocate valid health information and emergency responses.","Kusuma IY, Visnyovszki A, Bahar MA",Explor Res Clin Soc Pharm,2024 Dec,Mpox OR Monkeypox AND Indonesia
36093436,Comparison of Transcriptomic Signatures between Monkeypox-Infected Monkey and Human Cell Lines.,"Monkeypox virus (MPV) is a smallpox-like virus belonging to the genus Orthopoxvirus of the family Poxviridae. Unlike smallpox with no animal reservoir identified and patients suffering from milder symptoms with less mortality, several animals were confirmed to serve as natural hosts of MPV. The reemergence of a recently reported monkeypox epidemic outbreak in nonendemic countries has raised concerns about a global outburst. Since the underlying mechanism of animal-to-human transmission remains largely unknown, comprehensive analyses to discover principal differences in gene signatures during disease progression have become ever more critical. In this study, two MPV-infected in vitro models, including human immortal epithelial cancer (HeLa) cells and rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) kidney epithelial (MK2) cells, were chosen as the two subjects to identify alterations in gene expression profiles, together with co-regulated genes and pathways that are affected during monkeypox disease progression. Using Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and MetaCore analyses, we discovered that elevated expression of genes associated with interleukins (ILs), G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), heat shock proteins (HSPs), Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and metabolic-related pathways play major roles in disease progression of both monkeypox-infected monkey MK2 and human HeLa cell lines. Interestingly, our analytical results also revealed that a cluster of differentiation 40 (CD40), plasmin, and histamine served as major regulators in the monkeypox-infected monkey MK2 cell line model, while interferons (IFNs), macrophages, and neutrophil-related signaling pathways dominated the monkeypox-infected human HeLa cell line model. Among immune pathways of interest, apart from traditional monkeypox-regulated signaling pathways such as nuclear factor- (NF-kappaB), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and tumor necrosis factors (TNFs), we also identified highly significantly expressed genes in both monkey and human models that played pivotal roles during the progression of monkeypox infection, including CXCL1, TNFAIP3, BIRC3, IL6, CCL2, ZC3H12A, IL11, CSF2, LIF, PTX3, IER3, EGR1, ADORA2A, and DUOX1, together with several epigenetic regulators, such as histone cluster family gene members, HIST1H3D, HIST1H2BJ, etc. These findings might contribute to specific underlying mechanisms related to the pathophysiology and provide suggestions regarding modes of transmission, post-infectious sequelae, and vaccine development for monkeypox in the future.","Xuan DTM, Yeh IJ, Wu CC, Su CY, Liu HL, Chiao CC, Ku SC, Jiang JZ, Sun Z, Ta HDK, Anuraga G, Wang CY, Yen MC",J Immunol Res,2022,Mpox OR Monkeypox AND Indonesia
32861468,Acceptance and willingness to pay for a hypothetical vaccine against monkeypox viral infection among frontline physicians: A cross-sectional study in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: A clinical trial is ongoing to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a monkeypox vaccine among healthcare workers (HCWs). The critical question that needs to be addressed is whether HCWs are willing to accept and purchase this vaccine. The objective of this study was to evaluate the acceptance and willingness to pay (WTP) for the vaccine among HCWs. METHODS: From May to July 2019, a cross-sectional study was conducted among registered general practitioners (GPs) in Indonesia. A contingent valuation method was employed to evaluate the WTP. Besides acceptance and WTP, various explanatory variables were also collected and assessed. A logistic regression and a multivariable linear regression were used to explore the explanatory variables influencing acceptance and WTP, respectively. RESULTS: Among 407 respondents, 391 (96.0%) expressed acceptance of a free vaccination. The mean and median WTP was US$ 37.0(95%CI:US$ 32.76-US$ 41.23) and US$ 17.90(95%CI:US$ 17.90-US$ 17.90), respectively. In an unadjusted analysis, those 30 years old or younger had 2.94 times greater odds of vaccine acceptance compared to those who were older (95%CI: 1.07-8.08). Location of alma mater, type of workplace, length of individual medical experience, and monthly income of GPs were all significantly associated with WTP. CONCLUSION: Although the vast majority of GPs would accept a freely provided vaccine, they were also somewhat price sensitive. This finding indicates that partial subsidy maybe required to achieve high vaccine coverage, particularly among GPs at community health centres or those with a shorter duration of medical practice.","Harapan H, Wagner AL, Yufika A, Setiawan AM, Anwar S, Wahyuni S, Asrizal FW, Sufri MR, Putra RP, Wijayanti NP, Salwiyadi S, Maulana R, Khusna A, Nusrina I, Shidiq M, Fitriani D, Muharrir M, Husna CA, Yusri F, Maulana R, Rajamoorthy Y, Groneberg DA, Muller R, Mudatsir M",Vaccine,2020 Oct 7,Mpox OR Monkeypox AND Indonesia
37736424,The Biosafety Research Road Map: The Search for Evidence to Support Practices in the Laboratory-Mpox/Monkeypox Virus.,"INTRODUCTION: The virus formerly known as monkeypox virus, now called mpoxv, belongs to the Orthopoxvirus genus and can cause mpox disease through both animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission. The unexpected spread of mpoxv among humans has prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). METHODS: We conducted a literature search to identify the gaps in biosafety, focusing on five main areas: how the infection enters the body and spreads, how much of the virus is needed to cause infection, infections acquired in the lab, accidental release of the virus, and strategies for disinfecting and decontaminating the area. DISCUSSION: The recent PHEIC has shown that there are gaps in our knowledge of biosafety when it comes to mpoxv. We need to better understand where this virus might be found, how much of it can spread from person-to-person, what are the effective control measures, and how to safely clean up contaminated areas. By gathering more biosafety evidence, we can make better decisions to protect people from this zoonotic agent, which has recently become more common in the human population.","Blacksell SD, Dhawan S, Kusumoto M, Khanh Le K, Summermatter K, O'Keefe J, Kozlovac J, Al Muhairi SS, Sendow I, Scheel CM, Ahumibe A, Masuku ZM, Bennett AM, Kojima K, Harper DR, Hamilton K",Appl Biosaf,2023 Sep 1,Mpox OR Monkeypox AND Indonesia

Also, to identify key challenges to prevent and improve the health of the affected community. METHODS: Between January 26, 2023 and November 30, 2023, the DRC reported its highest incidence of mpox cases,with a total of 12,569 suspected cases in 156 health zones from 22 of the 26 country's provinces. The Katako-Kombe Health Zone registered 369 suspected cases and 17 deaths, making it one of the hotspots of the outbreak. RESULTS: Ten villages and centres were affected, with an attack rate (AT) of 2.15 per thousand and a case fatality rate (CFR) of 4.6%. Epi-curves showed an increase in clinical cases from January to May 2023, followed by a decrease until August 2023 and a resurgence of cases in September 2023, with a reproduction rate of 1.29. Furthermore, the occurrence of complications appeared to increase the CFR with 7 (14%), 11 (18.03%), and 9 (23.68%) for encephalitis, anemia, and pulmonary complications, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: AT, CFR, and transmission rate appeared to be lower in the current epidemic than in previous outbreaks and in Clade I. Critically, delayed medical care increases the incidence of complications and CFR. Therefore, mpox requires early diagnosis and prompt public health response. Including the possibility of mpox in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with a vesicular or pustular rash is suggested.","Mbelambela EPS, Wandja AJP, Villanueva AF, Olamba ND, Omba L, Muchanga SMJ",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,2025 Mar,Mpox OR Monkeypox AND Indonesia
32202967,Knowledge of human monkeypox viral infection among general practitioners: a cross-sectional study in Indonesia.,"After the first, imported, laboratory-confirmed case of monkeypox in human was reported in Singapore on May 2019, countries in Asia started to strengthen disease surveillance systems. One challenge in preventing monkeypox is a lack of knowledge, particularly among healthcare workers. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge of monkeypox among general practitioners (GPs) in Indonesia. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted. The survey collected participants' knowledge on a 21-item scale and explanatory variables. A two-step logistic regression analysis was employed to assess the predictors of knowledge of monkeypox. A total of 432 GPs were included; 10.0% and 36.5% of them had a good knowledge using an 80% and 70% cutoff point for knowledge domain, respectively. No explanatory variables were associated with knowledge when using 80% cutoff point. Using the lower cutoff, there was lower knowledge among GPs who graduated from universities located in Sumatra or other islands versus Java (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 0.53; 95%CI: 0.28-0.97, p = 0.041) and among those were older than 30 years compared to younger GPs (aOR: 0.61; 95%CI: 0.39-0.96, p = 0.033). GPs working in private clinics had less knowledge compared to GPs in community health centers (aOR: 0.55; 95%CI: 0.31-0.99, p = 0.047). In conclusion, knowledge of monkeypox among GPs in Indonesia is relatively low in all groups. Increasing knowledge of monkeypox will be key to improving the capacity of GPs to respond to human monkeypox cases and to report into a disease surveillance system.","Harapan H, Setiawan AM, Yufika A, Anwar S, Wahyuni S, Asrizal FW, Sufri MR, Putra RP, Wijayanti NP, Salwiyadi S, Maulana R, Khusna A, Nusrina I, Shidiq M, Fitriani D, Muharrir M, Husna CA, Yusri F, Maulana R, Andalas M, Wagner AL, Mudatsir M",Pathog Glob Health,2020 Mar,Mpox OR Monkeypox AND Indonesia
39944657,Systematic review: characteristics of myocarditis followed by fixed drug eruption and dry eye syndrome in patients who have been vaccinated with monkeypox in children and adults.,"BACKGROUND: The Monkeypox Virus (MPOX) has caused a surge in viral infections, leading to the WHO recognizing it as a public health emergency of international concern. MPOX infection shares clinical similarities with smallpox but can cause complications like myocarditis, anorectal pain, ocular lesions, kidney damage, or soft tissue superinfection. The study aims to understand the characteristics of myocarditis, fixed drug eruption, and dry eye syndrome in Monkeypox patients. METHODS: This review was conducted based on PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses), and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The data was obtained from Scopus and international journal databases by conducting combined keyword searches restricted to English-language publications. RESULT: The study examined 25 cases of Monkeypox, primarily involving males aged 32.9 years and experiencing chest pain. The prognosis was generally good, with no reported death. Risk factors for infection include sexual activity, STD diagnosis, sexual encounters, and workplace exposure to orthopoxviruses. Most cases were male and involved chest pain. Myocarditis, an inflammation in the myocardium, can cause dilated cardiomyopathy, acute arrhythmia, and heart failure. The pathophysiology of myocarditis in Monkeypox patients is not yet determined due to rarity of cases. CONCLUSION: MPOX infection presents unique complications like myocarditis, necessitating research for vaccines, antiviral drugs, and infection prevention measures. Early screening for chest pain and investigating MPXV infection's pathogenesis and clinical features are crucial for differential diagnosis during outbreaks. This systematic review can determine MPOX infection outcomes and prepare appropriate treatment for patients with complications.","Mohamad Javier R, Prijanto SA, Yora VS, Yuliana Eka Pratiwi DG, Lilhawa Ditsi ES, Adelia B, Tansuri VC, Wijaya H, Caecarma GY, Damayanti IT, Ramadhanti A, Rahmaputri A, Albab CF, Ferdian A, Farabi F, Ayu FR, Ika Regina Maharani NP, Arifin AP, Herwanto ES, A SR, Arviana SD, Lathifah SN, Yulinar NR, Safitri LS, Adnani B, Fazrian Danu MR, Naomi N, Deria DD, Syifa A, Andana P, Prasetya A, Agfata FR, Margaretha MC, Indrasto SB, Sukirman, Rachmanto, Nufus H, Chandrawati PF, Prasetyo AD, Sutanto L, Sander MA",Front Cardiovasc Med,2024,Mpox OR Monkeypox AND Indonesia
39707867,Effectiveness of Tecovirimat in Mpox Cases: A Systematic Review of Current Evidence.,"Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, has re-emerged as a significant global health concern, particularly during the widespread outbreak of 2022. As an orthopoxvirus related to the eradicated smallpox virus, mpox has been primarily managed with smallpox vaccines and treatments, including the antiviral agent Tecovirimat. This systematic review aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Tecovirimat in treating mpox, focusing on its use during the 2022 outbreak, especially among high-risk populations, including men who have sex with men and people living with HIV. We conducted a comprehensive search across databases, such as Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science, up to August 30, 2024. The selection involved a two-stage review process utilizing the Nested Knowledge platform, which helped streamline the screening and data extraction. We included studies that focused on the clinical efficacy and safety of Tecovirimat in human patients with confirmed mpox infections. Our analysis mainly synthesized data narratively due to the heterogeneity of study designs and outcomes. Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria, providing data on 1031 mpox cases. The preliminary analysis of the PALM 007 RCT indicated that tecovirimat did not significantly outperform placebo in lesion resolution for all patients. Lesions healed faster than expected, regardless of tecovirimat or placebo treatment. A lower mortality rate of 1.7% among those enrolled in the PALM 007 RCT was observed, compared to the general mpox mortality rate of 3.6% or higher in the DRC. Observational studies revealed that early administration of Tecovirimat, especially within the first week of symptom onset, significantly improves symptom resolution, reduces the severity of the disease, and decreases the likelihood of hospitalization and complications in observational studies. However, the impact on viral clearance was inconsistent, and some studies suggested limited efficacy in severely immunocompromised patients. Regarding safety, Tecovirimat was generally well-tolerated as indicated by the RCT; however, mild adverse effects such as fatigue, headache, and nausea were commonly reported among observational studies. Serious adverse events were rare but included elevated liver enzymes and psychiatric symptoms, particularly in patients with pre-existing conditions. Tecovirimat demonstrates some potential benefits in treating mpox, particularly when administered early. The PALM 007 RCT failed to meet the efficacy point. Tecovirimat is generally well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile, although monitoring is advisable for those with existing liver or renal conditions. Despite promising results, further large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to fully ascertain the drug's effectiveness across diverse populations and to explore its impact on viral clearance and transmission dynamics.","Shabil M, Khatib MN, Ballal S, Bansal P, Tomar BS, Ashraf A, Kumar MR, Sinha A, Rawat P, Gaidhane AM, Bushi G, Singh MP, Bhopte K, Pant M, Chilakam N, Pandey S, Brar M, Balaraman AK, Mehta R, Shaikh ZA, Harapan H, Sah R",J Med Virol,2024 Dec,Mpox OR Monkeypox AND Indonesia
35888642,Knowledge of Human Monkeypox and Its Relation to Conspiracy Beliefs among Students in Jordanian Health Schools: Filling the Knowledge Gap on Emerging Zoonotic Viruses.,"Background and Objective: The recent multi-country outbreak of human monkeypox (HMPX) in non-endemic regions poses an emerging public health concern. University students in health schools/faculties represent a core knowledgeable group that can be helpful to study from a public health point of view. As future healthcare workers, assessment of their knowledge and attitude towards emerging zoonotic viral infections can be helpful to assess their taught material and courses with potential improvement if gaps in knowledge were identified. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the level of HMPX knowledge, conspiracy beliefs regarding emerging virus infections, as well as their associated determinants among university students studying Medicine, Nursing, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Medical Laboratory Sciences, and Rehabilitation in Jordanian health schools/faculties. In addition, we sought to evaluate the correlation between HMPX knowledge and the extent of holding conspiracy beliefs regarding emerging viral infection. Materials and Methods: A convenient sample of university students was obtained through an electronic survey distributed in late May 2022 using the chain-referral approach. Assessment of HMPX knowledge and general attitude towards emerging virus infections was based on survey items adopted from previously published literature. Results: The study sample comprised 615 students with a mean age of 20 years and a majority of females (432, 70.2%) and medical students (n = 351, 57.1%). Out of eleven monkeypox knowledge items, three were identified correctly by >70% of the respondents. Only 26.2% of the respondents (n = 161) knew that vaccination to prevent monkeypox is available. Age was significantly associated with better HMPX knowledge for a majority of items. Older age, females, and affiliation to non-medical schools/faculties were associated with harboring higher levels of conspiracy beliefs regarding emerging virus infections. Our data also indicate that lower levels of HMPX knowledge were associated with higher levels of conspiracy beliefs. Conclusion: The current study pointed to generally unsatisfactory levels of knowledge regarding the emerging HMPX among university students in Jordanian health schools/faculties. Conspiracy beliefs regarding emerging virus infections were widely prevalent, and its potential detrimental impact on health behavior should be evaluated in future studies.","Sallam M, Al-Mahzoum K, Dardas LA, Al-Tammemi AB, Al-Majali L, Al-Naimat H, Jardaneh L, AlHadidi F, Al-Salahat K, Al-Ajlouni E, AlHadidi NM, Bakri FG, Mahafzah A, Harapan H",Medicina (Kaunas),2022 Jul 11,Mpox OR Monkeypox AND Indonesia
36141334,Assessing Healthcare Workers' Knowledge and Their Confidence in the Diagnosis and Management of Human Monkeypox: A Cross-Sectional Study in a Middle Eastern Country.,"The ongoing multi-country human monkeypox (HMPX) outbreak was declared as a public health emergency of international concern. Considering the key role of healthcare workers (HCWs) in mitigating the HMPX outbreak, we aimed to assess their level of knowledge and their confidence in diagnosis and management of the disease, besides the assessment of their attitude towards emerging virus infections from a conspiracy point of view. An online survey was distributed among HCWs in Jordan, a Middle Eastern country, during May-July 2022 using a questionnaire published in a previous study among university students in health schools in Jordan. The study sample comprised 606 HCWs, with about two-thirds being either physicians (n = 204, 33.7%) or nurses (n = 190, 31.4%). Four out of the 11 HMPX knowledge items had <50% correct responses with only 33.3% of the study respondents having previous knowledge that vaccination is available to prevent HMPX. A majority of study respondents (n = 356, 58.7%) strongly agreed, agreed or somewhat agreed that the spread of HMPX is related to a role of male homosexuals. Confidence in the ability of diagnosis based on the available monkeypox virus diagnostic tests was reported by 50.2% of the respondents, while the confidence levels were lower for the ability to manage (38.9%) and to diagnose (38.0%) HMPX cases based on their current level of knowledge and skills. Higher confidence levels for HMPX diagnosis and management were found among physicians compared to nurses. The endorsement of conspiracy beliefs about virus emergence was associated with lower HMPX knowledge, the belief in the role of male homosexuals in HMPX spread, and with lower diagnosis and management confidence levels. The current study highlighted the gaps in knowledge regarding HMPX among HCWs in Jordan as well as the lack of confidence to diagnose and manage cases among physicians and nurses. Raising the awareness about the disease is needed urgently considering the rapid escalation in the number of cases worldwide with reported cases in the Middle East. The attitude towards male homosexuals' role in HMPX spread necessitates proper intervention measures to prevent stigma and discrimination among this risk group. The adoption of conspiratorial beliefs regarding virus emergence was widely prevalent and this issue needs to be addressed with proper and accurate knowledge considering its potential harmful impact.","Sallam M, Al-Mahzoum K, Al-Tammemi AB, Alkurtas M, Mirzaei F, Kareem N, Al-Naimat H, Jardaneh L, Al-Majali L, AlHadidi A, Al-Salahat K, Al-Ajlouni E, AlHadidi NM, Bakri FG, Harapan H, Mahafzah A",Healthcare (Basel),2022 Sep 8,Mpox OR Monkeypox AND Indonesia
40183658,Unveiling the Outcomes of Mpox in Pregnancy: A Systematic Review and Single-Arm Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The global resurgence of mpox, formerly monkeypox, poses an emerging threat to pregnant women due to immunological changes and potential vertical transmission, yet its impact on pregnancy remains underexplored. This study aims to pioneer a comprehensive assessment of pregnancy outcomes and the risks of vertical transmission associated with mpox infection during pregnancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we searched three databases up to September 2024 for studies on pregnant women with mpox confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Primary outcomes were composite adverse pregnancy outcomes: miscarriage or fetal death, congenital anomalies, and chorioamnionitis; the secondary outcome was vertical transmission. Study quality was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute tools. Statistical analysis employed R software using a one-proportion model with Freeman-Tukey transformation and random-effects meta-analysis (restricted maximum-likelihood estimator, Knapp-Hartung adjustment), presenting estimated proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Six studies (three case series, three case reports) comprising 11 singleton pregnancies were included. Diagnoses occurred in the first (27.3%), second (45.4%), and third trimesters (27.3%). Among the five genotypically identified Mpox cases, 20.0% were classified Clade I and 80.0% as Clade II. Meta-analysis indicated that an estimated 63% (95% CI, 43-83%) of pregnancies experienced composite adverse pregnancy outcomes. Specifically, miscarriage or fetal death occurred in 62% (95% CI, 21-102%), congenital anomalies in 50% (95% CI, 21-80%), and chorioamnionitis in 78% (95% CI, 44-96%). Vertical transmission was observed in 79% (95% CI, 6-151%). Despite small sample sizes leading to wide confidence intervals, high estimated proportions suggest that mpox severely impacts pregnancy outcomes, likely linked to maternal inflammation, placental invasion, and significant fetal risks from vertical transmission. CONCLUSION: Mpox infection during pregnancy appears to be associated with high rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes and vertical transmission. Further large-scale studies are warranted to confirm these findings and develop preventive and management strategies mitigating this emerging threat.","Winata IGS, Leonardo L, Sylfiasari R, Ekafentie A, Immanuel SS, Christyani F",Infect Chemother,2025 Mar,Mpox OR Monkeypox AND Indonesia
32194068,Confidence in managing human monkeypox cases in Asia: A cross-sectional survey among general practitioners in Indonesia.,"The current re-emergence of human monkeypox (HMPX) is a global concern for endemic and non-endemic countries, but healthcare workers in some regions, like Asia, have less experience with identifying and treating HMPX cases. This study aimed to assess the confidence and its predictors in HMPX case management among general practitioners (GPs), the frontline doctors in Indonesia, and to explore their perspectives on HMPX. Between May and July 2019, GPs in Indonesia completed an online-based survey. The questionnaire collected information on GPs' confidence, perspective, sociodemographic, workplace and professional characteristics, exposure to HMPX information and knowledge on HMPX. A logistic regression analysis was employed to explore the explanatory variables influencing the confidence and the perspective. We included 395 GPs in our analysis (77.4% out of 510 responses received) of which 10.1% and 34.9% were classified having good confidence using an 80% and 70% cut-off for confidence score, respectively. In the adjusted analysis, receiving information about HMPX during medical training was the only variable significantly associated with good confidence (adjusted odds ratio 2.74, 95% confidence interval 1.57 to 4.78 and p < 0.001). Approximately 73.6% and 77.9% of GPs agreed that HMPX is an important infectious disease and it has potential to detrimentally impact the Indonesian economy, respectively. In addition, 88.8% of GPs suggested that the disease should be incorporated into the National Medical Curriculum of Indonesia. In conclusion, in case of HMPX outbreak, majority of the GPs in Indonesia seem to be less confident in diagnosing and treating cases, using their current knowledge, skills and their workplace facilities. Therefore, a systematic strategy to improve their confidence in managing HMPX is required.","Harapan H, Setiawan AM, Yufika A, Anwar S, Wahyuni S, Asrizal FW, Sufri MR, Putra RP, Wijayanti NP, Salwiyadi S, Maulana R, Khusna A, Nusrina I, Shidiq M, Fitriani D, Muharrir M, Husna CA, Yusri F, Maulana R, Utomo PS, Andalas M, Wagner AL, Mudatsir M",Acta Trop,2020 Jun,Mpox OR Monkeypox AND Indonesia
36245638,Physicians' willingness to be vaccinated with a smallpox vaccine to prevent monkeypox viral infection: A cross-sectional study in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Although there is no licensed vaccine for monkeypox, smallpox vaccine has been shown to be 85% effective in preventing the monkeypox. This study was conducted to assess the willingness of frontline healthcare providers to be vaccinated with smallpox vaccine to prevent monkeypox. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Indonesia. The willingness was assessed under two scenarios: fully subsidized and non-subsidized vaccine. Explanatory variables such as sociodemographic profile, workplace and professional characteristics, and knowledge of monkeypox were collected. A logistic regression assessed the influence of these explanatory variables on participants' willingness. RESULTS: Out of 510 received participants' responses, 407 (79.8%) were analyzed. With a fully subsidized vaccine scenario, 381 (93.6%) of the participants were willing to be vaccinated and in an unadjusted analysis, gender, education, monthly income, and type of workplace were associated with willingness. With a non-subsidized vaccine (i.e. the vaccine price was US$ 17.9), the proportion who were willing to be vaccinated decreased to 71.9%. In adjusted analyses for both scenarios, gender was the only independent predictor for willingness; men were less willing to be vaccinated than women, adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 0.37; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.16, 0.87 and aOR: 0.42; 95%CI: 0.27, 0.67, respectively for subsidized and non-subsidized scenario. CONCLUSION: Vaccine price and gender are important factors for physicians' willingness to be vaccinated for smallpox vaccine prevent monkeypox in Indonesia. These findings indicate that achieving high vaccine converge may require partially or fully subsidized vaccines, along with a clear guideline and recommendation from authorities.","Harapan H, Setiawan AM, Yufika A, Anwar S, Wahyuni S, Asrizal FW, Sufri MR, Putra RP, Wijayanti NP, Salwiyadi S, Maulana R, Khusna A, Nusrina I, Shidiq M, Fitriani D, Muharrir M, Husna CA, Yusri F, Maulana R, Itoh N, Andalas M, Wagner AL, Mudatsir M",Clin Epidemiol Glob Health,2020 Dec,Mpox OR Monkeypox AND Indonesia

New information, such as atypical clinical manifestations and transmission via sexual activities, have been identified. These pose a potential risk of widespread outbreaks due to unusual clinical manifestations and failure to consider mpox as a diagnosis by physicians and the sexual behaviours of some tourists in Southeast Asia. Since Southeast Asia is a popular tourist destination, there is substantial potential for the silent spread of mpox in this region. Consequently, there is an urgent need for effective surveillance measures at points of entry of international travelers to identify suspected cases and their close contacts in order to limit the spread of mpox in Southeast Asia.","Matsee W, Charoensakulchai S, Wirawan IMA, Imad HA",Travel Med Infect Dis,2023 Jul-Aug,Mpox OR Monkeypox AND Indonesia

36548666,Conspiratorial Attitude of the General Public in Jordan towards Emerging Virus Infections: A Cross-Sectional Study Amid the 2022 Monkeypox Outbreak.,"Conspiracy theories accompany the emergence of infectious diseases and the 2022 multi-country monkeypox (MPX) outbreak is no exception. It is possible that the adoption of conspiracy beliefs negatively impacts health behavior. We aimed to assess the prevalence of conspiratorial attitudes towards emerging virus infections (EVIs) and the response measures aiming to control these infections among the general public in Jordan. In addition, we assessed MPX knowledge and the belief in the role of men who have sex with men (MSM) in virus spread. The online survey data were collected during 24 May 2022-28 June 2022. The survey instrument was based on previously published scales designed to measure MPX knowledge and EVI conspiracies. A total of 611 respondents formed the final study sample, with a mean age of 44 years and a majority of females (n = 433, 70.9%). On a scale ranging from -10 to +10, the median MPX knowledge score in the study sample was +3 (interquartile range: +1 to +5). Educational level was a determinant of MPX knowledge in multivariate analysis. More than 50% of the participants agreed at least to some extent with 9 out of 12 of the EVI conspiracy items. Multivariate analysis showed that embracing conspiracy beliefs about EVIs was associated with being female, and agreeing with or having no opinion regarding the role of MSM in MPX spread. The current study revealed the high prevalence of belief in conspiracies surrounding EVIs, and its accompanying intervention measures, among the general public in Jordan. In addition, a lower level of MPX knowledge was observed compared to previous studies among university students and health professionals in the country. We recommend evaluating the impact of the widely prevalent conspiracy beliefs on health aspects in future studies. This aim is particularly relevant in the Middle Eastern countries where embracing specific conspiracy ideas is a common occurrence.","Sallam M, Eid H, Awamleh N, Al-Tammemi AB, Barakat M, Athamneh RY, Hallit S, Harapan H, Mahafzah A",Trop Med Infect Dis,2022 Nov 30,Mpox OR Monkeypox AND Indonesia
37697804,"Global diversity and antimicrobial resistance of typhoid fever pathogens: Insights from a meta-analysis of 13,000 Salmonella Typhi genomes.","BACKGROUND: The Global Typhoid Genomics Consortium was established to bring together the typhoid research community to aggregate and analyse Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (Typhi) genomic data to inform public health action. This analysis, which marks 22 years since the publication of the first Typhi genome, represents the largest Typhi genome sequence collection to date (n=13,000). METHODS: This is a meta-analysis of global genotype and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants extracted from previously sequenced genome data and analysed using consistent methods implemented in open analysis platforms GenoTyphi and Pathogenwatch. RESULTS: Compared with previous global snapshots, the data highlight that genotype 4.3.1 (H58) has not spread beyond Asia and Eastern/Southern Africa; in other regions, distinct genotypes dominate and have independently evolved AMR. Data gaps remain in many parts of the world, and we show the potential of travel-associated sequences to provide informal 'sentinel' surveillance for such locations. The data indicate that ciprofloxacin non-susceptibility (>1 resistance determinant) is widespread across geographies and genotypes, with high-level ciprofloxacin resistance (>/=3 determinants) reaching 20% prevalence in South Asia. Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid has become dominant in Pakistan (70% in 2020) but has not yet become established elsewhere. Ceftriaxone resistance has emerged in eight non-XDR genotypes, including a ciprofloxacin-resistant lineage (4.3.1.2.1) in India. Azithromycin resistance mutations were detected at low prevalence in South Asia, including in two common ciprofloxacin-resistant genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: The consortium's aim is to encourage continued data sharing and collaboration to monitor the emergence and global spread of AMR Typhi, and to inform decision-making around the introduction of typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs) and other prevention and control strategies.

39299261,Global burden of bacterial antimicrobial resistance 1990-2021: a systematic analysis with forecasts to 2050.,"BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses an important global health challenge in the 21st century. A previous study has quantified the global and regional burden of AMR for 2019, followed with additional publications that provided more detailed estimates for several WHO regions by country. To date, there have been no studies that produce comprehensive estimates of AMR burden across locations that encompass historical trends and future forecasts. METHODS: We estimated all-age and age-specific deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to and associated with bacterial AMR for 22 pathogens, 84 pathogen-drug combinations, and 11 infectious syndromes in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. We collected and used multiple cause of death data, hospital discharge data, microbiology data, literature studies, single drug resistance profiles, pharmaceutical sales, antibiotic use surveys, mortality surveillance, linkage data, outpatient and inpatient insurance claims data, and previously published data, covering 520 million individual records or isolates and 19 513 study-location-years. We used statistical modelling to produce estimates of AMR burden for all locations, including those with no data. Our approach leverages the estimation of five broad component quantities: the number of deaths involving sepsis; the proportion of infectious deaths attributable to a given infectious syndrome; the proportion of infectious syndrome deaths attributable to a given pathogen; the percentage of a given pathogen resistant to an antibiotic of interest; and the excess risk of death or duration of an infection associated with this resistance. Using these components, we estimated disease burden attributable to and associated with AMR, which we define based on two counterfactuals; respectively, an alternative scenario in which all drug-resistant infections are replaced by drug-susceptible infections, and an alternative scenario in which all drug-resistant infections were replaced by no infection. Additionally, we produced global and regional forecasts of AMR burden until 2050 for three scenarios: a reference scenario that is a probabilistic forecast of the most likely future; a Gram-negative drug scenario that assumes future drug development that targets Gram-negative pathogens; and a better care scenario that assumes future improvements in health-care quality and access to appropriate antimicrobials. We present final estimates aggregated to the global, super-regional, and regional level. FINDINGS: In 2021, we estimated 4.71 million (95% UI 4.23-5.19) deaths were associated with bacterial AMR, including 1.14 million (1.00-1.28) deaths attributable to bacterial AMR. Trends in AMR mortality over the past 31 years varied substantially by age and location. From 1990 to 2021, deaths from AMR decreased by more than 50% among children younger than 5 years yet increased by over 80% for adults 70 years and older. AMR mortality decreased for children younger than 5 years in all super-regions, whereas AMR mortality in people 5 years and older increased in all super-regions. For both deaths associated with and deaths attributable to AMR, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus increased the most globally (from 261 000 associated deaths [95% UI 150 000-372 000] and 57 200 attributable deaths [34 100-80 300] in 1990, to 550 000 associated deaths [500 000-600 000] and 130 000 attributable deaths [113 000-146 000] in 2021). Among Gram-negative bacteria, resistance to carbapenems increased more than any other antibiotic class, rising from 619 000 associated deaths (405 000-834 000) in 1990, to 1.03 million associated deaths (909 000-1.16 million) in 2021, and from 127 000 attributable deaths (82 100-171 000) in 1990, to 216 000 (168 000-264 000) attributable deaths in 2021. There was a notable decrease in non-COVID-related infectious disease in 2020 and 2021. Our forecasts show that an estimated 1.91 million (1.56-2.26) deaths attributable to AMR and 8.22 million (6.85-9.65) deaths associated with AMR could occur globally in 2050. Super-regions with the highest all-age AMR mortality rate in 2050 are forecasted to be south Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean. Increases in deaths attributable to AMR will be largest among those 70 years and older (65.9% [61.2-69.8] of all-age deaths attributable to AMR in 2050). In stark contrast to the strong increase in number of deaths due to AMR of 69.6% (51.5-89.2) from 2022 to 2050, the number of DALYs showed a much smaller increase of 9.4% (-6.9 to 29.0) to 46.5 million (37.7 to 57.3) in 2050. Under the better care scenario, across all age groups, 92.0 million deaths (82.8-102.0) could be cumulatively averted between 2025 and 2050, through better care of severe infections and improved access to antibiotics, and under the Gram-negative drug scenario, 11.1 million AMR deaths (9.08-13.2) could be averted through the development of a Gram-negative drug pipeline to prevent AMR deaths. INTERPRETATION: This study presents the first comprehensive assessment of the global burden of AMR from 1990 to 2021, with results forecasted until 2050. Evaluating changing trends in AMR mortality across time and location is necessary to understand how this important global health threat is developing and prepares us to make informed decisions regarding interventions. Our findings show the importance of infection prevention, as shown by the reduction of AMR deaths in those younger than 5 years. Simultaneously, our results underscore the concerning trend of AMR burden among those older than 70 years, alongside a rapidly ageing global community. The opposing trends in the burden of AMR deaths between younger and older individuals explains the moderate future increase in global number of DALYs versus number of deaths. Given the high variability of AMR burden by location and age, it is important that interventions combine infection prevention, vaccination, minimisation of inappropriate antibiotic use in farming and humans, and research into new antibiotics to mitigate the number of AMR deaths that are forecasted for 2050.

Yet, studies on spatial and temporal distribution of tyhoid fever are lacking. This study was conducted to analyze retrospective hospital-based data at the village level over the period 2017-2023 to understand the spatial and temporal variation of typhoid fever in Jakarta. Spatial analyses were performed by Moran's I and Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) to examine spatial clustering of typhoid incidence and to identify high-risk villages for typhoid fever, respectively. Seasonal decomposition analysis was performed to investigate the seasonality of this infection. A total of 57,468 typhoid cases, resulting in a cumulative incidence of 533.99 per 100,000 people, were reported during the study period. The incidence was significantly clustered (I=0.548; p=0.001) at the village level across Jakarta. Statistically significant high-risk clusters were detected in the South and East of Jakarta that were heterogeneous over time. We identified seven persistent high-risk clusters in the eastern part of the city and two in the southern part. Moreover, the typhoid incidence showed a strong seasonality trend, significantly associated with monthly total rainfall (p=0.018). The study revealed a significant spatial variation with strong seasonality in typhoid incidence across the city suggesting a variation in transmission intensity and needs for effective public health interventions, especially in the high-risk areas. Improvement in water and sanitation facilities, hygiene awareness and surveillance are essential to help reduce typhoid transmission in Jakarta.","Mujiyanto M, Rachmat B, Yulianto A, Nurjana MA, Ridwan W, Astuti EP, Lasut D, Dhewantara PW",Geospat Health,2025 Jan 23,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
16409664,"Helicobacter pylori infection and typhoid fever in Jakarta, Indonesia.","We evaluated the association between typhoid fever and Helicobacter pylori infection, as the latter microorganism may influence gastric acid secretion and consequently increase susceptibility to Salmonella typhi infection. Anti-H. pylori IgG and IgA antibody titres (ELISA) and gastrin concentration (RIA) were determined in the plasma of 87 blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever cases (collected after clinical recovery) and 232 random healthy controls without a history of typhoid fever, in the Jatinegara district, Jakarta. Patients with typhoid fever more often than controls were seropositive for H. pylori IgG (67% vs. 50%, P<0.008), when antibody titres were dichotomized around median titres observed in controls. H. pylori IgA seropositivity was not associated with typhoid fever. Plasma gastrin concentrations indicative of hypochlorhydria (i.e. gastrin > or =25 or > or =100 ng/l) were not significantly elevated in typhoid fever cases compared to controls (P=0.54 and P=0.27 respectively). In a multivariate analysis, typhoid fever was independently associated with young age (<33 years, median age of the controls) [odds ratio (OR) 7.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.90-16.10], and H. pylori IgG seropositivity (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.10-3.40). Typhoid fever was independently associated with H. pylori IgG seropositivity, but not with elevated gastrin concentration. Therefore, the association suggests a common risk of environmental exposure to both bacteria, e.g. poor hygiene, rather than a causal relationship via reduced gastric acid production.","Vollaard AM, Verspaget HW, Ali S, Visser LG, Veenendaal RA, Van Asten HA, Widjaja S, Surjadi Ch, Van Dissel JT",Epidemiol Infect,2006 Feb,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
24448337,Typhoid fever as a triggering factor in acute and intractable bronchial asthma attack.,"Typhoid fever is an enteric infection caused by Salmonella typhi. In Indonesia, typhoid fever is endemic with high incidence of the disease. In daily practice we frequently have patients with bronchial asthma, and it is becoming worse when these patients get typhoid fever. After oral ingestion, Salmonella typhi invades the the intestine mucosa after conducted by microbial binding to epithelial cells, destroying the microfold cells (M cell) then passed through the lamina propria and detected by dendritic cells (DC) which express a variety of pathogen recognition receptors on the surfaces, including Toll-Like Receptor (TLR). expressed on macrophages and on intestinal epithelial cells inducing degradation of IB, and translocation of NF-B (Nuclear Factor-Kappa Beta). This process initiates the induction of pro-inflammatory gene expression profile adhesion molecules, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and other proteins that induce and perpetuate the inflammation in host cells then will induce acute ant intractable attack of bronchial asthma. The role of typhoid fever in bronchial asthma, especially in persons with acute attack of bronchial asthma, is not well understood. In this article, we will discuss the role of typhoid fever in the bronchial asthma patients which may cause bronchial asthma significantly become more severe even triggering the acute and intractable attack of bronchial asthma. This fact makes an important point, to treat completely the typhoid fever in patients with bronchial asthma.","Wardhana, Surachmanto EE, Datau EA",Acta Med Indones,2013 Oct,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
15173152,"Risk factors for typhoid and paratyphoid fever in Jakarta, Indonesia.","CONTEXT: The proportion of paratyphoid fever cases to typhoid fever cases may change due to urbanization and increased dependency on food purchased from street vendors. For containment of paratyphoid a different strategy may be needed than for typhoid, because risk factors for disease may not coincide and current typhoid vaccines do not protect against paratyphoid fever. OBJECTIVE: To determine risk factors for typhoid and paratyphoid fever in an endemic area. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Community-based case-control study conducted from June 2001 to February 2003 in hospitals and outpatient health centers in Jatinegara district, Jakarta, Indonesia. Enrolled participants were 1019 consecutive patients with fever lasting 3 or more days, from which 69 blood culture-confirmed typhoid cases, 24 confirmed paratyphoid cases, and 289 control patients with fever but without Salmonella bacteremia were interviewed, plus 378 randomly selected community controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blood culture-confirmed typhoid or paratyphoid fever; risk factors for both diseases. RESULTS: In 1019 fever patients we identified 88 (9%) Salmonella typhi and 26 (3%) Salmonella paratyphi A infections. Paratyphoid fever among cases was independently associated with consumption of food from street vendors (comparison with community controls: odds ratio [OR], 3.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.41-7.91; with fever controls: OR, 5.17; 95% CI, 2.12-12.60) and flooding (comparison with community controls: OR, 4.52; 95% CI, 1.90-10.73; with fever controls: OR, 3.25; 95% CI, 1.31-8.02). By contrast, independent risk factors for typhoid fever using the community control group were mostly related to the household, ie, to recent typhoid fever in the household (OR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.03-5.48); no use of soap for handwashing (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.06-3.46); sharing food from the same plate (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.10-3.37), and no toilet in the household (OR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.06-4.55). Also, typhoid fever was associated with young age in years (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.94-0.98). In comparison with fever controls, risk factors for typhoid fever were use of ice cubes (OR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.31-3.93) and female sex (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.04-3.06). Fecal contamination of drinking water was not associated with typhoid or paratyphoid fever. We did not detect fecal carriers among food handlers in the households. CONCLUSIONS: In Jakarta, typhoid and paratyphoid fever are associated with distinct routes of transmission, with the risk factors for disease either mainly within the household (typhoid) or outside the household (paratyphoid).","Vollaard AM, Ali S, van Asten HA, Widjaja S, Visser LG, Surjadi C, van Dissel JT",JAMA,2004 Jun 2,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
24385413,Vaccines for preventing typhoid fever.,"BACKGROUND: Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever continue to be important causes of illness and death, particularly among children and adolescents in south-central and southeast Asia. Two typhoid vaccines are commercially available, Ty21a (oral) and Vi polysaccharide (parenteral), but neither is used routinely. Other vaccines, such as a new, modified, conjugated Vi vaccine called Vi-rEPA, are in development. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and adverse effects of vaccines used to prevent typhoid fever. SEARCH METHODS: In June 2013, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and mRCT. We also searched relevant conference proceedings up to 2013 and scanned the reference lists of all included trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing typhoid fever vaccines with other typhoid fever vaccines or with an inactive agent (placebo or vaccine for a different disease). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently applied inclusion criteria and extracted data. We computed vaccine efficacy per year of follow-up and cumulative three-year efficacy, stratifying for vaccine type and dose. The outcome addressed was typhoid fever, defined as isolation of Salmonella typhi in blood. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and efficacy (1-RR as a percentage) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). MAIN RESULTS: In total, 18 RCTs were included in this review; 12 evaluated efficacy (Ty21a: five trials; Vi polysaccharide: six trials; Vi-rEPA: one trial), and 11 reported on adverse events. Ty21a vaccine (oral vaccine, three doses) A three-dose schedule of Ty21a vaccine prevents around one-third to one-half of typhoid cases in the first two years after vaccination (Year 1: 35%, 95% CI 8% to 54%; Year 2: 58%, 95% CI 40% to 71%; one trial, 20,543 participants; moderate quality evidence; data taken from a single trial conducted in Indonesia in the 1980s). No benefit was detected in the third year after vaccination. Four additional cluster-RCTs have been conducted, but the study authors did not adjust for clustering.Compared with placebo, this vaccine was not associated with more participants with vomiting, diarrhoea, nausea or abdominal pain (four trials, 2066 participants; moderate quality evidence) headache, or rash (two trials, 1190 participants; moderate quality evidence); however, fever (four trials, 2066 participants; moderate quality evidence) was more common in the vaccine group. Vi polysaccharide vaccine (injection, one dose) A single dose of Vi polysaccharide vaccine prevents around two-thirds of typhoid cases in the first year after vaccination (Year 1: 69%, 95% CI 63% to 74%; three trials, 99,979 participants; high quality evidence). In Year 2, the trial results were more variable, with the vaccine preventing between 45% and 69% of typhoid cases (Year 2: 59%, 95% CI 45% to 69%; four trials, 194,969 participants; moderate quality evidence). The three-year cumulative efficacy of the vaccine is around 55% (95% CI 30% to 70%; 11,384 participants, one trial; moderate quality evidence). These data are taken from a single trial in South Africa in the 1980s.Compared with placebo, this vaccine was not associated with more participants with fever (four trials, 133,038 participants; moderate quality evidence) or erythema (three trials, 132,261 participants; low quality evidence); however, swelling (three trials, 1767 participants; moderate quality evidence) and pain at the injection site (one trial, 667 participants; moderate quality evidence) were more common in the vaccine group. Vi-rEPA vaccine (two doses) Administration of two doses of the Vi-rEPA vaccine prevents between 50% and 96% of typhoid cases during the first two years after vaccination (Year 1: 94%, 95% CI 75% to 99%; Year 2: 87%, 95% CI 56% to 96%; one trial, 12,008 participants; moderate quality evidence). These data are taken from a single trial with children 2 to 5 years of age conducted in Vietnam.Compared with placebo, the first and second doses of this vaccine were not associated with increased risk of adverse events. The first dose of this vaccine was not associated with fever (2 studies, 12,209 participants; low quality evidence), erythema (two trials, 12,209 participants; moderate quality evidence) or swelling at the injection site (two trials, 12,209 participants; moderate quality evidence). The second dose of this vaccine was not associated with fever (two trials, 11,286 participants; low quality evidence), erythema (two trials, 11,286 participants; moderate quality evidence) and swelling at the injection site (two trials, 11,286 participants; moderate quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The licensed Ty21a and Vi polysaccharide vaccines are efficacious. The new and unlicensed Vi-rEPA vaccine is as efficacious and may confer longer immunity.","Anwar E, Goldberg E, Fraser A, Acosta CJ, Paul M, Leibovici L",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,2014 Jan 2,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
38917139,"The cost of typhoid illness in low- and middle-income countries, a scoping review of the literature.","Typhoid fever is responsible for a substantial health burden in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). New means of prevention became available with the prequalification of typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCV) by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2018. Policymakers require evidence to inform decisions about TCV. The economic burden related to typhoid fever can be considerable, both for healthcare providers and households, and should be accounted for in the decision-making process. We aimed to understand the breadth of the evidence on the cost of typhoid fever by undertaking a scoping review of the published literature. We searched scientific databases with terms referring to typhoid fever cost of illness to identify published studies for the period January 1st 2000 to May 24th 2024. We also conferred with stakeholders engaged in typhoid research to identify studies pending completion or publication. We identified 13 published studies reporting empirical data for 11 countries, most of them located in Asia. The total cost of a typhoid episode ranged from $23 in India to $884 in Indonesia (current 2022 United States Dollar [USD]). Household expenditures related to typhoid fever were characterized as catastrophic in 9 studies. We identified 5 studies pending completion or publication, which will provide evidence for 9 countries, most of them located in Africa. Alignment in study characteristics and methods would increase the usefulness of the evidence generated and facilitate cross-country and regional comparison. The gap in evidence across regions should be mitigated when studies undertaken in African countries are published. There remains a lack of evidence on the cost to treat typhoid in the context of increasing antimicrobial resistance. Decision-makers should consider the available evidence on the economic burden of typhoid, particularly as risk factors related to antimicrobial resistance and climate change increase typhoid risk. Additional studies should address typhoid illness costs, using standardized methods and accounting for the costs of antimicrobial resistance.","Debellut F, Friedrich A, Baral R, Pecenka C, Mugisha E, Neuzil KM",PLoS One,2024,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
37172043,Validation of the Nelwan Score as a screening tool for the diagnosis of typhoid fever in adults in Indonesia.,"INTRODUCTION: Typhoid fever diagnosis is challenging for clinicians in areas with limited laboratory facilities. Scoring methods based on signs and symptoms are useful for screening for probable cases of typhoid fever. The Nelwan Score variables are derived from the clinical signs and symptoms of patients with suspected typhoid. We validated the Nelwan Score compared to laboratory tests as the gold standard. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted between July 2017 and January 2018 in five hospitals and two primary health care centers in Jakarta and Tangerang, Indonesia. Patients with fever for 3-14 days and gastrointestinal symptoms were evaluated using the Nelwan Score. Blood cultures, samples for polymerase chain reaction testing, and additional rectal swab cultures were collected simultaneously to confirm the diagnosis of typhoid. Data were analyzed using a contingency table to measure sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV), and the optimal cut-off of the Nelwan Score for typhoid diagnosis was determined using a receiver-operating characteristic curve. RESULT: Typhoid was confirmed in 11 of the 233 patients (4.7%) with suspected typhoid. Among laboratory-confirmed typhoid cases, the median Nelwan Score was 11 (range: 9-13) and the optimal cut-off value was 10, with an area under the curve of 71.3%, sensitivity of 81.8%, specificity of 60.8%, PPV of 9.3%, and NPV of 98.5%. CONCLUSION: A Nelwan Score of 10 is the best cut-off value for screening for typhoid fever. It is useful as screening tool for typhoid fever, where laboratory resources are limited, and could help to decrease irrational antibiotic use.","Nelwan EJ, Paramita LPL, Sinto R, Subekti D, Hosea FN, Nugroho P, Pohan HT",PLoS One,2023,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
15837356,"Identification of typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever cases at presentation in outpatient clinics in Jakarta, Indonesia.","In Jakarta, Indonesia, over 80% of patients with typhoid fever or paratyphoid fever are treated in outpatient settings. In a community-based prospective passive surveillance study, we identified 59 typhoid, 23 paratyphoid fever and 259 non-enteric fever outpatients, all blood culture-confirmed. We compared their symptoms with the aim of developing a clinical prediction rule that may help direct empirical antibiotic treatment to cases with suspected (para)typhoid fever, rather than all febrile patients, or refer patients for additional diagnostic tests. Paratyphoid fever (Salmonella paratyphi A) could not be distinguished clinically from typhoid fever. Decisions on empirical antibiotic treatment and advice on hygiene measures in patients with suspected (para)typhoid fever should take into account chills and absence of cough in the first week of fever and delirium in the second week of illness. This prediction rule increases the likelihood of (para)typhoid fever from 1:10 in the first week to, at most, 2:3 in the second week of a febrile illness. However, we were not able to propose a robust clinical prediction rule that could be used as absolute screening method for decisions on additional diagnostic tests, because of the low sensitivity of presenting symptoms in (para)typhoid fever.","Vollaard AM, Ali S, Widjaja S, Asten HA, Visser LG, Surjadi C, van Dissel JT",Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,2005 Jun,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
9391512,"Typhoid fever in Ujung Pandang, Indonesia--high-risk groups and high-risk behaviours.","We performed a hospital-based case-control study to identify high risk groups and routes of transmission of typhoid fever in the city of Ujung Pandang on the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia. The annual incidence of this disease in southern Sulawesi is estimated at 3.1/1000 and the case fatality at 5.1% Cases were 50 patients over 13 years of age admitted to Stella Maris Hospital with a diagnosis of typhoid fever between June and September 1991. Diagnosis was made on clinical grounds and in 90% of cases confirmed by a Widal test. Controls were 42 patients admitted for non-infectious disorders during the same period and individually matched by age and sex. Controls did not have a history of typhoid fever. Interviews took place in hospital. Analysis was by unconditional logistic regression. High-risk groups consisted of those who were single, unemployed and those who had a university education. Median age of cases was 22 years. Consumption of food from warungs (food stalls in the street) was strongly associated with risk (OR = 45). Both cases and controls washed hands after use of the toilet and before meals, but cases used soap significantly less often (OR = 30). The results of this study can be used to take preventive measures against this severe disease of educated and single young adults by targetting them for IEC-activities emphasizing the importance of thorough hand-washing and the need to take care in the selection of street-foods.","Velema JP, van Wijnen G, Bult P, van Naerssen T, Jota S",Trop Med Int Health,1997 Nov,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
20398409,"Characteristics and risk factors for typhoid fever after the tsunami, earthquake and under normal conditions in Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: Although typhoid transmitted by food and water is a common problem in daily life, its characteristics and risk factors may differ in disaster-affected areas, which reinforces the need for rapid public health intervention. Surveys were carried out post-tsunami in Banda Aceh, post-earthquake in Yogyakarta, and under normal conditions in Bandung, Indonesia. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the risk factors with the dependent variable of typhoid fever, with or without complications. FINDINGS: Characteristic typhoid fever with complications was found in 5 patients (11.9%) affected by the tsunami in Aceh, 8 (20.5%) after the earthquake in Yogyakarta, and 13 (18.6%) in Bandung. After the tsunami in Aceh, clean water (OR = 0.05; 95%CI: 0.01-0.47) and drug availability (OR = 0.23; 95%CI: 0.02-2.43) are significant independent risk factors, while for the earthquake in Yogyakarta, contact with other typhoid patients (OR = 20.30; 95%CI: 1.93-213.02) and education (OR = 0.08; 95%CI: 0.01-0.98) were significant risk factors. Under normal conditions in Bandung, hand washing (OR = 0.07; 95%CI: 0.01-0.50) and education (OR = 0.08; 95%CI: 0.01-0.64) emerged as significant risk factors. CONCLUSION: The change in risk factors for typhoid complication after the tsunami in Aceh and the earthquake in Yogyakarta emphasizes the need for rapid public health intervention in natural disasters in Indonesia.","Sutiono AB, Qiantori A, Suwa H, Ohta T",BMC Res Notes,2010 Apr 17,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
35079365,Sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation are rare complications of typhoid fever: A case report.,"INTRODUCTION: and importance: Typhoid fever is an infection caused by Salmonella typhi. The common complications are intestinal perforation and typhoid encephalopathy. Cases of typhoid fever with sepsis and/or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) are rarely reported, even though typhoid fever is endemic in Indonesia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 4-year-old male referral case from a district hospital was experiencing fever, decrease of consciousness and massive bleeding from his gastrointestinal tract and nose. Investigation revealed results from the IgM typhoid test using Tubex(R)TF, with the score of +8. PELOD 2 score was 10, and PSOFA was 5. DIC score was 7. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with typhoid fever, with DIC and sepsis being the complication of the typhoid fever. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: DIC is mostly a subclinical event, and severe bleeding complications found in typhoid fever are uncommon, although DIC scores which indicate an imbalance of coagulation and fibrinolysis are markedly elevated in patients with typhoid. DIC can be a part of multi-organ dysfunction due to sepsis syndrome. Acute infection can also result in systemic activation of coagulation. CONCLUSION: Sepsis and DIC are rare complications of typhoid fever. Typhoid fever can be presented with profound bleeding manifestation other than gastrointestinal bleeding, since it is a common symptom of typhoid fever. Further research should be conducted to postulate association between typhoid fever and DIC.","Nurnaningsih, William V, Rusmawatiningtyas D, Makrufardi F, Kumara IF",Ann Med Surg (Lond),2022 Jan,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
1681365,Oral immunisation against typhoid fever in Indonesia with Ty21a vaccine.,"When tested under conditions of moderate transmission of typhoid fever, a liquid formulation of the oral typhoid fever vaccine Ty21a had a protective efficacy of 96% in Egypt, and an enteric coated capsule formulation had an efficacy of 67% in Chile. We compared the two formulations under conditions of intense transmission of typhoid fever in Indonesia in a randomised, double-blind trial. 20,543 subjects (age range 3-44 years) received either three doses of enteric coated capsules containing placebo or live Ty21a, or three doses of lyophilised placebo or live Ty21a reconstituted with phosphate buffer. During 30 months of follow-up, the rate of blood-culture-positive typhoid fever among controls was 810/100,000 per year. Rates of typhoid fever were 379/100,000 per year for subjects who received the liquid formulation of vaccine and 468/100,000 per year for subjects who received enteric coated capsules. The protective efficacies of the liquid and enteric coated formulations were 53% and 42%, respectively. Neither formulation protected against infection with Salmonella paratyphi A. No major side-effects were noted, but the overall incidence of side-effects was greater in the vaccine groups. Under conditions of intense transmission, Ty21a protected against typhoid fever; however, because Ty21a will not protect all individuals, there is a need for additional approaches to prevent the disease.","Simanjuntak CH, Paleologo FP, Punjabi NH, Darmowigoto R, Soeprawoto, Totosudirjo H, Haryanto P, Suprijanto E, Witham ND, Hoffman SL",Lancet,1991 Oct 26,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
10223217,Outcome in three groups of patients with typhoid fever in Indonesia between 1948 and 1990.,"The outcome in three groups of patients with bacteriologically confirmed typhoid fever caused by Salmonella typhi, treated during three episodes between 1948 and 1990 in Java, Indonesia, was compared by retrospective analysis of hospital records. The study population consisted of three groups of patients. Group I (n = 50) was treated in Batavia (the present Jakarta) from 1948 to 1950, Group II (n = 61) in Yogyakarta from 1952 to 1956, Group III (n = 105) in Semarang from 1989 to 1990. Main outcome measures were days until defervescence, early relapses during hospitalization, duration of hospital stay, complications and mortality. Group I received supportive treatment only, Group II low doses of chloramphenicol (total 12.5 g) and Group III full doses of chloramphenicol (total 27 g); occasionally other antibiotics were used. In Group I, II and III the mean number of days until defervescence was 16, 8 and 6 and the mean number of days in hospital 43, 47 and 15, respectively. Mortality was 26%, 10% and 5% and complications occurred in 38%, 18% and 13%, respectively. Between Group I and Group II the differences in mortality and complications were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Compared to Group I the proportion of early relapses was higher in Group II, but was zero in Group III. There were significantly fewer gastrointestinal complications in Group II than in Group I (P < 0.01) and even fewer in Group III. When no antibiotic against S. typhi was available, typhoid fever had a protracted course, and only 74% of patients survived. Even with low dosages of chloramphenicol, defervescence was earlier and mortality and complications decreased dramatically, but early relapses were frequent. Full doses of chloramphenicol for a sufficient period of time only slightly reduced mortality and complications further, but eliminated early relapses completely.","van den Bergh ET, Gasem MH, Keuter M, Dolmans MV",Trop Med Int Health,1999 Mar,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
18438514,A study of typhoid fever in five Asian countries: disease burden and implications for controls.,"OBJECTIVE: To inform policy-makers about introduction of preventive interventions against typhoid, including vaccination. METHODS: A population-based prospective surveillance design was used. Study sites where typhoid was considered a problem by local authorities were established in China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan and Viet Nam. Standardized clinical, laboratory, and surveillance methods were used to investigate cases of fever of >or= 3 days' duration for a one-year period. A total of 441,435 persons were under surveillance, 159,856 of whom were aged 5-15 years. FINDINGS: A total of 21,874 episodes of fever were detected. Salmonella typhi was isolated from 475 (2%) blood cultures, 57% (273/475) of which were from 5-15 year-olds. The annual typhoid incidence (per 100,000 person years) among this age group varied from 24.2 and 29.3 in sites in Viet Nam and China, respectively, to 180.3 in the site in Indonesia; and to 412.9 and 493.5 in sites in Pakistan and India, respectively. Altogether, 23% (96/413) of isolates were multidrug resistant (chloramphenicol, ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole). CONCLUSION: The incidence of typhoid varied substantially between sites, being high in India and Pakistan, intermediate in Indonesia, and low in China and Viet Nam. These findings highlight the considerable, but geographically heterogeneous, burden of typhoid fever in endemic areas of Asia, and underscore the importance of evidence on disease burden in making policy decisions about interventions to control this disease.","Ochiai RL, Acosta CJ, Danovaro-Holliday MC, Baiqing D, Bhattacharya SK, Agtini MD, Bhutta ZA, Canh DG, Ali M, Shin S, Wain J, Page AL, Albert MJ, Farrar J, Abu-Elyazeed R, Pang T, Galindo CM, von Seidlein L, Clemens JD",Bull World Health Organ,2008 Apr,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia

11422963,"Poor food hygiene and housing as risk factors for typhoid fever in Semarang, Indonesia.","To identify risk factors for typhoid fever in Semarang city and its surroundings, 75 culture-proven typhoid fever patients discharged 2 weeks earlier from hospital and 75 controls were studied. Control subjects were neighbours of cases with no history of typhoid fever, not family members, randomly selected and matched for gender and age. Both cases and controls were interviewed at home by the same trained interviewer using a standardized questionnaire. A structured observation of their living environment inside and outside the house was performed during the visit and home drinking water samples were tested bacteriologically. Univariate analysis showed the following risk factors for typhoid fever: never or rarely washing hands before eating (OR = 3.28; 95% CI = 1.41-7.65); eating outdoors at least once a week (OR = 3.00; 95% CI = 1.09-8.25); eating outdoors at a street food stall or mobile food vendor (OR = 3.86; 95% CI = 1.30-11.48); consuming ice cubes in beverage in the 2-week period before getting ill (OR = 3.00, 95% CI = 1.09-8.25) and buying ice cubes from a street vendor (OR = 5.82; 95% CI = 1.69-20.12). Water quality and living environment of cases were worse than that of controls, e.g. cases less often used clean water for taking a bath (OR = 6.50; 95% CI = 1.47-28.80), for brushing teeth (OR = 4.33; 95% CI = 1.25-15.20) and for drinking (OR = 3.67; 95% CI = 1.02-13.14). Cases tended to live in houses without water supply from the municipal network (OR=11.00; 95% CI = 1.42-85.2), with open sewers (OR = 2.80; 95% CI = 1.0-7.77) and without tiles in the kitchen (OR = 2.67; 95% CI = 1.04-6.81).

27905890,"Low and declining attack rates of imported typhoid fever in the Netherlands 1997-2014, in spite of a restricted vaccination policy.","BACKGROUND: Typhoid fever mainly occurs in (sub) tropical regions where sanitary conditions remain poor. In other regions it occurs mainly among returning travelers or their direct contacts. The aim of this study was to evaluate the current Dutch guidelines for typhoid vaccination. METHOD: Crude annual attack rates (AR) per 100,000 Dutch travelers were calculated during the period 1997 to 2014 by dividing the number of typhoid fever cases by the estimated total number of travelers to a specific country or region. Regions of exposure and possible risk factors were evaluated. RESULTS: During the study period 607 cases of typhoid fever were reported. Most cases were imported from Asia (60%). Almost half of the cases were ethnically related to typhoid risk regions and 37% were cases visiting friends and relatives. The overall ARs for travelers to all regions declined significantly. Countries with the highest ARs were India (29 per 100,000), Indonesia (8 per 100,000), and Morocco (10 per 100,000). There was a significant decline in ARs among travelers to popular travel destinations such as Morocco, Turkey, and Indonesia. ARs among travelers to intermediate-risk areas according to the Dutch guidelines such as Latin America or Sub-Saharan Africa remained very low, despite the restricted vaccination policy for these areas compared to many other guidelines. CONCLUSION: The overall AR of typhoid fever among travelers returning to the Netherlands is very low and has declined in the past 20 years. The Dutch vaccination policy not to vaccinate short-term travelers to Latin-America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Thailand and Malaysia seems to be justified, because the ARs for these destinations remain very low. These results suggest that further restriction of the Dutch vaccination policy is justified.","Suryapranata FS, Prins M, Sonder GJ",BMC Infect Dis,2016 Dec 1,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia

Patient age ranges from 0-19 years. Antibiotic analysis is the best effectiveness using the ACER method. RESULTS: He results of the patient characteristics show that the children of patients who suffer from typhoid fever, the highest age is 12-16 years (50%), by gender male 60% and female 40%. Patients hospitalized using chloramfenicol averaged 6.53 days (7 days) while ceftriaxon averaged 4.17 days. The average number of direct medical costs in pediatric patients suffering from typhoid fever using cloramfenikol was 3,212,776/patient while ceftriaxon 1,967,045/patient. Cost effectiveness analysis using ACER method obtained results for cloramenicenicol at 492.002/day and ceftriaxon 471,713/day. CONCLUSON: Ceftriaxone has a better treatment effectiveness compared to chloramphenicol in typhoid fever patients in children.","Dasopang ES, Hasanah F, Bakri TK, Isma M",Open Access Maced J Med Sci,2019 Nov 30,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
16734611,PARK2/PACRG polymorphisms and susceptibility to typhoid and paratyphoid fever.,"Host genetic factors may contribute to susceptibility to and outcome in infectious diseases. Recently polymorphisms in PARK2/PACRG, a gene cluster linked to ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated protein degradation, were found to be associated with manifest infection by M. leprae. Here, we address whether these polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to infection with Salmonella typhi and S. paratyphi A, intracellular pathogens that upon infection of humans share with mycobacteria aspects of the hosts' immune response. The polymorphisms of PARK_e01(-697), PARK2_e01(-2599), rs1333955 and rs1040079 were analysed by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism in a case-control study of typhoid and paratyphoid fever patients in an endemic area in Jakarta, Indonesia. For this study, samples were obtained from patients with blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever (n=90), paratyphoid fever (n=26) and fever controls (n=337) in a passive, community-based surveillance and compared to those of randomly selected community controls (n=322) from the same city area. The PARK2_e01(-2599) allele T was significantly associated with typhoid and paratyphoid fever (OR: 1.51, 95%CI: 1.02-2.23) but the other polymorphisms, PARK2_e01(-697), rs1333955 and rs1040079, were not associated. Although within the PARK2/PACRG gene cluster the PARK2_e01(-2599) allele T was most strongly associated with leprosy (OR approximately 3-5), the association with typhoid is much less strong. Our findings suggest that this polymorphism in PARK2/PACRG plays a small but significant role in susceptibility to the intracellular pathogens S. typhi and S. paratyphi.","Ali S, Vollaard AM, Widjaja S, Surjadi C, van de Vosse E, van Dissel JT",Clin Exp Immunol,2006 Jun,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
18276100,"Simple, rapid, and affordable point-of-care test for the serodiagnosis of typhoid fever.","We developed a point-of-care test for the serodiagnosis of typhoid fever in the format of an immunochromatographic lateral flow assay. The flow assay for typhoid fever is based on the detection of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi lipopolysaccharide-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. The assay was evaluated on serum samples collected in a hospital in South Sulawesi, Indonesia, where typhoid fever is endemic, and the results were compared with culture and Widal test. The sensitivity of this typhoid fever IgM flow assay for samples collected at 1st diagnosis from patients with culture-confirmed typhoid fever was determined to be 59.3%. The sensitivity ranged from 41.2% to 89.5%, depending on the duration of illness. A specificity of 97.8% was calculated based on results obtained for patients with clinical suspicion of typhoid fever that was later excluded. The assay is ideal for use as a point-of-care test in health care centers that lack the expertise and facilities to perform culture or the less specific Widal test. Because of its simplicity, the assay may also be used as a field test in remote areas.","Pastoor R, Hatta M, Abdoel TH, Smits HL",Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,2008 Jun,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
15673941,"Clinical and laboratory manifestations of typhoid fever at Persahabatan Hospital, Jakarta.","AIM: To determine clinical, and therapeutic characteristics, and antibiotic susceptibility test results for typhoid fever. METHODS: A retrospective study using data from medical records of all typhoid fever subjects which is confirmed by blood culture positive for S. typhi or S. paratyphi. This study was performed to determine clinical, laboratory, and therapeutic characteristics. Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired student t-test. RESULTS: Out of 119 subjects, 58.8% were male and 41.2% were female. The average age was 24.98 years (SD 11.11). Predominant symptoms were headache, epigastric pain, nausea, anorexia, together with fever from the afternoon to night. Predominant laboratory abnormalities were decreased or normal leukocyte count, increased of SGOT/SGPT, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, thrombocytopenia, and proteinuria. Predominant widal test results for antigen O and H were 1/320. Four time elevations of widal titer were rare in this study. Typhoid hepatitis, typhoid pneumonia, typhoid encephalopathy, intestinal haemorrhage are the most frequent complications in this study. Chloramphenicol is still effective for typhoid fever. CONCLUSION: From this study, it can be concluded that headache, epigastric pain, nausea, decreased appetite together with fever in the evening/at night with normal/decreased leukocyte count and abnormal liver function are the most common clinical symptoms found in typhoid subjects.",Pohan HT,Acta Med Indones,2004 Apr-Jun,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
24240034,"Enteric fever burden in North Jakarta, Indonesia: a prospective, community-based study.","INTRODUCTION: We undertook a prospective community-based study in North Jakarta, Indonesia, to determine the incidence, clinical characteristics, seasonality, etiologic agent, and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of enteric fever. METHODOLOGY: Following a census, treatment centre-based surveillance for febrile illness was conducted for two-years. Clinical data and a blood culture were obtained from each patient. RESULTS: In a population of 160,261, we detected 296 laboratory-confirmed enteric fever cases during the surveillance period, of which 221 (75%) were typhoid fever and 75 (25%)  were paratyphoid fever.  The overall incidence of typhoid and paratyphoid cases was 1.4, and 0.5 per thousand populations per year, respectively. Although the incidence of febrile episodes evaluated was highest among children under 5 years of age at 92.6 per thousand persons per year, we found that the burden of typhoid fever was greatest among children between 5 and 20 years of age. Paratyphoid fever occurred most commonly in children and was infrequent in adults. CONCLUSION: Enteric fever is a public health problem in North Jakarta with a substantial proportion due to paratyphoid fever. The results highlight the need for control strategies against enteric fever.","Punjabi NH, Agtini MD, Ochiai RL, Simanjuntak CH, Lesmana M, Subekti D, Oyofo BA, von Seidlein L, Deen J, Shin S, Acosta C, Wangsasaputra F, Pulungsih SP, Saroso S, Suyeti S, R S, Sudarmono P, Syarurachman A, Suwandono A, Arjoso S, Beecham HJ 3rd, Corwin AL, Clemens JD",J Infect Dev Ctries,2013 Nov 15,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
12757221,Antibody response in typhoid fever in endemic Indonesia and the relevance of serology and culture to diagnosis.,"Culture and serology were performed on blood and serum samples collected at or shortly after admission from 473 patients presented with suspected clinical typhoid. Clinical symptoms at first presentation including confusion, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, abdominal pain, anemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding were non-specific as they were observed even more often in non-typhoid patients. Culture confirmed the diagnosis in 65.3% of the patients with typhoid fever as the final diagnosis. The sensitivity (58%) and specificity (98.1%) of a rapid dipstick assay for the detection of S. typhi-specific immunoglobulin M were somewhat lower than those of culture but higher than those of the Widal test. The dipstick assay thus may well be used in the serodiagnosis of typhoid in situation where culture facilities are not available. Combination of test results of dipstick and culture improved sensitivity to 82.5%. In laboratories that perform blood culture the dipstick assay may be used as a rapid screening tests to facilitate a rapid diagnosis. Sensitivity of the dipstick assay strongly increased with duration of illness and was higher for culture positive than for culture negative patients. Duration of illness, and different pathogen and host factors including dose of infection, pathogenicity and antigenicity, and prior antibiotic use are likely to influence the immune response, therefore the result of the dipstick assay. Duration of illness and presence of S. typhi in the blood are major factors that determine severity of disease.","Hatta M, Mubin H, Abdoel T, Smits HL",Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health,2002 Dec,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
17477815,Polymorphisms in proinflammatory genes and susceptibility to typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever.,"Host genetic factors are thought to contribute to susceptibility and outcome in infectious diseases. A polymorphism in a proinflammatory gene, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFA - 308), was recently found to be associated with susceptibility to typhoid fever. As the observation was made in hospitalized patients, a potential confounder could be that the TNFA polymorphism is associated with the severity of established illness resulting in hospital admission rather than susceptibility to disease. We tested whether the association with TNFA - 308 is present also in typhoid fever patients enrolled in a community-based case-control study in an endemic area in Indonesia. Common polymorphisms in other proinflammatory genes were assayed as well. Samples of patients with blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever (n = 90) and paratyphoid fever (n = 26) and fever controls (n = 337) were compared with those of community controls (n = 322). In these groups, we analyzed polymorphisms in TNFA by PCR and RFLP, polymorphisms of IFNG, IL1A, IL1B, IL1R1, TNFRSF1A, CASP1, and CRP by Sequenom MassArray (San Diego, CA), and polymorphisms in IL12B and IFNGR1 by fragment length analysis. The IL1R1 polymorphisms were nearly absent in the Indonesian population. The TNFA - 308 polymorphism was not associated with typhoid fever (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.1-1.0) in this population. The polymorphisms at TNFA - 238 or in IFNG, IL1A, IL1B, IL12B, TNFRSF1A, IFNGR1, CASP1, and CRP were also not associated with typhoid or paratyphoid fever. We conclude that polymorphisms in proinflammatory genes do not contribute to susceptibility to typhoid fever and, in view of earlier findings, suggest that the TNFA - 308 polymorphism is likely related to severity of established disease rather than to susceptibility per se.","Ali S, Vollaard AM, Kremer D, de Visser AW, Martina CA, Widjaja S, Surjadi C, Slagboom E, van de Vosse E, van Dissel JT",J Interferon Cytokine Res,2007 Apr,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
21795820,Application of a point-of-care test for the serodiagnosis of typhoid fever in Nigeria and the need for improved diagnostics.,"INTRODUCTION: There is an urgent need for affordable point-of-care diagnostics for the differentiation of febrile illnesses and the confirmation of typhoid in endemic countries. METHODOLOGY: Blood samples were collected from febrile patients with clinical suspicion of typhoid and screened for typhoid fever using the Widal and Typhi Dri Dot tests, while stool and blood samples were screened for Salmonella Typhi using the culture method as well as PCR as a confirmatory test. RESULTS: A high proportion of febrile patients from Lagos with clinical suspicion of typhoid fever reacted positively in a simple and rapid latex agglutination assay for typhoid fever, indicating that this illness is a common and presumably under-diagnosed health problem in this metropolis. Seropositivity was 19.2% in the rapid test compared with 22.9% in the classical Widal test. The confirmation of typhoid in these seropositive patients appeared cumbersome because of negative blood cultures and low DNA yield in molecular testing. A review of the literature revealed that in Nigeria seroprevalence rates can be high in the normal population and that pathogens other than S. Typhi are often isolated from the blood of seropositive febrile patients. CONCLUSION: The simplicity and the relatively high specificity (97.8%) of the rapid test as determined in a study performed in Indonesia calls for a further validation of this promising test for use in Africa.","Smith SI, Bamidele M, Fowora M, Goodluck HT, Omonigbehin EA, Akinsinde KA, Fesobi T, Pastoor R, Abdoel TH, Smits HL",J Infect Dev Ctries,2011 Jul 27,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
39052692,Clinical characteristics of enteric fever and performance of TUBEX TF IgM test in Indonesian hospitals.,"BACKGROUND: Accurate diagnosis of enteric fever is challenging, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, due to the overlap of clinical and laboratory features with other pathogens. To better understand the difficulties in enteric fever diagnosis, we evaluated the characteristics of patients clinically diagnosed with enteric fever and the real-world performance of TUBEX TF, one of the most used tests in Indonesia. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Patients were recruited through the AFIRE (Etiology of Acute Febrile Illness Requiring Hospitalization) study at eight Indonesian hospitals. Blood culture was performed for all patients, and TUBEX TF was performed for suspected enteric cases. Salmonella PCR and ELISA tests were performed at a reference lab. Sensitivity and specificity of TUBEX TF and IgM and IgG anti-S. Typhi ELISA were determined. Of 301 patients clinically diagnosed with enteric fever, 50 (16.6%) were confirmed by blood culture and/or PCR. Confirmed cases were mostly school-aged children presenting with fever, anorexia, dizziness and/or abdominal pain with normal leukocyte count or leukopenia. TUBEX TF demonstrated a sensitivity of 97.6% to 70.7% and specificity of 38.3% to 67.2% at cutoffs of 4 and 6, respectively. Acute IgG demonstrated the best sensitivity and specificity, at 90.7% and 82.7%, respectively, and the best ROC characteristics. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: A substantial proportion of enteric fever was misdiagnosed at all study hospitals, likely due to the overlap of clinical characteristics and lab parameters with those of other common pathogens. The TUBEX TF rapid serological assay demonstrated suboptimal performance in our setting and tended to over-diagnose enteric fever. The role of IgG from acute specimens for identification of enteric fever cases merits additional consideration.","Nurmawati S, Alam A, Djauhari H, Merati TP, Sudarmono P, Setiawaty V, Arlinda D, Sugiyono RI, Arief M, Hadi U, Aman AT, Lokida D, Gasem MH, Tjitra E, Liang CJ, Neal A, Kosasih H, Karyana M, Lau CY, Alisjahbana B",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,2024 Jul,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
17297206,Open study on efficacy and tolerability of ciprofloxacin XR compared with ciprofloxacin BID in the treatment of typhoid fever.,"AIM: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of ciproflaxin extended-release and ciproflaxin intermediate release in the treatment of typhoid fever. METHODS: A prospective, open labelled, clinical trial, comparing the safety and efficacy of extended-release ciprofloxacin 1000 mg once daily (Ciprofloxacin XR) and ciprofloxacin intermediate release 500 mg two times daily (Ciprofloxacin bid) was performed in adult with typhoid fever. Diagnosis for typhoid fever was based on Widal serology test, blood culture and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for Salmonella typhi. A two-sided student t-test and chi-square or Fisher's exact test were used for the analysis of clinical responses. RESULTS: Good clinical responses were obtained in 32 subjects (14 with Intermediate release ciprofloxacin and 18 with Extended-release ciprofloxacin) and there were no failure case (0%). Day to reach defervescence in Ciprofloxacin BID (mean 3.28 days) was similar to Ciprofloxacin XR group (mean 3.72 days) with p=0.43. Mild side effects were noted in 7.1% of subjects who received Ciprofloxacin BID compared by 22.2% in subjects who received Ciprofloxacin XR, with p=0.29. There were no moderate or severe side effects on both drugs. CONCLUSION: Clinical outcomes were similar for the two treatments and both treatments were well tolerated. Once daily ciprofloxacin XR was safe, effective, and non-inferior to twice-daily ciprofloxacin IR in the treatment of typhoid fever.","Suhendro, Chen K, Pohan HT",Acta Med Indones,2007 Jan-Mar,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia

METHODS: this study was held at Thalassaemia Centre, Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital Jakarta on September 2013-February 2014. A comparative cross sectional study was conducted in healthy, thalassemia major aged more than 12 year and seronegative HIV. They were matched in age and sex for splenectomised and non-splenectomised groups, analysing the non-spesific immune response (neutrophil count and phagocytosis) and specific immune response (count and function of cellular immunity). Infection episodes were also analized as immune response in vivo parameter. RESULTS: splenectomised thalassemia major showed increased neutrophil count but significantly decreased non-spesific immune response (neutrophil phagocytosis). Spesific immune response of splenectomised group presented significantly higher absolute lymphocyte, lymphocyte T, CD4+ and CD8+ counts compared to non-splenectomised thalassemia major (p<0.05). Ratio CD4+/CD8+ were similar in these groups. Serum marker of activated cellular imunity function (IL-2 and TNF-) were similar among two groups. Mild infection episodes on splenectomised and non-splenectomised group were 2.02 (ranged 0 to 12) times and 0.81 (ranged 0 to 8) times (p=0.004), respectively. Severe infection on splenectomised group were sepsis for 2 weeks and diarrhea for 1 week, whereas on non-splenectomised group was typhoid fever for 4 days. CONCLUSION: there were significant differences on immune response among thalassemia major patients. Splenectomised thalassemia major showed a greater degree of susceptibility to infections than non-splenectomised thalassemia major.","Sari TT, Gatot D, Akib AA, Bardosono S, Hadinegoro SR, Harahap AR, Idjradinata PS",Acta Med Indones,2014 Jul,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
16771224,Open study on efficacy and safety of levofloxacin in treatment of uncomplicated typhoid fever.,"The main objective of this study was to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of levofloxacin in an open setting for typhoid fever cases. Patients with clinical signs and symptoms of typhoid fever without previous antimicrobial treatment admitted to affiliated hospitals of the Faculty of Medicine, University Indonesia were included in this study. Adults, 18 years or above, were screened for any serious underlying conditions, pregnancy or possible complications of typhoid fever before final enrollment. Fifty-three subjects were screened, 48 were enrolled. The final diagnosis of enteric fever was made by positive blood culture, polymerase chain reaction or serology, was obtained in 31 cases, in whom one had a concomitant sinus infection and had to be excluded. Thirty patients (11 males, 19 females) aged between 18-58 years (mean 31.7 years) with a history of fever between 1 and 10 days (mean 6.1 days) showed excellent clinical response, becoming afebrile at an average of 2.43 days (range 1-5 days). Adverse effects noted were nausea in 4 patients, vomiting in one and meteorism in another one, which were all difficult to distinguish from the enteric infection. A pruritic rash occurring in two patients may be related to levofloxacin, and insomnia in another patient may be related. Microbiological clearance was obtained both immediately after treatment and at one month. No carrier states were detected in the cases positive for Salmonella typhi or paratyphi. None of the treated typhoid fever cases experienced a clinical relapse. In this open study of levofloxacin 500 mg/day for one week in treatment of uncomplicated typhoid fever, a 100% clinical efficacy was obtained in 30 patients with minimal adverse reactions warranting more intensive studies for this new indication of an old but well known disease in the developing world.","Nelwan RH, Chen K, Nafrialdi, Paramita D",Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health,2006 Jan,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
21223462,Cost of illness due to typhoid fever in five Asian countries.,"OBJECTIVE: To generate community-based estimates of the public (paid by the government) and private (paid by households) costs of blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever in Hechi, China; North Jakarta, Indonesia; Kolkata, India; Karachi, Pakistan and Hue, Vietnam. METHODS: To measure out-of-pocket costs of illness and lost earnings, families with culture-proven cases were surveyed 7, 14 and 90 days after onset of illness. Public costs of treatment were measured at local health facilities using a micro costing (bottom-up) method. RESULTS: The costs of hospitalized cases ranged from USD 129 in Kolkata to USD 432 in North Jakarta (hospitalization rates varied from 2% in Kolkata to 40% in Hechi) and the costs of non-hospitalized cases ranged from USD 13 in Kolkata to USD 67 in Hechi. Where costs were highest (Hechi, North Jakarta and Karachi), the bulk of the costs of hospitalized cases was borne by families, comprising up to 15% of annual household income. CONCLUSION: Although these estimates may understate true costs due to the fact that higher quality treatment may have been provided earlier-than-usual, this multi-country community-based study contributes to evidence on the public and private costs of typhoid fever in developing countries. These cost estimates were used in a cost-effectiveness analysis of typhoid vaccines and will help policymakers respond to World Health Organization's updated typhoid fever immunization recommendations.","Poulos C, Riewpaiboon A, Stewart JF, Clemens J, Guh S, Agtini M, Anh DD, Baiqing D, Bhutta Z, Sur D, Whittington D",Trop Med Int Health,2011 Mar,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
9815456,Risk Factors for Typhoid Fever in Travelers.,"Background: The incidence of typhoid fever in the developing world remains high and has been estimated at 540 cases per 100,000 of the population per year. International travelers to such areas are at risk of infection, especially if they travel under low hygienic standards. Methods: In order to identify the risk factors leading to infection in travelers and expatriates, travel histories, anamnestic and clinical features of 31 patients with typhoid fever, who presented to a German travel clinic, were investigated. Results: Compared to the total patient population of the outpatient clinic during the period of investigation (n = 17,029 patients), patients who presented with typhoid fever were older (39 years versus 31 years, p <.001) and traveled longer (58 days versus 19 days, p <.001). While only 19.2% of the total patient population had traveled to the Indian subcontinent prior to referral, 35.4% of the patients with typhoid fever had acquired the infection there (p <.001). Similar results were obtained for South East Asia and Indonesia: twenty percent of the total patient population traveled there in contrast with 32.2% of patients with typhoid fever (p <.001). Latin America was visited by 16.3% of all patients, but only 6.4% of patients with typhoid (p <.001).","Jelinek T, Nothdurft HD, von Sonnenburg F, Loscher T",J Travel Med,1996 Dec 1,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia

It has fatal complications and measures must be taken to reduce the incidence of typhoid. Vaccinations are a key factor in prevention. This is a phase II randomized observer-blind clinical trial on a novel Vi-DT conjugate vaccine on 200 subjects 12 to 40 years of age. METHODS: Subjects were screened for eligibility after which a blood sample was taken and one dose of vaccine was administered. Investigational vaccine used was Vi-DT and control was Vi-PS. Twenty-eight days after vaccination, subjects visited for providing blood sample to assess immunogenicity and were asked about local and systemic adverse reactions that occurred in the first 28 days. RESULTS: Subjects had minor adverse reactions. Pain was the most common local reaction. Muscle pain was the most common systemic reaction. There were no serious adverse events up to 28 days post vaccination. Seroconversion rates were 100% in the Vi-DT group and 95.96% in the Vi-PS group. Post vaccination GMTs were increased in both groups but it was significantly higher in the Vi-DT group (p < 0.001).

MDR strain detection is needed by using a simple PCR technique that only uses a pair of primers. This is conducted considering the detection of Salmonella Typhi strains that have been carried out so far are only using antimicrobial sensitivity tests to determine microbial resistance phenotypically and to determine genotypically using complex molecular techniques. We aimed to analyse the existence of Salmonella Typhi MDR H58 in patients with typhoid fever in Makassar, Indonesia. A total of 367 blood samples of typhoid fever patients were collected from April 2018 until April 2019. The blood sample was cultured, then confirmed via simple PCR. All of the confirmed samples were tested for susceptibility against antibiotics and molecularly analysed for MDR H58 existence using a simple PCR technique. We found 7% (27/367) of the samples to be positive by both blood culture and PCR. All 27 isolates were found to be sensitive to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. The lowest drug sensitivities were to amoxicillin, at one (3.7%) of 27 isolates, and ampicillin, at 13 (48.1%) of 27 isolates. Salmonella Typhi H58 PCR results showed that one (3.7%) of 27 isolates carried a positive fragment of 993 bp that led to the H58 strain, since the deletion flanks this fragment. The isolate was also found to be resistant to amoxicillin and fluoroquinolone according to a sensitivity test. Further molecular analysis needs to be conducted to examine the single isolate that carried the 933 bp fragment.","Jamilah J, Hatta M, Natzir R, Umar F, Sjahril R, Agus R, Junita AR, Dwiyanti R, Primaguna MR, Sabir M",New Microbes New Infect,2020 Nov,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia

This study sought to characterize the epidemiology of human rickettsioses amongst patients hospitalized with fever at 8 tertiary hospitals in Indonesia. METHODS: Acute and convalescent blood from 975 hospitalized non-dengue patients was tested for Rickettsia IgM and IgG by ELISA. Specimens from cases with seroconversion or increasing IgM and/or IgG titers were tested for Rickettsia IgM and IgG by IFA and Rickettsia genomes using primers for Rickettsia (R.) sp, R. typhi, and Orientia tsutsugamushi. Testing was performed retrospectively on stored specimens; results did not inform patient management. RESULTS: R. typhi, R. rickettsii, and O. tsutsugamushi IgG antibodies were identified in 269/872 (30.8%), 36/634 (5.7%), and 19/504 (3.8%) of samples, respectively. For the 103/975 (10.6%) non-dengue patients diagnosed with acute rickettsial infection, presenting symptoms included nausea (72%), headache (69%), vomiting (43%), lethargy (33%), anorexia (32%), arthralgia (30%), myalgia (28%), chills (28%), epigastric pain (28%), and rash (17%). No acute rickettsioses cases were suspected during hospitalization. Discharge diagnoses included typhoid fever (44), dengue fever (20), respiratory infections (7), leptospirosis (6), unknown fever (6), sepsis (5), hepatobiliary infections (3), UTI (3), and others (9). Fatalities occurred in 7 (6.8%) patients, mostly with co-morbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Rickettsial infections are consistently misdiagnosed, often as leptospirosis, dengue, or Salmonella typhi infection.

39055762,"Tackling salmonellosis: A comprehensive exploration of risks factors, impacts, and solutions.","Salmonellosis, caused by Salmonella species, is one of the most common foodborne illnesses worldwide with an estimated 93.8 million cases and about 155,00 fatalities. In both industrialized and developing nations, Salmonellosis has been reported to be one of the most prevalent foodborne zoonoses and is linked with arrays of illness syndromes such as acute and chronic enteritis, and septicaemia. The two major and most common Salmonella species implicated in both warm-blooded and cold-blooded animals are Salmonella bongori and Salmonella enterica. To date, more than 2400 S. enterica serovars which affect both humans and animals have been identified. Salmonella is further classified into serotypes based on three primary antigenic determinants: somatic (O), flagella (H), and capsular (K). The capacity of nearly all Salmonella species to infect, multiply, and survive in human host cells with the aid of their pathogenic and virulence arsenals makes them deadly and important public health pathogens. Primarily, food-producing animals such as poultry, swine, cattle, and their products have been identified as important sources of salmonellosis. Additionally, raw fruits and vegetables are among other food types that have been linked to the spread of Salmonella spp. Based on the clinical manifestation of human salmonellosis, Salmonella strains can be categorized as either non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) and typhoidal Salmonella. The detection of aseptically collected Salmonella in necropsies, environmental samples, feedstuffs, rectal swabs, and food products serves as the basis for diagnosis. In developing nations, typhoid fever due to Salmonella Typhi typically results in the death of 5%-30% of those affected. The World Health Organization (WHO) calculated that there are between 16 and 17 million typhoid cases worldwide each year, with scaring 600,000 deaths as a result. The contagiousness of a Salmonella outbreak depends on the bacterial strain, serovar, growth environment, and host susceptibility. Risk factors for Salmonella infection include a variety of foods; for example, contaminated chicken, beef, and pork. Globally, there is a growing incidence and emergence of life-threatening clinical cases, especially due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella spp, including strains exhibiting resistance to important antimicrobials such as beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and third-generation cephalosporins. In extreme cases, especially in situations involving very difficult-to-treat strains, death usually results. The severity of the infections resulting from Salmonella pathogens is dependent on the serovar type, host susceptibility, the type of bacterial strains, and growth environment. This review therefore aims to detail the nomenclature, etiology, history, pathogenesis, reservoir, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, epidemiology, transmission, risk factors, antimicrobial resistance, public health importance, economic impact, treatment, and control of salmonellosis.","Ayuti SR, Khairullah AR, Al-Arif MA, Lamid M, Warsito SH, Moses IB, Hermawan IP, Silaen OSM, Lokapirnasari WP, Aryaloka S, Ferasyi TR, Hasib A, Delima M",Open Vet J,2024 Jun,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
15780724,"Policymakers' views regarding the introduction of new-generation vaccines against typhoid fever, shigellosis and cholera in Asia.","Face-to-face interviews and meetings with more than 160 policymakers and other influential professionals in seven large Asian countries (Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Thailand and Vietnam) were conducted to survey opinions regarding the need for, and potential uses of new-generation vaccines against cholera, typhoid fever and shigellosis. Despite several barriers to their uptake--notably uncertainty of the burden of enteric diseases; preference for water, sanitation and other environmental improvements over vaccination for disease control; and high prices of the current vaccines relative to basic EPI vaccines, and their moderate protection levels--considerable interest was found in the targeted use of Vi typhoid vaccine in most countries, followed by (future) Shigella and oral cholera vaccines. The introduction of these vaccines in Asia could be greatly facilitated by country-specific evidence of disease burden, local or regional vaccine production, field studies demonstrating their safety and efficacy in local populations, evidence of potential economic savings from vaccination, and effective dissemination of research results to all those who make or influence immunization policy.","DeRoeck D, Clemens JD, Nyamete A, Mahoney RT",Vaccine,2005 Apr 15,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
6981171,Response of typhoid fever caused by chloramphenicol-susceptible and chloramphenicol-resistant strains of Salmonella typhi to treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.,"Chloramphenicol remains the drug of choice for the treatment of typhoid fever in most areas despite the risks of relapses and toxicity. In a comparison of the efficacy of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) and chloramphenicol against typhoid fever, 60 patients in Indonesia were randomly assigned to receive either TMP-SMZ (320 mg of TMP and 1,600 mg of SMZ daily) or chloramphenicol (2 g daily) for 14 days. TMP-SMZ was significantly more effective in sterilizing the blood, but the two drugs were equally effective with regard to relapse rate, frequency of prolonged fever, and mortality. Use of TMP-SMZ in Vietnam for the treatment of typhoid fever caused by chloramphenicol-resistant Salmonella typhi showed that TMP-SMZ is as effective as ampicillin. Likewise, a review of other published reports suggests that TMP-SMZ has an overall record in the treatment of typhoid fever that is equal to or better than the records of other available drugs. TMP-SMZ has emerged as a satisfactory alternative to chloramphenicol for the treatment of typhoid fever and should be especially useful in areas where chloramphenicol-resistant S. typhi has been isolated.","Butler T, Rumans L, Arnold K",Rev Infect Dis,1982 Mar-Apr,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
17673269,Laboratory evaluation of a simple and rapid latex agglutination assay for the serodiagnosis of typhoid fever.,"A latex agglutination assay for the serodiagnosis of typhoid fever was evaluated on samples collected from patients with clinical suspicion of typhoid fever in South Sulawesi, Indonesia, where the disease is endemic. The latex assay is very easy to use, gives a rapid result and may be used as a point-of-care diagnostic test. For acute phase samples collected on average 6 days after the onset of illness, the sensitivity is 42.5% for culture-confirmed patients with typhoid fever and the specificity is 96.9%. The sensitivity improved with the duration of illness from 30.8% for samples collected during the first 4-5 days of illness to 45.5% for samples collected between days 7 and 9, and to 84.6% for the samples collected more than 9 days after the onset of illness. Testing of follow-up samples may further improve sensitivity by demonstrating seroconversion.","Abdoel TH, Pastoor R, Smits HL, Hatta M",Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,2007 Oct,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
39312288,Prolonged Care for Presumed Typhoid Encephalitis in Indonesia.,"Despite advancements in military medical treatment and evacuation, soldiers in austere environments remain vulnerable to disease and non-battle injury and may face prolonged evacuation before receiving definitive care. In particular, arranging care for a soldier presenting with a conditions that has a wide differential diagnosis, such as acute altered mental status (AMS), can be especially challenging. We highlight the case of an otherwise young, healthy U.S. Soldier serving in Indonesia, who presented with acute AMS concerning for undifferentiated infection. Subsequent workup at the receiving hospital following evacuation revealed Salmonella enterica infection, more commonly known as typhoid. However, even with clinical findings of typhoid encephalitis and initiation of empiric treatment, medical care proved challenging in the resource-limited local facilities, despite multiple escalations of care. Ultimately, the patient was evacuated to a tertiary facility in Singapore, where his condition improved, and 4 days after initial presentation the patient had no definitive findings of infections on lumbar puncture. This case not only highlights the threat of typhoid and other infectious diseases in modern operations but also the challenges of suboptimal medical care in both the prehospital and hospital settings when utilizing host nation facilities.","Berrios I, Carius BM, Vaughn NA, Dobbe L",J Spec Oper Med,2024 Oct 2,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
30300755,"Microbiological features of indigenous typhoid cases in Taiwan and relatedness to imported cases, 2001-2014: A cross-sectional analysis.","BACKGROUND: Typhoid fever was rare in Taiwan but approximately two-thirds of the cases were indigenous. The transmission source of the indigenous cases and the relatedness to the imported cases remained unknown. METHODS: Patients with any site culture positive for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi were identified in a teaching hospital during 2001-2014. The isolates were determined for antibiotic susceptibilities, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) types and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) types. RESULTS: A total of 64 typhoid episodes were identified in 63 patients. Seventeen episodes (26.6%) were imported and a majority (10, 58.8%) of them were from Indonesia. The clinical manifestations, outcomes of patients and antibiograms of isolates were similar between indigenous and imported cases. 63.3% of the isolates were ciprofloxacin-resistant. The distributions of PFGE and SNP types did not differ significantly between indigenous and imported isolates, either (P = 0.191 and 0.124, respectively). Identical PFGE pattern could be identified in indigenous isolates appearing at certain time frames, indicating outbreaks due to local transmission of certain Typhi strains. CONCLUSIONS: The imported cases of typhoid fever from Southeast Asia were the major sources of indigenous S. Typhi infections in Taiwan. Small-scale outbreaks occurred due to local transmission of the strains after their importation.","Chien SC, Iap TH, Chiu YR, Shie SS, Chen CJ",Travel Med Infect Dis,2019 Jan-Feb,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
18402191,Adults' perceived prevalence of enteric fever predicts laboratory-validated incidence of typhoid fever in children.,"This study was undertaken to develop a model to predict the incidence of typhoid in children based on adults' perception of prevalence of enteric fever in the wider community. Typhoid cases among children, aged 5-15 years, from epidemic regions in five Asian countries were confirmed with a positive Salmonella Typhi culture of the blood sample. Estimates of the prevalence of enteric fever were obtained from random samples of adults in the same study sites. Regression models were used for establishing the prediction equation. The percentages of enteric fever reported by adults and cases of typhoid incidence per 100,000, detected through blood culture were 4.7 and 24.18 for Viet Nam, 3.8 and 29.20 for China, 26.3 and 180.33 for Indonesia, 66.0 and 454.15 for India, and 52.7 and 407.18 for Pakistan respectively. An established prediction equation was: incidence of typhoid (1/100,000= -2.6946 + 7.2296 x reported prevalence of enteric fever (%) (F=31.7, p<0.01; R2=0.992). Using adults' perception of prevalence of disease as the basis for estimating its incidence in children provides a cost-effective behavioural epidemiologic method to facilitate prevention and control of the disease.","Chen X, Stanton B, Pach A, Nyamete A, Ochiai RL, Kaljee L, Dong B, Sur D, Bhattacharya SK, Santoso SS, Agtini M, Memon Z, Bhutta Z, Do CG, von Seidlein L, Clemens J",J Health Popul Nutr,2007 Dec,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
12164298,Simple dipstick assay for the detection of Salmonella typhi-specific IgM antibodies and the evolution of the immune response in patients with typhoid fever.,"Application of a dipstick assay for the detection of Salmonella typhi-specific IgM antibodies on samples collected from S. typhi or S. paratyphi culture-positive patients at the day of admission to the hospital revealed the presence of specific IgM antibodies in 43.5%, 92.9%, and 100% for samples collected 4-6 days, 6-9 days, and > 9 days after the onset of fever, respectively. The mean sensitivity for samples collected an average of 6.6 days after the onset of fever was 65.3%. Culture was positive in 65.9% of the cases with a final clinical diagnosis of typhoid fever. Testing of paired serum samples from culture negative patients with a final clinical diagnosis of typhoid fever resulted in staining of the dipstick in 4.3% of the samples collected at the day of admission to the hospital and in 76.6% of the samples collected one week later, thereby provided strong supporting evidence of typhoid fever by demonstrating seroconversion in a large proportion of the patients. The dipstick assay may thus also be useful for the serodiagnosis of culture-negative patients with clinical signs and symptoms consistent with typhoid fever. The advantages of the dipstick assay are that the result can be obtained on the same day allowing a prompt treatment, that only a small volume of serum is needed, and that no special laboratory equipment is needed to perform the assay. The stability of the reagents of the dipstick and the simplicity of the assay allows its use in places that lack laboratory facilities.","Hatta M, Goris MG, Heerkens E, Gooskens J, Smits HL",Am J Trop Med Hyg,2002 Apr,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
33059607,A novel Vi-diphtheria toxoid typhoid conjugate vaccine is safe and can induce immunogenicity in healthy Indonesian children 2-11 years: a phase II preliminary report.,"BACKGROUND: Typhoid fever caused by Salmonella enteric serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) is a common cause of morbidity in the world. In 2017, 14.3 million cases of Typhoid and paratyphoid fever occurred globally. School age children between 3 to 19 years old are the most affected. Poor sanitation and multi drug resistance have increased the need for vaccines to reduce the global burden of disease. Based on previous trials, typhoid conjugate vaccines have longer- lasting protection, higher efficacy, require fewer doses and are suitable from infancy that allows them to be incorporated into the routine immunization program. Our previous phase I trial proved that a novel Vi-DT typhoid conjugate vaccine is safe and immunogenic in subjects 2-5 and 18-40 years. Our phase II trial consisted of subjects 6 months to 40 years. Our previously published paper on subjects 6 to < 24 months proved that this vaccine is safe and immunogenic for this age group. Therefore, with this paper we aimed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity in children 2-11 years. METHODS: A randomized, observer-blind, superiority design of Vi-DT Typhoid conjugate vaccine compared to Vi-polysaccharide vaccine (Vi-PS) phase II study was conducted from October 2018 to December 2018 where 200 subjects aged 2-11 years were recruited. A blood sample prior to vaccination was taken, followed by administration of a single dose of either test vaccine (Vi-DT) or control vaccine (Vi-PS) and then a second blood sample was collected 28 days post vaccination. Adverse reactions were assessed and antibody increment was evaluated at 28 days post vaccination through collected serum sample. RESULTS: Pain was the most common local reaction. Fever and muscle pain were the most common systemic reactions. Both Vi-DT and Vi-PS groups had roughly the same number of adverse reactions. At 28 days post vaccination, 100% of subjects in the Vi-DT group and 93% of subjects in the Vi-PS group produced antibody increment >/=4 times. The Vi-DT group produced a higher GMT as compared to Vi-PS. CONCLUSION: Vi-DT vaccine is safe and immunogenic in children 2-11 years old.

28484494,"Antimicrobial Resistance of Salmonella enterica Serovars Typhi and Paratyphi Isolates from a General Hospital in Karawaci, Tangerang, Indonesia: A Five-Year Review.","Typhoid and paratyphoid fever known as enteric fever pose important global public health problem, with 21.6 million cases and approximately 250,000 deaths annually. It is a prevalent disease in Indonesia, but data on the antimicrobial resistance pattern is limited. This study aim was to provide data on the antimicrobial resistance pattern of S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi bloodstream isolates in a general hospital in Karawaci, Tangerang, Banten, Indonesia, during the period of January 2011 to December 2015. Susceptibility against antimicrobials was detected according to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Out of a total of 168 isolates 55.4% were S. Typhi and 44.6% S. Paratyphi A. Most of the isolates, 92.9%, were from children aged 6-18 years and adult population. There was low resistance of S. Typhi against ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin, similar to previous studies in Indonesia. In the 2011-2015 period, resistance rates against most antimicrobials and MDR rate of S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi were low, emphasizing that there is a distinct epidemiological dynamic of the enteric fever in Indonesia.","Hardjo Lugito NP, Cucunawangsih",Int J Microbiol,2017,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
40163994,"Environmental surveillance for Salmonella Typhi to detect the typhoid burden in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: In low and middle-income countries (LMICs), understanding the burden of typhoid disease has been challenging as clinical surveillance based on blood culture data alone often poorly represents the community burden. Underreported cases, unclear case definitions, the presence of a chronic carrier state and emerging antimicrobial resistance necessitate alternative approaches to assess disease prevalence and target public health interventions, such as vaccine introduction. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of wastewater and environmental surveillance (WES) in measuring the prevalence of typhoid infection in Indonesia. METHODS: Between October 11, 2022, and August 31, 2023, WES was conducted in 18 locations across 3 districts in Yogyakarta province, Indonesia. Samples were collected fortnightly from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), manholes, a river, and public spaces, using grab and passive sampling methods. Salmonella Typhi (S. Typhi) detection was conducted using quantitative PCR for S. Typhi genes (ttr, tviB, and staG - all positive). RESULTS: Of the 406 samples collected, 13 % (51/406) tested positive for S. Typhi, with monthly positivity rates ranging from 2 % (1/51) in March 2023 to 47 % (16/34) in October 2022. Mean concentrations (in log10) in ttr, tviB, and staG in grab samples were 0.67 (SD +/- 0.99), 0.23 (SD +/- 1.14), and -0.11 (SD +/- 1.05). The highest detection rates were observed in samples from the river compared to central WWTPs (OR 12.68; 95 % CI 2.03-79.20, P = 0.007). No correlation was observed between rainfall and S. Typhi gene detection (P > 0.05 for all genes). CONCLUSION: WES is feasible in Indonesia and can be used to monitor typhoid disease burden in an endemic region. High positivity rates from the river and septic tanks in traditional markets support a broad approach to sampling in LMICs where formal wastewater management systems may not accurately represent community disease prevalence due to its low population coverage. WES can be a valuable tool to inform public health responses, including vaccine introduction.","Oktaria V, Murni IK, Handley A, Donato CM, Nuryastuti T, Supriyati E, McCarthy DT, Watts E, Dinari R, Sari HM, Thobari JA, Laksono IS, Bines JE",Int J Hyg Environ Health,2025 May,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
31226110,"The inappropriate use of antibiotics in hospitalized dengue virus-infected children with presumed concurrent bacterial infection in teaching and private hospitals in Bandung, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: Dengue virus infection (DVI) among children is a leading cause of hospitalization in endemic areas. Hospitalized patients are at risk of receiving unnecessary antibiotics. METHODS: A retrospective medical review analysis study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence, indication, and choice of antibiotics given to hospitalized patients less than 15 years of age with DVI in two different hospital settings (teaching and private hospitals) in the Municipality of Bandung. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data were obtained using a pre-tested standardized questionnaire from patients' medical records admitted from January 1 to December 31, 2015. RESULTS: There were 537 (17.5%) out of 3078 cases who received antibiotics. Among 176 cases admitted to the teaching hospitals, presumed bacterial upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) and typhoid fever were found in 1 (0.6%) case and 6 (0.3%) cases. In private hospitals among 2902 cases, presumed bacterial URTI was found in 324 (11.2%) cases, typhoid fever in 188 (6.5%) cases and urinary tract infection (UTI) in 18 (0.6%) cases. The prevalence of URTI and typhoid fever were significantly lower in the teaching hospitals compared to the private hospitals (p<0.0001 and p<0.05 respectively). The diagnosis of URTI in both teaching and private hospitals was merely based on clinical findings. Amoxicillin was given to 1 patient in the teaching hospitals; the 3rd generation of cephalosporins, mostly intravenous, were given in 247 (67%) cases in private hospitals. The diagnosis of typhoid fever in the teaching hospitals was based on culture in 1 (16.7%) and reactive IgM anti-Salmonella in 5 (83.3%) cases while in the private hospitals, they were based on reactive IgM anti-Salmonella in 13 (6.5%) cases, single Widal test in 61 (32.5%), and without laboratory confirmation in 114 (60.6%) cases. Most of the cases in both hospital settings were treated mostly with 3rd generation cephalosporin. The diagnosis of UTI was based on positive leucocyte esterase and nitrite in urine dipstick test in 7 (38.9%) and leucocyturia alone in 11 (61.1%) cases and was treated with 3rd generation in 15 (83.3%) cases, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol and clarithromycin, each in 1 (5.6%) case. CONCLUSION: The use of antibiotics in private hospitals was inappropriate in most cases while the use of antibiotics in the teaching hospital was more accountable. This study indicated that interventions, such as the implementation of the antibiotics stewardship program, are needed especially in private hospitals to reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics.","Adrizain R, Setiabudi D, Chairulfatah A",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,2019 Jun,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
16078047,Susceptibility to typhoid fever is associated with a polymorphism in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR).,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is the affected protein in cystic fibrosis (CF). The high rate of CF carriers has led to speculation that there must be, similar to the sickle cell haemoglobin advantage in malaria, a selective advantage for heterozygotes. Such a selective advantage may be conferred through reduced attachment of Salmonella typhi to intestinal mucosa, thus providing resistance to typhoid fever. We tested this hypothesis by genotyping patients and controls in a typhoid endemic area in Indonesia for two highly polymorphic markers in CFTR and the most common CF mutation. We found an association between genotypes in CFTR and susceptibility to typhoid fever (OR=2.6). These analyses suggest that the role CFTR plays in vitro in S. typhi infection is also important for infection in the human population.","van de Vosse E, Ali S, de Visser AW, Surjadi C, Widjaja S, Vollaard AM, van Dissel JT",Hum Genet,2005 Oct,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia

The isolates from Bangladesh and Vietnam were genetically closely related but were distant from those from Indonesia and Taiwan. All but a few isolates from Indonesia and Taiwan were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested. The majority of isolates from Bangladesh and Vietnam were multidrug resistant (MDR) and belonged to the widespread haplotype H58 clone. IncHI1 plasmids were detected in all MDR S. Typhi isolates from Vietnam but in only 15% of MDR isolates from Bangladesh. Resistance genes in the majority of MDR S. Typhi isolates from Bangladesh should reside in the chromosome. Among the isolates from Bangladesh, 82% and 40% were resistant to various concentrations of nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin, respectively. Several resistance mechanisms, including alterations in gyrase A, the presence of QnrS, and enhanced efflux pumps, were involved in the reduced susceptibility and resistance to fluoroquinolones. Intensive surveillance is necessary to monitor the spread of chromosome-mediated MDR and fluoroquinolone-resistant S. Typhi emerging in Bangladesh.","Chiou CS, Lauderdale TL, Phung DC, Watanabe H, Kuo JC, Wang PJ, Liu YY, Liang SY, Chen PC",Antimicrob Agents Chemother,2014 Nov,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
19741289,Enteric fever in endemic areas of Indonesia: an increasing problem of resistance.,"Reported levels of antibiotic resistance in Salmonella Typhi from South Sulawesi, Indonesia were very low (< 1%) before 2001 and chloramphenicol remained the treatment of choice. Since 2001 however resistance has been rising and in 2007 6.8% of isolates were resistant to all three first line drugs: Ampicillin, chloramphenicol and co-trimoxazole. Ciprofloxacin resistance is currently at 3.90 %. At the same time there has been an increase in the number of reported cases. This may be because of improved diagnostics or it may be a genuine outbreak of drug resistant S. Typhi. In conclusion drug resistant typhoid fever will become a serious problem in Indonesia in the future, requiring the use of expensive drugs for the treatment of typhoid. A concerted effort is needed by the medical services to implement reliable diagnosis so that treatment or vaccination can be used to control the spread of drug resistant typhoid fever.","Hatta M, Ratnawati",J Infect Dev Ctries,2008 Aug 30,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
36253712,"Hotspots sequences of gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE genes encoded for fluoroquinolones resistance from local Salmonella Typhi strains in Jakarta.","BACKGROUND: Infection of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhi is the primary etiology of typhoid fever globally and is common in many developing countries, especially those with dense populations and poor environmental sanitation. Antibiotic fluoroquinolones were used for the treatment in the 1980s due to the resistance to the first-line antibiotics. However, many cases of treatment failure of fluoroquinolones in typhoidal patients have been reported from numerous countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and America. Mutations in quinolone resistance determining regions (QRDR) genes, gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE, are found in fluoroquinolone-resistant Salmonella Typhi. Contrast reports came from the S. Typhi isolates in Indonesia, mainly Jakarta and the surroundings, obtained from patients with typhoid fever, with good sensitivity to the fluoroquinolones, i.e., nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and levofloxacin. The present study, therefore, aimed to identify the hotspot sequences of gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE genes of the local S. Typhi strains based on their susceptibility to fluoroquinolones from patients with typhoid fever in Jakarta and its satellite cities. RESULTS: A total of 28 isolates were identified as S. Typhi. All isolates were susceptible to nalidixic acid, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. Twenty-seven isolates (96.4%) were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, with one isolate (3.6%) being intermediate. The hotspot sequences of gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE genes from all isolates were identical to the fluoroquinolone-sensitive reference sequence Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhi Ty2 (NCBI GenBank AE014613.1), including the isolate with intermediate susceptibility. The mutation was not found, and amino acid deduced from all hotspots in susceptible and intermediate isolates showed no replacement in all reported codons. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the local S. Typhi strains from Jakarta and surroundings were susceptible to fluoroquinolones (nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin), and the hotspot sequences of the gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE genes were all identical to the reference sequence. Thus, the hotspot sequences of the gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE genes seemingly were conserved in Jakarta's local S. Typhi strains and could be considered wild type. The phenotypic susceptibility was consistent with the genotypic characteristic without non-synonymous mutations associated with drug resistance.","Nathania I, Nainggolan IM, Yasmon A, Nusatia ACM, Tjoa E, Gunardi WD, Moehario LH",BMC Microbiol,2022 Oct 18,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
27523510,Enteric Fever in a Tertiary Paediatric Hospital: A Retrospective Six-Year Review.,"INTRODUCTION: Enteric fever is a multisystemic infection which largely affects children. This study aimed to analyse the epidemiology, clinical presentation, treatment and outcome of paediatric enteric fever in Singapore. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of children diagnosed with enteric fever in a tertiary paediatric hospital in Singapore was conducted from January 2006 to January 2012. Patients with positive blood cultures for Salmonella typhi or paratyphi were identified from the microbiology laboratory information system. Data was extracted from their case records. RESULTS: Of 50 enteric fever cases, 86% were due to Salmonella typhi, with 16.3% being multidrug resistant (MDR) strains. Sixty-two percent of S. typhi isolates were of decreased ciprofloxacin susceptibility (DCS). Five cases were both MDR and DCS. The remaining 14% were Salmonella paratyphi A. There were only 3 indigenous cases. Ninety-four percent had travelled to typhoid-endemic countries, 70.2% to the Indian subcontinent and the rest to Indonesia and Malaysia. All patients infected with MDR strains had travelled to the Indian subcontinent. Anaemia was a significant finding in children with typhoid, as compared to paratyphoid fever (P = 0.04). Although all children were previously well, 14% suffered severe complications including shock, pericardial effusion and enterocolitis. None had typhoid vaccination prior to their travel to developing countries. CONCLUSION: Enteric fever is largely an imported disease in Singapore and has contributed to significant morbidity in children. The use of typhoid vaccine, as well as education on food and water hygiene to children travelling to developing countries, needs to be emphasised.","Ahmad Hatib NA, Chong CY, Thoon KC, Tee NW, Krishnamoorthy SS, Tan NW",Ann Acad Med Singap,2016 Jul,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia

32004693,One-month follow up of a randomized clinical trial-phase II study in 6 to <24 months old Indonesian subjects: Safety and immunogenicity of Vi-DT Typhoid Conjugate Vaccine.,"INTRODUCTION: World Health Organization estimates the annual global incidence of typhoid fever at 11-21 million cases and approximately 128 000 to 161 000 deaths. The currently used Vi-polysaccharides (Vi-PS) vaccines have been proven to be safe and efficacious in children 2 years and above. However, poor immunogenicity of Vi-PS was observed in children below 2 years of age. This Phase II study is the continuation of the previously published Phase I study that aims to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a novel Vi-DT Typhoid Conjugate Vaccine (Bio Farma) in subjects 6 to <24 months. METHODS: An interventional, blinded, comparative, randomized phase II study was conducted from July 2018 until January 2019. There were 200 healthy subjects divided into two groups: trial and control groups. Inactivated poliovirus vaccine was given to control group. Immediate and delayed local and systemic reactions up to 28 days post vaccination were recorded. Antibody titers were measured prior to vaccination (V1) and 28 days post vaccination (V2). RESULT: The study showed that the seroconversion of Vi-DT vaccine 98.99%. One dose of Vi-DT vaccine induced higher geometric mean titers (GMT) in all subjects compared to that of baseline. Pain was the most common immediate and delayed local reaction. Immediate and delayed systemic reactions that mostly occurred was fever. There were no serious adverse events reported within 28 days post vaccination. CONCLUSION: The novel typhoid Vi-DT conjugate vaccine is safe and immunogenic in children 6 to <24 months.

8560588,Culture of Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi from blood and bone marrow in suspected typhoid fever.,"We studied the yield of blood and bone marrow (BM) cultures in 145 patients clinically suspected of typhoid fever (TF) in Indonesia. The objectives were to compare the positivity of blood culture using 3 ml versus 10 ml of blood and to examine in how far specific antibiotic treatment for TF interfered with the positivity of BM culture. Blood for culture was collected before antibiotic treatment was initiated in hospital and BM 1 to 10 days after the start of treatment. Cultures were performed with Oxgall subcultured on SS agar. Seventy-nine per cent of patients was treated for 14 days or more with oral chloramphenicol, 18% with chloramphenicol followed by ampicillin or cotrimoxazol and 3% with other antibiotics. Cultures were positive for Salmonella typhi or S-paratyphi A in 57 of the 145 patients (39.3%) when 3 ml of blood was cultured and in 58 (40%) when 10 ml of blood was cultured. BM culture was positive despite antibiotic treatment in 70 patients (48.2%); this positivity was significantly greater than that of blood cultures (p < 0.05). When we considered the positivity of BM culture in relation to the number of days on antibiotics in hospital, the yield of BM culture remained apparently unchanged during the first 5 days of treatment. This may be the consequence of slow elimination of S.typhi or S.paratyphi by the antibiotics used and could be responsible for relapses.","Gasem MH, Dolmans WM, Isbandrio BB, Wahyono H, Keuter M, Djokomoeljanto R",Trop Geogr Med,1995,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
16500779,Acute acalculous cholecystitis: A rare presentation of typhoid fever in adults.,"Adult typhoidal acute acalculous cholecystitis is rare with only 2 cases having been reported in the English literature. We present the case of a previously healthy 36-y-old female who suffered fever, chills, epigastralgia and progressive jaundice for 3 d, with acute acalculous cholecystitis subsequently diagnosed. In addition to antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone, open cholecystectomy was performed. However, bile and blood culture both showed Salmonella typhi growth unexpectedly, and ileocolitis was revealed by colonoscopy. Careful tracing of the history of the patient recalled a history of travel to Indonesia. In adults without common risk factors for acalculous cholecystitis, a detailed history including travel to endemic areas and high index of suspicion for typhoidal acute acalculous cholecystitis are important, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy for covering Salmonella typhi should be considered.","Lai CH, Huang CK, Chin C, Lin HH, Chi CY, Chen HP",Scand J Infect Dis,2006,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
10689234,Typhoid fever in group travelers: opportunity for studying vaccine efficacy.,"BACKGROUND: Typhoid fever (TF) is a rare disease among travelers to endemic areas, and little is known about its travel-related epidemiology. In addition, efficacy data on TF vaccines in travelers is scanty. During 3 months of 1994/95, six cases of TF were reported in The Netherlands among participants of four package tours to Indonesia provided by the same operator. The present study was designed to describe the epidemiology of TF in these groups, and to assess whether travel groups can be used for studying the efficacy of TF vaccines in travelers. METHOD: Questionnaire-based historical cohort study of participants of 4 groups that stayed in the same hotels along their tours (n=156). TF was defined as blood culture-confirmed Salmonella typhi infection. Submitted isolates were typed by antigen and phage typing. Immunization status was considered documented if ascertained by written records. RESULTS: Among 110 participants (71%), six cases of TF were identified (group specific attack rate AR 5.4%), three of which were from one travel group (AR 12.0%). There were no significant differences by age or sex. Three submitted S. typhi isolates showed three different types, two of which were in the same group. Eighty-three percent of respondents reported documented TF vaccination in the preceding 3 years. All cases occurred in recipients of the oral Ty21a vaccine (AR 10.2%, 95% CI 3.8-20.8%), but differences with nonvaccinees and recipients of the heat-inactivated whole cell or Vi-antigen polysaccharide vaccines were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Although TF is rare in travelers, infections with different strains of S. typhi can occur in one travel group. Travel groups offer an opportunity for retrospective assessment of vaccine efficacy, provided that equal chance of exposure is largely guaranteed; case ascertainment is maximally specific and similar in the vaccine groups; vaccine status is ascertained accurately; and prior immunity by previous exposures to and use of antibiotics effective against the infection are excluded from, or controlled for in, the analysis.","Cobelens FG, Kooij S, Warris-Versteegen A, Visser LG",J Travel Med,2000 Jan,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
26333341,New parameters available on Sysmex XE-5000 hematology analyzers contribute to differentiating dengue from leptospirosis and enteric fever.,"INTRODUCTION: Distinguishing dengue virus infection from other febrile thrombocytopenic illnesses such as leptospirosis or enteric fever is important but difficult, due to the unavailability of reliable diagnostic tests. Sysmex XE-5000 hematology analyzers use fluorescence flow cytometry to quantitate new parameters including cells in the atypical lymphocyte area (AL), high-fluorescent lymphocyte counts (HFLC), immature granulocytes (IG), and immature platelets (IPF). This study aimed to investigate whether these parameters can help to discriminate between the diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We compared hematocytometry performed by a Sysmex XE-5000 analyzer in Indonesian adults with dengue (n = 93), leptospirosis (n = 11), and enteric fever (n = 6) infection, and in healthy controls (n = 28). RESULTS: Receiver operating characteristic curves comparing dengue and leptospirosis showed that dengue was characterized by increased %AL (AUC 0.87; 95% CI 0.70-1.03), %HFLC (AUC 0.89; 95% CI 0.78-0.99), and %IPF (AUC 0.81; 95% CI 0.65-0.97), while patients with leptospirosis had increased %IG (AUC 0.86; 95% CI 0.71-1.02). Low %AL, %HFLC, and %IG supported a diagnosis of enteric fever. CONCLUSIONS: The detection of AL, HFLC, IG, and IPF by Sysmex XE-5000 hematology analyzers can help to differentiate between common causes of febrile illnesses with thrombocytopenia in dengue endemic areas. We recommend further investigating the discriminatory value of these parameters in clinical practice.","Oehadian A, Michels M, de Mast Q, Prihatni D, Puspita M, Hartantri Y, Sinarta S, van der Ven AJ, Alisjahbana B",Int J Lab Hematol,2015 Dec,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
1401030,Diagnosis of typhoid fever by detection of Salmonella typhi antigen in urine.,"A monoclonal antibody specific for group D Salmonella antigen 9 was used in an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting the antigen in urine specimens collected from patients with clinical typhoid fever in Jakarta, Indonesia. The ELISA had a sensitivity of 95% in identifying patients in whom Salmonella typhi was isolated from hemocultures, 73% in patients in whom S. typhi was isolated from stool specimens, and 40% in patients in whom the organism was isolated from bone marrow cultures. Among patients in whom S. typhi was isolated from blood cultures, the ELISA had a sensitivity of 65% when a single urine specimen was examined and 95% when serially collected urine specimens were examined. A dot blot immunoassay performed on a nitrocellulose filter in parallel had a sensitivity of 85%, versus 83% for the plate ELISA in which S. typhi was isolated from blood, bone marrow, and/or stool specimens. Since S. typhi antigen is intermittently excreted in the urine of patients with typhoid fever, serially collected urine from patients with typhoid should be tested for antigen 9.","Chaicumpa W, Ruangkunaporn Y, Burr D, Chongsa-Nguan M, Echeverria P",J Clin Microbiol,1992 Sep,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
17005220,"Introducing Vi polysaccharide typhoid fever vaccine to primary school children in North Jakarta, Indonesia, via an existent school-based vaccination platform.","OBJECTIVES: To report results on coverage, safety and logistics of a large-scale, school-based Vi polysaccharide immunization campaign in North Jakarta. METHODS: Of 443 primary schools in North Jakarta, Indonesia, 18 public schools were randomly selected for this study. Exclusion criteria were fever 37.5 degrees C or higher at the time of vaccination or a known history of hypersensitivity to any vaccine. Adverse events were monitored and recorded for 1 month after immunization. Because this was a pilot programme, resource use was tracked in detail. RESULTS: During the February 2004 vaccination campaign, 4828 students were immunized (91% of the target population); another 394 students (7%) were vaccinated during mop-up programmes. Informed consent was obtained for 98% of the target population. In all, 34 adverse events were reported, corresponding to seven events per 1000 doses injected; none was serious. The manufacturer recommended cold chain was maintained throughout the programme. CONCLUSIONS: This demonstration project in two sub-districts of North Jakarta shows that a large-scale, school-based typhoid fever Vi polysaccharide vaccination campaign is logistically feasible, safe and minimally disruptive to regular school activities, when used in the context of an existing successful immunization platform. The project had high parental acceptance. Nonetheless, policy-relevant questions still need to be answered before implementing a widespread Vi polysaccharide vaccine programme in Indonesia.","Agtini MD, Ochiai RL, Soeharno R, Lee HJ, Sundoro J, Hadinegoro SR, Han OP, Tana L, Halim FX, Ghani L, Delima, Lestari W, Sintawati FX, Kusumawardani N, Malik R, Santoso TS, Nadjib M, Soeroso S, Wangsasaputra F, Ali M, Ivanoff B, Galindo CM, Pang T, Clemens JD, Suwandono A, Acosta CJ",Public Health,2006 Nov,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
30060197,Enteric fever among children: 50 cases in a French tertiary care centre.,"BACKGROUND: Enteric fever in France is primarily travel-associated. Characteristics of paediatric cases are scarce and information from field studies in endemic countries might not be generalizable to non-endemic countries. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we reviewed all cases of typhoid and paratyphoid fever treated in a French paediatric tertiary care centre from 1993 to 2015. RESULTS: Fifty cases of enteric fever due to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (n = 44) and Paratyphi (n = 6) were identified. Sixty-one percent of the children had travelled to Africa and 34% to the Indian subcontinent. Among travel-associated cases, 85% were visiting friends and relatives (VFR). Ninety-six percent had high fever associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. Anaemia (66%), elevated C-reactive protein (80%), transaminitis (87%) and mild hyponatremia (50%) were the main biological findings. Blood cultures were positive in 90% of cases. Twelve strains (24%) were resistant at least to one antibiotic, and all of them had been isolated since 2003, increasing the resistance rate during this last period to 43% (12/28). Ceftriaxone was administered to 71 patients for a median duration of 6 days (interquartile range (IQR): 4-8). The median time to apyrexia after the onset of treatment was 4 days (IQR: 2-5 days). Complications occurred in nine children with five (10%) presenting neurologic disorders. All 50 patients recovered. CONCLUSION: In France, paediatric enteric fever is mainly a travel-associated disease and occurs in patients returning from a prolonged stay in an endemic area. Children VFR are at high risk and should be a priority target group for pre-travel preventive measures. The increase in antibiotic resistance reflects the situation in endemic countries and is a major concern.","Pommelet V, Mariani P, Basmaci R, Tourdjman M, Morin L, Gaschignard J, de Lauzanne A, Lemaitre C, Bonacorsi S, Faye A",J Travel Med,2018 Jan 1,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia

15609776,The role of epidemiology in the introduction of vi polysaccharide typhoid fever vaccines in Asia.,"Despite the availability of at least two licensed typhoid fever vaccines--injectable sub-unit Vi polysaccharide vaccine and live, oral Ty21a vaccine--for the last decade, these vaccines have not been widely introduced in public-health programmes in countries endemic for typhoid fever. The goal of the multidisciplinary DOMI (Diseases of the Most Impoverished) typhoid fever programme is to generate policy-relevant data to support public decision-making regarding the introduction of Vi polysaccharide typhoid fever immunization programmes in China, Viet Nam, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, and Indonesia. Through epidemiological studies, the DOMI Programme is generating these data and is offering a model for the accelerated, rational introduction of new vaccines into health programmes in low-income countries. Practical and specific examples of the role of epidemiology are described in this paper. These examples cover: (a) selection of available typhoid fever vaccines to be introduced in the programme, (b) generation of policy-relevant data, (c) providing the 'backbone' for the implementation of other multidisciplinary projects, and (d) generation of unexpected but useful information relevant for the introduction of vaccines. Epidemiological studies contribute to all stages of development of vaccine evaluation and introduction.","Acosta CJ, Galindo CM, Ochiai RL, Danovaro-Holliday MC, Page AL, Thiem VD, Park JK, Park E, Koo H, Wang XY, Abu-Elyazeed R, Ali M, Albert MJ, Ivanoff B, Pang T, Xu ZY, Clemens JD",J Health Popul Nutr,2004 Sep,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
14513391,Rapid diagnosis of typhoid fever by PCR assay using one pair of primers from flagellin gene of Salmonella typhi.,"Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, we developed a rapid diagnosis method for Salmonella typhi infection in blood specimens from patients with typhoid fever. Primers were designed from the flagellin gene sequence, which would give an amplification product of 367 base pairs. In this study, the specificity of the assay, with no amplification, was seen for the other Salmonella strains with the flagellin gene, and not for non- Salmonella bacteria. For the sensitivity test, the protocol described allowed the detection of two to three copies of the Salmonella typhi genome, as determined by serial dilution of genomic DNA from Salmonella typhi. With the PCR technique, genomic DNA of Salmonella typhi was detected in 46 of 73 blood samples collected from patients with clinically suspected typhoid fever who had fever within 3 days of admission to the General Hospital, Makassar, South Sulawesi, Indonesia, and who had had no prior antibiotic treatment. The PCR results (63% positive cases) were compared with those of blood culture (13.7% positive cases) and the Widal test (35.6% positive cases), using the same samples from each of the 73 patients admitted to the General Hospital in Makassar. The time taken for PCR analysis of each sample was less than 12 h, compared with 3 to 5 days for blood or clot culture. The PCR with one pair of primers can be used as a novel, rapid diagnostic method for typhoid fever, particularly when results of standard culture assays are negative.","Massi MN, Shirakawa T, Gotoh A, Bishnu A, Hatta M, Kawabata M",J Infect Chemother,2003 Sep,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
24073354,The effect of curcumin and cotrimoxazole in salmonella typhimurium infection in vivo.,"Typhoid fever is a disease caused by Salmonella Typhi and commonly treated by an antimicrobial agent such as cotrimoxazole. On the other hand, herbal usage has risen as an adjunctive therapy to treat many diseases. Curcuma (Curcuma domestica) is a commonly used herb which consists of curcumin as its major active compound. Curcumin has been known for its antimicrobial effect, but there is no proof regarding the usage of curcumin and cotrimoxazole together. This research was conducted by using typhoid fever model in mice infected by Salmonella Typhimurium. Each animal was treated with curcumin, cotrimoxazole, or both. Ileum, spleen, and liver of each animal were isolated and cultured. We found that curcumin-cotrimoxazole combination therapy lowered the antimicrobial effectivity of cotrimoxazole in both intraintestinal and extraintestinal organs. We conclude that curcumin-cotrimoxazole combination therapy in typhoid fever has to be reconsidered.","Rahayu SI, Nurdiana N, Santoso S",ISRN Microbiol,2013,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia

Serological evidence of Salmonella infection was found in 130 additional cases without bacteremia. Serological evidence of arbovirus infection (94 cases) was common in children. Malaria was found in 12 adults, most of whom were probably infected outside Jakarta. Little serological evidence was found for rickettsial, leptospiral, Brucella, Toxoplasma gondii or a number of other infections. Clinical signs and symptoms in the febrile patients studed were generally nonspecific, and laboratory results reported were very helpful in establishing more accurate diagnoses.","Anderson KE, Joseph SW, Nasution R, Sunoto, Butler T, Van Peenen PF, Irving GS, Saroso JS, Watten RH",Am J Trop Med Hyg,1976 Jan,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
27281311,Risk Factors of Typhoid Infection in the Indonesian Archipelago.,"BACKGROUND: Knowledge of risk factors and their relative importance in different settings is essential to develop effective health education material for the prevention of typhoid. In this study, we examine the effect of household level and individual behavioural risk factors on the risk of typhoid in three Indonesian islands (Sulawesi, Kalimantan and Papua) in the Eastern Indonesian archipelago encompassing rural, peri-urban and urban areas. METHODS: We enrolled 933 patients above 10 years of age in a health facility-based case-control study between June 2010 and June 2011. Individuals suspected of typhoid were tested using the typhoid IgM lateral flow assay for the serodiagnosis of typhoid fever followed by blood culture testing. Cases and controls were defined post-recruitment: cases were individuals with a culture or serology positive result (n = 449); controls were individuals negative to both serology and culture, with or without a diagnosis other than typhoid (n = 484). Logistic regression was used to examine the effect of household level and individual level behavioural risk factors and we calculated the population attributable fraction (PAF) of removing each risk significant independent behavioural risk factor. RESULTS: Washing hands at critical moments of the day and washing hands with soap were strong independent protective factors for typhoid (OR = 0.38 95% CI 0.25 to 0.58 for each unit increase in hand washing frequency score with values between 0 = Never and 3 = Always; OR = 3.16 95% CI = 2.09 to 4.79 comparing washing hands with soap sometimes/never vs. often). These effects were independent of levels of access to water and sanitation. Up to two thirds of cases could be prevented by compliance to these practices (hand washing PAF = 66.8 95% CI 61.4 to 71.5; use of soap PAF = 61.9 95%CI 56.7 to 66.5). Eating food out in food stalls or restaurant was an important risk factor (OR = 6.9 95%CI 4.41 to 10.8 for every unit increase in frequency score). CONCLUSIONS: Major gains could potentially be achieved in reducing the incidence of typhoid by ensuring adherence to adequate hand-washing practices alone. This confirms that there is a pivotal role for 'software' related interventions to encourage behavior change and create demand for goods and services, alongside development of water and sanitation infrastructure.","Alba S, Bakker MI, Hatta M, Scheelbeek PF, Dwiyanti R, Usman R, Sultan AR, Sabir M, Tandirogang N, Amir M, Yasir Y, Pastoor R, van Beers S, Smits HL",PLoS One,2016,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
22432672,Twenty-six years of enteric fever in Australia: an epidemiological analysis of antibiotic resistance.,"OBJECTIVES: To determine incidence and trends in antibiotic resistance in Australian Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovars Typhi (S. Typhi) and Paratyphi (S. Paratyphi) isolates over the past 26 years. DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of consecutive microbiologically confirmed enteric fever isolates. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: All S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi isolates from patients diagnosed with enteric fever in Australia between 1985 and 2010. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence and variation in antibiotic resistance over time and according to country of origin. RESULTS: We analysed 2551 isolates, which originated from 74 countries or regions, mainly India (33%) and Indonesia (22%). The incidence among Australian residents increased from four to five before 2003 to seven cases per million person-years after 2003. Multidrug resistance (chloramphenicol, ampicillin, trimethoprim) and nalidixic acid resistance emerged rapidly from the early 1990s, with nalidixic acid resistance increasing to 70% in 2009-2010, while multidrug resistance was relatively stable at between 4% and 11%. Nalidixic acid and multidrug resistance rates are highest in isolates from the Indian subcontinent. Some countries in South-East Asia, such as Indonesia, had very low rates of resistance; however, this varied across the region. CONCLUSIONS: Nalidixic acid resistance has become widespread in enteric fever isolates from the Indian subcontinent and some parts of South-East Asia, justifying the use of ceftriaxone or azithromycin rather than ciprofloxacin as first-line treatment. However, resistance in some countries remains rare, potentially allowing treatment to be adjusted according to country of origin.","Commons RJ, McBryde E, Valcanis M, Powling J, Street A, Hogg G",Med J Aust,2012 Mar 19,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia

11414416,The diagnostic value of the ELISA-Ty test for the detection of typhoid fever in children.,"A study on the reliability of an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of typhoid fever, the ELISA-Ty test, was conducted, comprising 44 children suffering from bacteriologically confirmed typhoid fever based on the finding of a positive blood culture for Salmonella typhi, 44 children with fever caused by diseases other than typhoid fever based on the finding of negative culture of blood, urine and stool for S. typhi, and 120 healthy children as controls. This ELISA-Ty test measures the concentration of IgM and of IgG against S. typhi in serum. This test is an indirect ELISA test, based on a method that makes use of a mixture of OMPs (outer membrane proteins) in equal proportion serving as antigen, obtained from different strains of S. typhi which are prevalent locally, peroxidase goat antihuman IgG or IgM (Sigma) as conjugate and orthophenylenediamine (Sigma) as chromogen of the substrate. The result of the test was obtained through the assessment of the end product, using a micro ELISA reader (Behring) at wave length of 490 nm. The data revealed that the mean absorbent values found in children with typhoid fever, for IgM and IgG, were significantly higher (p < 0.05) when compared to those in children with non-typhoid fever as well as to those found in children of the control group. The results of this study confirm that the ELISA-Ty test has a high reliability for the detection of typhoid fever in children, based on the finding of a degree of diagnostic sensitivity as high as 95.45% and 90.91% for respectively IgM and IgG, a diagnostic specificity as high as 93.33% for IgM as well as for IgG, a high diagnostic efficiency (94.32% for IgM and 92.05% for IgG), a high diagnostic positive predictive value of 93.33% for IgM and 93.02% for IgG, high negative predictive values of 95.35% for IgM and 91.11% for IgG for use under clinical as well as under field conditions.","Handojo I, Dewi R",Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health,2000 Dec,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia

Blood and bone marrow cultures and cytokine profiles during therapy were done to compare the clinical and bacteriological efficacies of these drugs. All patients were randomly assigned to receive chloramphenicol (500 mg four times a day orally) for 14 days or ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice a day orally) for 7 days. In each treatment group, patients were subsequently randomized to have blood and bone marrow cultured after either 3 or 5 days of treatment. Twenty-seven patients received chloramphenicol, and 28 received ciprofloxacin. The two groups were similar in terms of baseline characteristics. No significant differences in clinical cure and time to defervescence were found. All strains isolated were susceptible to both antibiotics. Although ciprofloxacin was more effective in the elimination of Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi and Paratyphi A from bone marrow than chloramphenicol, there was still an impressive persistence of Salmonella in the bone marrow culture (67%). In the ciprofloxacin-treated patients the suppressed cytokine production capacity showed a trend to normalize earlier than in patients treated with chloramphenicol.","Gasem MH, Keuter M, Dolmans WM, Van Der Ven-Jongekrijg J, Djokomoeljanto R, Van Der Meer JW",Antimicrob Agents Chemother,2003 May,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
36074783,The characteristics of bacteremia among patients with acute febrile illness requiring hospitalization in Indonesia.,"Blood culturing remains the ""gold standard"" for bloodstream infection (BSI) diagnosis, but the method is inaccessible to many developing countries due to high costs and insufficient resources. To better understand the utility of blood cultures among patients in Indonesia, a country where blood cultures are not routinely performed, we evaluated data from a previous cohort study that included blood cultures for all participants. An acute febrile illness study was conducted from July 2013 to June 2016 at eight major hospitals in seven provincial capitals in Indonesia. All participants presented with a fever, and two-sided aerobic blood cultures were performed within 48 hours of hospital admission. Positive cultures were further assessed for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns. Specimens from participants with negative culture results were screened by advanced molecular and serological methods for evidence of causal pathogens. Blood cultures were performed for 1,459 of 1,464 participants, and the 70.6% (1,030) participants that were negative by dengue NS1 antigen test were included in further analysis. Bacteremia was observed in 8.9% (92) participants, with the most frequent pathogens being Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (41) and Paratyphi A (10), Escherichia coli (14), and Staphylococcus aureus (10). Two S. Paratyphi A cases had evidence of AMR, and several E. coli cases were multidrug resistant (42.9%, 6/14) or monoresistant (14.3%, 2/14). Culture contamination was observed in 3.6% (37) cases. Molecular and serological assays identified etiological agents in participants having negative cultures, with 23.1% to 90% of cases being missed by blood cultures. Blood cultures are a valuable diagnostic tool for hospitalized patients presenting with fever. In Indonesia, pre-screening patients for the most common viral infections, such as dengue, influenza, and chikungunya viruses, would maximize the benefit to the patient while also conserving resources.

18322069,"High-throughput genotyping of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi allowing geographical assignment of haplotypes and pathotypes within an urban District of Jakarta, Indonesia.","High-throughput epidemiological typing systems that provide phylogenetic and genotypic information are beneficial for tracking bacterial pathogens in the field. The incidence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi infection in Indonesia is high and is associated with atypical phenotypic traits such as expression of the j and the z66 flagellum antigens. Utilizing a high-throughput genotyping platform to investigate known nucleotide polymorphisms dispersed around the genome, we determined the haplotypes of 140 serovar Typhi isolates associated with Indonesia. We identified nine distinct serovar Typhi haplotypes circulating in Indonesia for more than 30 years, with eight of these present in a single Jakarta suburb within a 2-year period. One dominant haplotype, H59, is associated with j and z66 flagellum expression, representing a potential pathotype unique to Indonesia. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that H59 z66(+), j(+) isolates emerged relatively recently in terms of the origin of serovar Typhi and are geographically restricted. These data demonstrate the potential of high-throughput genotyping platforms for analyzing serovar Typhi populations in the field. The study also provides insight into the evolution of serovar Typhi and demonstrates the value of a molecular epidemiological technique that is exchangeable, that is internet friendly, and that has global utility.","Baker S, Holt K, van de Vosse E, Roumagnac P, Whitehead S, King E, Ewels P, Keniry A, Weill FX, Lightfoot D, van Dissel JT, Sanderson KE, Farrar J, Achtman M, Deloukas P, Dougan G",J Clin Microbiol,2008 May,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia

The current study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of MT cases in Bandung, West Java. Non-confirmed AFI cases (n = 176) from a prospective cohort study of whom paired serum samples (acute (T1), midterm (T2), or convalescent (T3)) were available were screened using MT serology. IgG against R. typhi was detected in the T2 or T3 samples using an in-house ELISA. Positive IgG samples were further screened for the presence of IgM. If both IgM and IgG were positive, the endpoint titer of T1, T2, or T3 was determined. In cases with a fourfold increase in titer, real-time PCR of T1 samples was performed to detect R. typhi DNA. In total, 71/176 (40.3%) patients tested positive for IgG antibody, and 26 AFI cases were confirmed as MT (23 cases by PCR, 3 cases by fourfold titer increased IgG or IgM titer). The most common clinical symptoms in the confirmed cases were headache (80%), arthralgia (73%), malaise (69%), and myalgia (54%). In these cases, the presumptive clinical diagnoses were typhoid fever (43.2%), dengue (38.5%), and leptospirosis (19.2%). MT was not considered in any of the patients, and no patients received doxycycline. These findings confirmed that MT is an important cause of AFI in Indonesia. MT should be included in the differential diagnosis of AFI, and empirical treatment with doxycycline should be considered.","Riswari SF, Prodjosoewojo S, Mony SR, Megantara I, Iskandar S, Mayasari W, Heryaman H, Mast Q, der Ven AV, Kosasih H, Alisjahbana B",PLoS One,2023,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia

Analysis of the serum anti-Vi IgG response following immunisation against typhoid confirms the immunogenicity of TCVs and forms an important part of the pathway to licensing. Comparative studies could expedite the licencing process, and the availability of a standardised ELISA method alongside the 1st International Standard (IS) 16/138 for anti-typhoid capsular Vi polysaccharide IgG (human) will facilitate this process. To this end, a non-commercial ELISA based on a coat of Vi and poly-l-lysine (Vi-PLL ELISA) was evaluated by 10 laboratories. Eight serum samples, including IS 16/138, were tested in the standardised Vi-PLL ELISA (n = 10), a commercial Vi ELISA (n = 3) and a biotinylated Vi ELISA (n = 1). Valid estimates of potencies relative to IS 16/138 were obtained for all samples in the Vi-PLL ELISA and the commercial ELISA, with good repeatability and reproducibility evident from the study results and concordant estimates obtained by the two ELISA methods. The study demonstrates that the Vi-PLL ELISA can be used in clinical trial studies to determine the immunogenicity of TCVs.","Rigsby P, Beamish E, Hockley J, Atkinson E, Hitri K, Jones E, Yang JS, Qadri F, Bachtiar NS, Elias SC, Goel A, Mishra R, Dugyala R, Pasetti MF, Meiring JE, Mbewe M, Gordon MA, Pollard AJ, Logan A, Rijpkema S",Biologicals,2020 Jul,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
15750137,Typhoid fever associated with acute appendicitis caused by an H1-j strain of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi.,"While most strains of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi, the etiologic agent of typhoid fever, have only a phase 1 flagellar antigen, H1-d, variations of the flagellar antigen have been observed. Although H1-j strains (one of the flagellar antigen variants) account for 10 to 50% of S. enterica serotype Typhi strains found in Indonesia, there have been no published data to suggest its existence in other parts of the world. We describe a case of typhoid fever associated with acute appendicitis caused by an S. enterica serotype Typhi H1-j strain in a Chinese woman in Hong Kong. A gram-negative, motile rod was recovered from her blood and stool cultures. Conventional biochemical tests and the Vitek system (GNI+) showed that the bacterium was S. enterica serotype Typhi. The isolate agglutinated with poly(O), 9O, Vi and H1-j Salmonella antisera but not with poly(H) antisera. The patient developed antibodies against only S. enterica serotype Typhi O antigens but not against H1-d antigen by the Widal test. Flagellin C gene (fliC) sequencing showed a 261-bp deletion in the fliC gene of the isolate, confirming that the isolate possessed the H1-j antigen. The patient had no past history of travel to Indonesia or personal contact with any Indonesian. She recovered with appendectomy and antibiotic treatment. Further studies should be performed to determine the prevalence of this unusual S. enterica serotype Typhi strain in our locality.","Lau SK, Woo PC, Chan CY, Woo WL, Woo GK, Yuen KY",J Clin Microbiol,2005 Mar,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
30759132,Six-month follow up of a randomized clinical trial-phase I study in Indonesian adults and children: Safety and immunogenicity of Salmonella typhi polysaccharide-diphtheria toxoid (Vi-DT) conjugate vaccine.,"INTRODUCTION: There is a high global incidence of typhoid fever, with an annual mortality rate of 200,000 deaths. Typhoid fever also affects younger children, particularly in resource-limited settings in endemic countries. Typhoid vaccination is an important prevention tool against typhoid fever. However, the available polysaccharide typhoid vaccines are not recommended for children under 2 years of age. A new typhoid conjugate Vi-diphtheria toxoid (Vi-DT) vaccine has been developed for infant immunization. We aimed to define the safety and immunogenicity of the Vi-DT vaccine among adults and children in Indonesia. METHODS: An observational, blinded, comparative, randomized, phase I safety study in two age de-escalating cohorts was conducted in East Jakarta, Indonesia, from April 2017 to February 2018. We enrolled 100 healthy subjects in 2 age groups: adults and children (18-40 and 2-5 years old). These groups were randomized into study groups (Vi-DT vaccine), and comparator groups (Vi-polysaccharide (Vi-PS) vaccine and another additional vaccine) which was administered in 4 weeks apart. Subjects were followed up to six months. RESULT: One hundred healthy adults and children subjects completed the study. The Vi-DT and Vi-PS vaccines showed no difference in terms of intensity of any immediate local and systemic events within 30 minutes post-vaccination. Overall, pain was the most common local reaction, and muscle pain was the most common systemic reaction in the first 72 hours. No serious adverse events were deemed related to vaccine administration. The first and second doses of the Vi-DT vaccine induced seroconversion and higher geometric mean titers (GMT) in all subjects compared to that of baseline. However, in terms of GMT, the second dose of Vi-DT did not induce a booster response. CONCLUSION: The Vi-DT vaccine is safe and immunogenic in adults and children older than two years. A single dose of the vaccine is able to produce seroconversion and high GMT in all individuals.","Medise BE, Soedjatmiko S, Rengganis I, Gunardi H, Sekartini R, Koesno S, Satari HI, Hadinegoro SR, Yang JS, Excler JL, Sahastrabuddhe S, Puspita M, Sari RM, Bachtiar NS",PLoS One,2019,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
8929638,Plasma endotoxin in typhoid fever.,"Plasma endotoxin contents of the patients with sepsis or typhoid fever were measured by two sophisticated chromogenic limulus tests; Endospecy and Toxicolor tests. Endospecy test is the endotoxin-specific test and Toxicolor is responsible for both endotoxin and (1,3)-beta-D-glucan. Plasma was pretreated by our new PCA method which resolved the problem as to the detection of a lesser amount of plasma endotoxin when pretreated by the conventional PCA method. Although Toxicolor values have been reported to exceed more than the Endospecy value, under complicated pathophysiological situations, almost all specimens of these patients had a similar value, except in one expired septic shock case. In 18 typhoid fever cases, Salmonella typhi was isolated only from the bile in 5 cases, however endotoxemia occurred in 11 cases (61.1%). Within the first 4 days, the incidence of endotoxemia was higher (10/14, 71.4%). These results suggest that endotoxin assay seemed to be a useful tool for the diagnosis of typhoid fever.","Suyasa IG, Reka IG, Inada K, Suda H, Kojima M, Mushiaki K, Okamoto S, Yoshida M",Kobe J Med Sci,1995 Oct,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia

Only minor differences in envelope protein patterns were apparent among strains. Strains from 7 of 20 Indonesian patients had a distinct chromosomal digest pattern compared with patterns of Peruvian and other Indonesian strains. Strains with this pattern carried the gene for the j flagellar antigen (H1-j); differences in response to envelope proteins of j and d strains were noted on immunoblot analysis. Our data suggest that there are genotypic and phenotypic differences among S. typhi strains. The clinical importance of these differences remains to be fully evaluated; however, in this study it was not possible to show a clear correlation between strain characteristics and disease severity.","Franco A, Gonzalez C, Levine OS, Lagos R, Hall RH, Hoffman SL, Moechtar MA, Gotuzzo E, Levine MM, Hone DM, et al.",J Clin Microbiol,1992 Aug,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia

A cross-sectional survey in Indonesia compared epidemiologic, clinical, and pathogenetic characteristics of these two serotypes. S. typhi isolates were collected from patients with acute typhoid fever in four Indonesian cities. Flagellar serotype was determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the fliC locus of the flg gene. Of 321 isolates, 51 (15.9%) were H1-j. Patients with H1-j infection were older than those with H1-d (P < .001). Among 30 patients with known clinical outcomes, H1-j infection was associated with milder clinical illness than H1-d (P = .06). In vitro, H1-j isolates were both less motile on semi-solid agar plates (P = .004) and less invasive of HEp-2 cells (P = .002) than H1-d isolates. The association of decreased severity of illness with decreased motility and invasiveness suggests that flagellar properties are a component of S. typhi's virulence.","Grossman DA, Witham ND, Burr DH, Lesmana M, Rubin FA, Schoolnik GK, Parsonnet J",J Infect Dis,1995 Jan,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
16359401,A multi-country cluster randomized controlled effectiveness evaluation to accelerate the introduction of Vi polysaccharide typhoid vaccine in developing countries in Asia: rationale and design.,"Phase-III vaccine efficacy trials typically employ individually randomized designs intended to ensure that measurements of vaccine protective efficacy reflect only direct vaccine effects. As a result, decisions about introducing newly licensed vaccines into public health programmes often fail to consider the substantially greater protection that may occur when a vaccine is deployed in public health programmes, due to the combination of direct plus indirect vaccine protective effects. Vaccine total protection can be better evaluated with cluster randomized trials. Such a design was considered to generate policy relevant data to accelerate the rationale introduction of the licensed typhoid fever Vi polysaccharide (PS) vaccine in Asia by the Diseases of the Most Impoverished (DOMI) typhoid fever programme. The DOMI's programme multi-country study is one of the largest cluster randomized vaccine trials ever mounted in Asia, which includes approximately 200,000 individuals. Its main objective is to determine the effectiveness of a licensed Vi PS vaccine. The rationale and design of this study are discussed.

We retrospectively examined microbiologically confirmed cases of enteric fever in adult returned travellers over an 18-year period presenting to two tertiary referral hospitals in Melbourne, Australia. There were 59 cases of Salmonella typhi infection, 43 cases of S. paratyphi A infection and two cases of S. paratyphi B infection. Most patients reported recent travel to India (36%) or Indonesia (29%). NAR isolates were commonly encountered (41% of all isolates), particularly from India (75%), Pakistan (80%) and Bangladesh (60%). The number of NAR isolates increased progressively after 2003. Patients with NAR isolates had prolonged mean fever clearance time (5.6 vs. 3.3 days, P = 0.03) and prolonged hospital stay (7.9 vs. 5.7 days, P = 0.02) compared to non-resistant isolates. This represents the largest report of NAR enteric fever in returned travellers. NAR isolates predominate in cases of enteric fever from South Asia and result in prolonged fever clearance time and hospital stay. Empiric therapy with alternative antibiotics such as ceftriaxone or azithromycin should be considered in patients with suspected enteric fever from this region.","Hume S, Schulz T, Vinton P, Korman T, Torresi J",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,2009 Aug,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
30726315,beta-Glucan of Candida albicans Cell Wall Extract Inhibits Salmonella Typhimurium Colonization by Potentiating Cellular Immunity (CD8 + and CD4 + T Cells).,"INTRODUCTION: Antimicrobial resistance has been reported in the drugs used for the treatment of typhoid fever. The immunomodulatory substance beta-glucan can be used as an alternative therapy as it potentiates host immunity. The aims of this study are to observe the effect of Candida albicans cell wall (CCW) extract towards host immunity (TCD8+ and TCD4+ cells in spleen, intestinal sIgA) and its capacity to kill Salmonella in the intestine and liver of typhoid fever mice models. METHODS: Typhoid fever mice models were created by infecting mice with S. Typhimurium orally. Mice were divided into four groups: the Non-Infected, Infected, CCW (infected mice treated with 300 microg CCW extract/mouse once a day), and Ciprofloxacin groups (infected mice treated with 15 mg/kg BW ciprofloxacin twice a day). RESULTS: Secretory IgA (sIgA) concentrations of mice in the CCW group remained unchanged. However, their TCD4+ and TCD8+ cells increased substantially compared to those in the Non-Infected group. In the Ciprofloxacin group, sIgA concentrations increased markedly compared to those in the Non-Infected and CCW groups; TCD4+ and TCD8+ cells also increased significantly compared to those in the Infected Group, but not significant compared to those in the CCW group. Colonization of S. Typhimurium in the intestine and liver decreased significantly in the CCW and Ciprofloxacin groups compared to that in the Infected group, with the lowest reduction being found in the Ciprofloxacin group. CONCLUSIONS: The inhibition of S. Typhimurium colonization by CCW is associated with the increase in TCD4+ and TCD8+ cells.","Winarsih S, Kosasih T, Putera MA, Rahmadhiani N, Poernomo EL, Runtuk KS, Oswari MV",Rev Soc Bras Med Trop,2019 Jan 31,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Epidemiological records of all reported enteric fevers maintained by the Communicable Diseases Division, Ministry of Health from 1990 to 2009 were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 2464 laboratory confirmed cases of enteric fevers (1699 cases of typhoid and 765 cases of paratyphoid) were reported. Of these, 75% were imported, mainly from India and Indonesia. There had been a significant fall in the mean annual incidence rate of indigenous enteric fevers from 4.3 per 100,000 population in 1990 to 0.26 per 100,000 population in 2009 (P <0.005) with a corresponding increase in the proportion of imported cases from 71% between 1990 and 1993 to 92% between 2006 and 2009 (P <0.0005). Imported cases involving foreign contract workers increased significantly from 12.8% between 1990 and 1993 to 40.4% between 2006 and 2009 (P <0.0005). CONCLUSION: Singapore has experienced a marked decline in the incidence of enteric fevers that is now comparable to that of other developed countries. Continued vigilance and proactive measures that address the changing epidemiology of enteric fevers in Singapore are necessary to sustain the milestone achieved in the past 2 decades.","Ty AU, Ang GY, Ang LW, James L, Goh KT",Ann Acad Med Singap,2010 Dec,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia
18835415,The cost-effectiveness of typhoid Vi vaccination programs: calculations for four urban sites in four Asian countries.,"The burden of typhoid fever remains high in impoverished settings, and increasing antibiotic resistance is making treatment costly. One strategy for reducing the typhoid morbidity and mortality is vaccination with the Vi polysaccharide vaccine. We use a wealth of new economic and epidemiological data to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Vi vaccination against typhoid in sites in four Asian cities: Kolkata (India), Karachi (Pakistan), North Jakarta (Indonesia), and Hue (Vietnam). We report results from both a societal as well as a public sector financial perspective. Baseline disease burden estimates in the four areas are: 750 cases per year in two Kolkata neighborhoods (pop 185,000); 84 cases per year in the city of Hue (pop 280,000); 298 cases per year in two sub-districts in North Jakarta (pop 161,000), and 538 cases per year in three squatter settlements in Karachi (pop 102,000). We estimate that a vaccination program targeting all children (2-14.9) would prevent 456, 158, and 258 typhoid cases (and 4.6, 1.6, and 2.6 deaths), and avert 126, 44, and 72 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) over 3 years in Kolkata, North Jakarta and Karachi, respectively. The net social costs would be US$160 and US$549, per DALY averted in Kolkata and North Jakarta, respectively. These programs, along with a similar program in Karachi, would be considered ""very cost-effective"" (e.g. costs per DALY averted less than per capita gross national income (GNI)) under a wide range of assumptions. Community-based vaccination programs that also target adults in Kolkata and Jakarta are less cost-effective because incidence is lower in adults than children, but are also likely to be ""very cost-effective"". A program targeting school-aged children in Hue, Vietnam would prevent 21 cases, avert 6 DALYs, and not be cost-effective (US$3779 per DALY averted) because of the low typhoid incidence there.","Cook J, Jeuland M, Whittington D, Poulos C, Clemens J, Sur D, Anh DD, Agtini M, Bhutta Z",Vaccine,2008 Nov 25,Typhoid Fever AND Indonesia

In the past two centuries, cholera has emerged and spread from the Ganges Delta six times and from Indonesia once to cause global pandemics. Rational approaches to the case management of cholera with oral and intravenous rehydration therapy have reduced the case fatality of cholera from more than 50% to much less than 1%. Despite improvements in water quality, sanitation, and hygiene, as well as in the clinical treatment of cholera, the disease is still estimated to cause about 100 000 deaths every year. Most deaths occur in cholera-endemic settings, and virtually all deaths occur in developing countries. Contemporary understanding of immune protection against cholera, which results from local intestinal immunity, has yielded safe and protective orally administered cholera vaccines that are now globally stockpiled for use in the control of both epidemic and endemic cholera.","Clemens JD, Nair GB, Ahmed T, Qadri F, Holmgren J",Lancet,2017 Sep 23,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia

Reliable data on the economic burden of diarrhea is required to support the selection of appropriate health intervention programs. This study aimed to estimate the costs of acute diarrhea in children under five years of age in Indonesia, a large middle-income country with a substantial diarrheal burden. METHODS: Direct medical cost data were extracted retrospectively for 1050 children under five years of age with acute diarrhea receiving inpatient care across 45 health facilities in seven Indonesian provinces during 2017-2020. Direct medical costs for children treated in outpatient settings were estimated by collecting unit costs associated with standard diarrhea case management in children. A structured interview of 240 caregivers of inpatients was also conducted retrospectively to estimate direct non-medical costs as well as indirect costs from caregiver income loss. RESULTS: The weighted average direct medical cost for treatment of acute diarrhea as an inpatient and outpatient across health facility types was US$99.8 (SD+/-$56.8)(35% room costs, 29% professional fees, 26% medication costs, 10% diagnostic costs) and US$7.6 (SD+/-$4.3) (34% diagnostic costs, 28% medication costs, 27% professional fees, 10% registration fees), respectively. The average direct non-medical household cost for an acute diarrheal admission was US$4.90 and the indirect cost was US$9.90. CONCLUSION: There is a significant economic burden associated with acute diarrhea in children in Indonesia. This study, based on a wide variety of health care settings and geographical regions, provides data to inform the economic evaluation of rotavirus vaccines and other diarrheal prevention programs.

26978330,"Review on a Traditional Herbal Medicine, Eurycoma longifolia Jack (Tongkat Ali): Its Traditional Uses, Chemistry, Evidence-Based Pharmacology and Toxicology.","Eurycoma longifolia Jack (known as tongkat ali), a popular traditional herbal medicine, is a flowering plant of the family Simaroubaceae, native to Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and also Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos and Thailand. E. longifolia, is one of the well-known folk medicines for aphrodisiac effects as well as intermittent fever (malaria) in Asia. Decoctions of E. longifolia leaves are used for washing itches, while its fruits are used in curing dysentery. Its bark is mostly used as a vermifuge, while the taproots are used to treat high blood pressure, and the root bark is used for the treatment of diarrhea and fever. Mostly, the roots extract of E. longifolia are used as folk medicine for sexual dysfunction, aging, malaria, cancer, diabetes, anxiety, aches, constipation, exercise recovery, fever, increased energy, increased strength, leukemia, osteoporosis, stress, syphilis and glandular swelling. The roots are also used as an aphrodisiac, antibiotic, appetite stimulant and health supplement. The plant is reported to be rich in various classes of bioactive compounds such as quassinoids, canthin-6-one alkaloids, beta-carboline alkaloids, triterpene tirucallane type, squalene derivatives and biphenyl neolignan, eurycolactone, laurycolactone, and eurycomalactone, and bioactive steroids. Among these phytoconstituents, quassinoids account for a major portion of the E. longifolia root phytochemicals. An acute toxicity study has found that the oral Lethal Dose 50 (LD50) of the alcoholic extract of E. longifolia in mice is between 1500-2000 mg/kg, while the oral LD50 of the aqueous extract form is more than 3000 mg/kg. Liver and renal function tests showed no adverse changes at normal daily dose and chronic use of E. longifolia. Based on established literature on health benefits of E. longifolia, it is important to focus attention on its more active constituents and the constituents' identification, determination, further development and most importantly, the standardization. Besides the available data, more evidence is required regarding its therapeutic efficacy and safety, so it can be considered a rich herbal source of new drug candidates. It is very important to conserve this valuable medicinal plant for the health benefit of future generations.","Rehman SU, Choe K, Yoo HH",Molecules,2016 Mar 10,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia

At age 22-24 week, infants with reported diarrhea within 2 weeks of an assessment had low use of oral rehydration solutions (ORS) (3/21;14%) and zinc therapy (2/ 21;10%). CONCLUSION: In this unique observational study, breastfeeding rates of 60% at 6 months were below the Indonesian national target of >75%. Adherence to WHO guidelines for management of ARI and diarrhea was poor, with high use of non-recommended cough medications and oral bronchodilators in the first 6 months of life and low use of ORS and zinc therapy. Ongoing education of primary health care workers and parents regarding management of common illness is needed in Indonesia.","Oktaria V, Lee KJ, Bines JE, Watts E, Satria CD, Atthobari J, Nirwati H, Kirkwood CD, Soenarto Y, Danchin MH",BMC Pediatr,2017 Dec 21,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
6268656,"Acute diarrhea and rotavirus infection in newborn babies and children in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, from June 1978 to June 1979.","A longitudinal study of acute diarrhea in children in Yogyakarta, Indonesia (June 1978 to June 1979), showed little variation throughout most months of the year in numbers of children admitted to hospital and in numbers infected with rotaviruses. Both decreased during November and December coincidentally with seasonal change from dry to wet conditions. Rotavirus particles were identified by electron microscopy in fecal specimens from 126 of 334 (38%) infants and children with acute diarrhea. Nosocomial rotavirus infections occurred in 11% of control children admitted to hospital for other reasons. Socioeconomic level and preexisting nutritional status did not influence the incidence of rotavirus excretion. Rotavirus infections were most common in children aged 6 to 24 months. There was a low incidence of infection in infants less than 6 months old. Rotavirus infection was seldom observed in newborn babies delivered in an urban hospital nursery, in a rural health center, or at home. One of 72 newborn babies with diarrhea excreted rotavirus. One of 53 healthy newborn babies excreted rotavirus. It is concluded that, in Indonesia, rotavirus infection is a major cause of childhood diarrhea throughout the year, but is an uncommon cause of diarrhea in newborn babies.","Soenarto Y, Sebodo T, Ridho R, Alrasjid H, Rohde JE, Bugg HC, Barnes GL, Bishop RF",J Clin Microbiol,1981 Aug,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
30252355,Vibrio cholerae Infection.,"Toxigenic strains of Vibrio cholerae are a major cause of acute, severe, dehydrating diarrhea in low- and middle-income countries with unsatisfactory hygienic conditions and those affected by natural disasters and humanitarian crises.  V cholerae is a gram-negative, comma-shaped bacterium that causes acute, large-volume, watery diarrhea that can result in rapid dehydration and hypovolemia. Cholera is a rapidly progressing illness and is associated with high mortality rates if not treated promptly. The case fatality ratio can exceed 50% without appropriate treatment but decreases to less than 1% when prompt rehydration and antibiotics are administered.  V cholerae is transmitted through the fecal-oral route by contaminated water or food. Risk factors for acquiring V cholera include poverty, inadequate sanitation, contaminated water, and food. Cases of cholera are commonly underreported for many reasons, including a lack of appropriate surveillance and resources. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that annually there are 1.4 to 4.0 million cases and 21,000 to 143,000 deaths worldwide from cholera. Historically, cholera has been endemic in the Asian subcontinent, but it has also established itself in other regions and is now endemic in Latin and Central America and sub-Saharan Africa. Over the past 2 centuries, V cholerae has caused 7 pandemics. The seventh pandemic, which is still ongoing, was first reported in 1961 in Sulawesi, an island governed by Indonesia, in 1971 in Africa, and in 1991 in the Americas. V cholerae is constantly evolving, with new genotypes and phenotypes emerging, most likely due to antibiotic pressure. Cholera continues to be a significant public health threat for many reasons: its endemicity is expanding, outbreaks are unpredictable, it has high morbidity and mortality, it is underdetected and underreported, antimicrobial resistance is increasing, and resources for treatment are inadequate. The WHO's Global Task Force for Cholera Control (GTFCC), a global network of partners coordinated by the WHO, established an initiative with a goal to reduce cholera globally by 90% and eradicate the disease in at least 20 countries by 2030. Appropriate oral and intravenous rehydration therapy and administering antibiotics and electrolytes are the cornerstones for treating cholera. Oral cholera vaccines are a significant component of the treatment and control strategies implemented in endemic zones or during an outbreak. These vaccines have been shown to be effective in preventing and managing cholera. Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) practices are also crucial in preventing the transmission of V cholera.","Ojeda Rodriguez JA, Hashmi MF, Kahwaji CI",No journal Title,2025 Jan,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
35742029,Hepatitis of Unknown Origin and Etiology (Acute Non HepA-E Hepatitis) among Children in 2021/2022: Review of the Current Findings.,"Several clusters and individual cases of acute hepatitis have been reported in the US, Europe and recently in Asia and Central America since October 2021. A laboratory investigation of the common viral hepatitis agents (HAV, HBV, HCV, HDV and HEV) yielded negative results prompting the use of the term ""acute non HepA-E hepatitis"" to describe this condition. The cases were characterized by the manifestations of acute hepatitis (abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice and very high levels of liver enzymes) affecting children with a median age of 3-4 years. The exact underlying etiology has not been revealed yet; however, a leading hypothesis is that an infectious agent is the culprit, underlying cause or a risk factor for acute non HepA-E hepatitis occurrence. So far, laboratory testing has shown the presence of the group F human adenovirus serotype 41 (HAdV-F41) in about three-fourths of the investigated cases. As of 13 May 2022, more than 450 cases were reported worldwide, the majority of which were in the UK (n = 176), the US (n = 109), 13 European countries (at least 103 cases) and in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Palestine, Panama, Singapore and South Korea. Vigilant surveillance and epidemiologic investigations to identify further cases are warranted to delineate the features of this emergent public health issue. The possible role of environmental and toxic agents including foodborne toxins should also be considered. Specific guidelines for identification of further cases are necessary, particularly in low-income settings where testing for adenoviruses is not considered routinely. A genetic analysis of HAdV-F41 isolates is recommended to assess the potential changes in the virus genome with subsequent possible altered virus behavior. Immunopathogenesis is another possibility that should be evaluated considering the lack of viral structures in liver biopsies of the affected children in the US.","Sallam M, Mahafzah A, Sahin GO, On Behalf Of Escmid Study Group For Viral Hepatitis-Esgvh",Healthcare (Basel),2022 May 24,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia

Bacterial pathogens isolated from hospital patients were, in decreasing frequency, Vibrio cholerae O1, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter jejuni, while S. flexneri, V. cholerae O1, Salmonella spp. and C. jejuni were isolated from the community patients. V. cholerae O1 was isolated more frequently (P<0.005) from the hospital patients than the community patients. Overall, bacterial pathogens were isolated from 538 of 3875 (14%) enrolled cases of diarrhea. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli were detected in 218 (18%) of 1244 rectal swabs. A small percentage of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (1%) and of Clostridium difficile (1.3%) was detected. Parasitic examination of 389 samples resulted in 43 (11%) positives comprising Ascaris lumbricoides (1.5%), Blastocystis hominis (5.7%), Giardia lamblia (0.8%), Trichuris trichiura (2.1%) and Endolimax nana (0.5%). Rotavirus (37.5%), adenovirus (3.3%) and Norwalk-like virus (17.6%) were also detected. Antimicrobial resistance was observed among some isolates. Bacterial isolates were susceptible to quinolones, with the exception of some isolates of C. jejuni which were resistant to ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid and norfloxacin.

23770798,Clinical approach and management of chronic diarrhea.,"Chronic diarrhea is defined as the passage of loose stools that last for more than 4 weeks. Although generally it is estimated that the prevalence of chronic diarrhea only ranges 3-5% of population, but it poses some specific equally essential challenges compared to acute diarrhea because there are many differential diagnosis that should be considered as the cause of chronic diarrhea. One of them includes colorectal cancer and the small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, known as SIBO. In general, chronic diarrhea can be categorized into watery, malabsorption, and inflammatory diarrhea. A proper history taking, physical examination and laboratory investigation is therefore necessary for clinician in managing chronic diarrhea. Overall, the management of chronic diarrhea includes two types, i.e. supportive and pharmacological management both for infectious and non-infectious etiologies. Pharmacological treatment can also be classified into two kinds of treatment including symptomatic and causal treatment, which can be achieved through empirical therapy.","Abdullah M, Firmansyah MA",Acta Med Indones,2013 Apr,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia

After adequate oral rehydration, the patients were randomly assigned to receive either a low lactose infant formula supplemented with added precooked rice (1.5 g/100mL) with the above active ingredients (study group) or a low lactose infant formula with added precooked rice without the above active ingredient supplement (control group). No antibiotic, anti-secretory drug or antiemetic was given at all. Both study and control groups showed similar outcomes for weight gain and stool weight. The duration of diarrhea was significantly shorter in the study group than in the control group (1.63 versus 2.45 days; p<0.05; for the study and control group respectively). No treatment failure or other side effects were observed during the course of the study. The present study supports the evidence for the efficacy of a special anti-diarrhea infant formula containing probiotic, prebiotic, fiber and iron+zinc after oral rehydration by shortening the duration of infantile diarrhea in developing countries. However, from the results of our study we cannot discern the individual contribution of the active ingredients and also not whether they may act independent from each other or in a synergistic way.","Agustina R, Lukito W, Firmansyah A, Suhardjo HN, Murniati D, Bindels J",Asia Pac J Clin Nutr,2007,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
25793014,"Genotyping and clinical factors in pediatric diarrhea caused by rotaviruses: one-year surveillance in Surabaya, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: Rotavirus infections are a major cause of diarrhea in children in both developed and developing countries. Rotavirus genetics, patient immunity, and environmental factors are thought to be related to the severity of acute diarrhea due to rotavirus in infants and young children. The objective of this study was to provide a correlation between rotavirus genotypes, clinical factors and degree of severity of acute diarrhea in children under 5 years old in Surabaya, Indonesia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in children aged 1-60 months with acute diarrhea hospitalized in Soetomo Hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia from April to December 2013. Rotavirus in stool specimens was identified by ELISA and genotyping (G-type and P-type) using multiplex reverse transcription PCR. Severity was measured using the Ruuska and Vesikari scoring system. The clinical factors were investigated included patient's age (months), hydration, antibiotic administration, nutritional state, co-bacterial infection and co-viral infection. RESULTS: A total of 88 children met the criteria; 80.7% were aged 6-24 months, watery diarrhea was the most common type (77.3%) and 73.6% of the subjects were co-infected with bacteria, of which pathogenic Escherichia coli was the most common (42.5%). The predominant VP7 genotyping (G-type) was G2 (31.8%) and that of VP4 genotyping (P-type) was P[4] (31.8%). The predominant rotavirus genotype was G2P[4] (19.3%); G1P[4] and G9P[4] were uncommon with a prevalence of 4.5%. There were significant differences between the common genotype and uncommon genotype with respect to the total severity score of diarrhea (p <0.05). G3, G4 and G9 were significantly correlated with severe diarrhea (p = 0.009) in multivariate analyses and with frequency of diarrhea (>10 times a day) (p = 0.045) in univariate analyses, but there was no significant correlation between P typing and severity of diarrhea. For combination genotyping of G and P, G2P[4] was significantly correlated with severe diarrhea in multivariate analyses (p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: There is a correlation between rotavirus genotype and severity of acute diarrhea in children. Genotype G2P[4] has the highest prevalence. G3, G4, G9 and G2P[4] combination genotype were found to be associated with severe diarrhea.","Sudarmo SM, Shigemura K, Athiyyah AF, Osawa K, Wardana OP, Darma A, Ranuh R, Raharjo D, Arakawa S, Fujisawa M, Shirakawa T",Gut Pathog,2015,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
26848437,Detection of group A rotavirus strains circulating among children with acute diarrhea in Indonesia.,"Rotavirus is the major cause of severe diarrhea in children under 5 years old in developed and developing countries. Since improvements in sanitation and hygiene have limited impact on reducing the incidence of rotavirus diarrhea, implementation of a vaccine will be a better solution. We conducted an observational study to determine the disease burden and to identify the genotype of circulating rotavirus in Indonesia. Hospitalized children due to acute diarrhea were enrolled from four teaching hospitals in Indonesia. Stool samples were collected based on WHO protocol and were tested for the presence of group A rotavirus using enzyme immunoassay. Then, rotavirus positive samples were genotyped using RT-PCR. Fisher's Exact tests, Chi square tests and logistic regression were performed to determine differences across hospital and year in rotavirus prevalence and genotype distribution. There were 4235 samples from hospitalized children with diarrhea during 2006, 2009 and 2010. Among them, the rotavirus positive were 2220 samples (52.42 %) and incidence rates varied between hospitals. The G1P[8], G1P[6], and G2P[4] were recognized as the dominant genotypes circulating strains in Indonesia and the proportion of predominant strains changed by year. Our study showed the high incidence of rotavirus infection in Indonesia with G1P[8], G1P[6], and G2P[4] as the dominant strains circulating in Indonesia. These results reinforce the need for a continuing surveillance of rotavirus strain in Indonesia.","Nirwati H, Wibawa T, Aman AT, Wahab A, Soenarto Y",Springerplus,2016,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia

38510585,Detection of Enteropathogens in Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Non-Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Infected Children with Acute Diarrhea in an Indonesian Tertiary Hospital Using Multiplex Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction.,"PURPOSE: Diarrhea is one of the leading causes of mortality in children living in developing countries. The etiology of acute diarrhea in each healthcare center varies depending on place, time, and population. This study aimed to identify pathogen patterns in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and non-HIV children suffering from acute diarrhea, using multiplex real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), in an Indonesian tertiary hospital. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo National Hospital from March 2019 to April 2020. RESULTS: The study showed that multiplex RT-PCR results were positive in 58.9% of the specimens, with more positive results in HIV-infected children than in non-HIV-infected children (70% vs. 54.7%). Altogether 72 enteropathogens were detected from all specimens. Enteropathogens in non-HIV children with acute diarrhea consisted of bacteria (70.6%) and viruses (29.4%) with a predominance of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (25.4%), followed by Campylobacter spp. (11.8%), enteropathogenic E. coli (9.8%), Norovirus GII (7.8%), and Clostridium difficile (7.8%). Enteropathogens in HIV-infected children consisted of viruses (57.1%), bacteria (28.6%), and parasites (14.3%) comprising Norovirus GII (24%), Cryptosporidium spp. (14.3%), Campylobacter spp. (14.3%), Norovirus GI (14.3%), and Astrovirus (14.3%). Cryptosporidium spp. was the only parasite found in this study and was found only in HIV-infected children. In non-HIV children with acute diarrhea, most pathogens were invasive bacteria, while in HIV-infected children, more viral and parasite infections occurred, primarily caused by opportunistic pathogens. CONCLUSION: The pattern of enteropathogens can help clinicians determine further examinations and appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy for the patient.","Wulandari D, Febrian R, Dwipoerwantoro PG, Kurniati N",Pediatr Gastroenterol Hepatol Nutr,2024 Mar,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
31243786,"Phylogenetic and immunoinformatic analysis of VP4, VP7, and NSP4 genes of rotavirus strains circulating in children with acute gastroenteritis in Indonesia.","Rotavirus is a major cause of diarrhea in Indonesian children. However, rotavirus vaccines have not been introduced in the national immunization program of Indonesia. Understanding the genetic diversity and conserved antigenic regions of circulating strains are therefore essential to assess the potential efficacy of rotavirus vaccines. We collected fecal samples from hospitalized children less than 5 years of age with acute diarrhea. Rotavirus genotyping was performed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, followed by sequencing of the VP4, VP7, and NSP4 genes of representative strains. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to investigate their relationship with globally circulating strains. Conservational analysis, immunoinformatics, and epitope mapping in comparison to vaccine strains were also performed. The sequence analyses showed that differences of multiple amino acid residues existed between the VP4, VP7, and NSP4 antigenic regions of the vaccine strains and the Indonesian isolates. However, many predicted conserved epitopes with higher antigenicity were observed in the vaccine and Indonesian strains, conferring the importance of these epitopes. The identified epitopes showed a higher potential of rotavirus vaccine to be employed in Indonesia. It could also be helpful to inform the design of a peptide vaccine based on the conserved regions and epitopes in the viral proteins.","Nirwati H, Donato CM, Ikram A, Aman AT, Wibawa T, Kirkwood CD, Soenarto Y, Pan Q, Hakim MS",J Med Virol,2019 Oct,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
2814585,Acute diarrhoeal disease in India and Indonesia.,"Acute diarrhoea is still a leading cause of child mortality and morbidity, second only to pneumonia as a killer of children, in India and Indonesia. Untreated diarrhoea precipitates malnutrition and is often the underlying cause of marasmus and kwashiorkor. Shigella and salmonella dysenteries are responsible for about 60% of all cases in Indonesia and India. These bacillary agents respond well to trimethoprim. Amoebiasis responds well to metronidazole. Most cases can be managed in the home, even if the exact cause is unknown, by giving liquids or a simple rehydration drink. Diarrhoea can be prevented by improving communal sanitation and personal hygiene, and by giving breast as opposed to bottle feeding of infants. Earlier introduction of supplementary feeding could provide the child with higher energy reserves giving it a better chance of survival when diarrhoeal insults occur.","Edmundson SA, Edmundson WC",Soc Sci Med,1989,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Acute toxicity test was done in six groups of BALB/c mice using 100%, 50%, 25%, 12.5%, and 6.75% of goat bile and negative control. The death of mice was observed within 14 days. In the subacute toxicity test, the body weight and hematology parameters on day 0 and day 4 post-treatment were evaluated. The mice were closely observed for 28 days before plasma collection for the blood biochemistry evaluation. RESULTS: Mild diarrhea was observed in acute and subacute toxicity tests. No death of mice was observed in acute test. Goat bile did not inhibit the increase of the body weight of mice. A slight reduction in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels in mice treated with 25% and 50% goat bile, however, remained normal in mice treated with 100% goat bile. The red and white blood cell count were not affected. Liver and kidney functions were not affected by goat bile treatment as revealed by the plasma level of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine, which remained in the normal range. CONCLUSION: Goat bile treatment in BALB/c mice caused mild toxicity in mice. Hydrophobic bile acids may cause the toxicity of goat bile in mice; therefore, it is recommended that goat bile consumption not to be taken oftenly to avoid its harmful effect.","Arwati H, Hapsari WT, Wardhani KA, Aini KN, Bahalwan RR, Wardhani P, Sandhika W",Vet World,2020 Mar,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
30887229,Norovirus and rotavirus infections in children less than five years of age hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis in Indonesia.,"Rotaviruses and noroviruses are the most important viral causes of acute gastroenteritis in children. While previous studies of acute gastroenteritis in Indonesia mainly focused on rotavirus, here, we investigated the burden and epidemiology of norovirus and rotavirus disease. Children less than five years of age hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis were enrolled in this study from January to December 2015 at three participating hospitals. Rotavirus was detected by enzyme immunoassay (EIA), followed by genotyping by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Norovirus genogroups were determined by TaqMan-based quantitative RT-PCR. Among 406 enrolled children, 75 (18.47%), 223 (54.93%) and 29 (7.14%) cases were positive for norovirus, rotavirus and both viruses (mixed infections), respectively. Most cases clinically presented with fever, diarrhea, vomiting and some degree of dehydration. The majority (n = 69/75 [92%]) of the noroviruses identified belonged to genogroup II, and several genotypes were identified by sequencing a subset of samples. Among 35 samples tested for rotavirus genotype, the most prevalent genotype was G3P[8] (n = 30/35 [85.6%]). Our study suggests that the burden of norovirus diseases in Indonesian children should not be underestimated. It also shows the emergence of rotavirus genotype G3P[8] in Indonesia.","Nirwati H, Donato CM, Mawarti Y, Mulyani NS, Ikram A, Aman AT, Peppelenbosch MP, Soenarto Y, Pan Q, Hakim MS",Arch Virol,2019 Jun,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia

METHODS: We conducted a 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 494 healthy children aged 1 to 6 years who received low-lactose milk with low calcium content (LC;  approximately 50 mg/day; n = 124), regular calcium content (RC;  approximately 440 mg/day; n = 126), RC with 5.10(8) colony-forming units per day of Lactobacillus casei CRL431 (casei; n = 120), or RC with 5.10(8) colony-forming units per day of Lactobacillus reuteri DSM17938 (reuteri; n = 124). Number and duration of diarrhea and ARTIs episodes were primary and secondary outcomes, respectively. RESULTS: Incidence of World Health Organization-defined diarrhea (>/=3 loose/liquid stools in 24 hours) was not significantly different between RC and LC (relative risk [RR]: 0.99 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.62-1.58]), between casei and RC (RR: 1.21 [95% CI: 0.76-1.92]), or between reuteri and RC (RR: 0.76 [95% CI: 0.46-1.25]) groups. Incidence of all reported diarrhea (>/=2 loose/liquid stools in 24 hours) was significantly lower in the reuteri versus RC group (RR: 0.68 [95% CI: 0.46-0.99]). Irrespective of the definition used, reuteri significantly reduced diarrhea incidence in children with lower nutritional status (below-median height-and-weight-for-age z score). None of the interventions affected ARTIs. CONCLUSIONS: RC milk, alone or with L casei, did not reduce diarrhea or ARTIs in Indonesian children. L reuteri may prevent diarrhea, especially in children with lower nutritional status.","Agustina R, Kok FJ, van de Rest O, Fahmida U, Firmansyah A, Lukito W, Feskens EJ, van den Heuvel EG, Albers R, Bovee-Oudenhoven IM",Pediatrics,2012 May,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
2683122,Management of pneumonia in India and Indonesia.,"Although the death rates from neonatal tetanus have been lowered and the death rates from childhood diarrhoea are becoming lower in India and Indonesia, death rates from pneumonia have not yet begun to fall. Pneumonia has become the greatest killer of children and the most important cause of preventable death. The reason for this relative rise in significance may lie in the failure to realize that the majority of the most acute cases of respiratory illness are not viral but rather bacterial infections which rapidly respond to appropriate antibiotic therapy. This paper reviews recent research on the aetiology of pneumonia; it examines age distribution and regional variation in morbidity and mortality; and it concludes by suggesting appropriate pneumonia treatment and case management guidelines. The essential priority is to make procaine penicillin available to children presenting with cough and a respiratory rate over 50 breaths per minute. This alone would substantially reduce the number of child deaths in India and Indonesia.","Edmundson WC, Harris SA",Soc Sci Med,1989,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
36758015,Healthcare-seeking behavior for children aged 0-59 months: Evidence from 2002-2017 Indonesia Demographic and Health Surveys.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Healthcare-seeking behavior for children is crucial for reducing disease severity. Such behavior can improve child health outcomes and prevent child morbidity and mortality. The present study sought to analyze the determinants of mothers' engagement in healthcare-seeking behavior for children with common childhood diseases, focusing on mothers of children aged 0-59 months in Indonesia. METHODS: This cross-sectional study comprised a secondary data analysis using the 2002-2017 Indonesia Demographic and Health Survey (IDHS) databases. We included all women surveyed aged 15-49 years old who had children under five years of age. We weighted the univariate, bivariate, and multivariate logistic regression analysis of healthcare-seeking behavior for children aged 0-59 months. RESULTS: We analyzed data for 24,529 women whose children were under five years of age at the time of survey. Common diseases, such as diarrhea, fever, and acute respiratory infection (ARI) were the most frequently cited reasons for healthcare-seeking behavior. During 2002-2017, the proportion of mothers seeking healthcare for their children with diarrhea increased from 67.70% to 69.88%, that with fever increased from 61.48% to 71.64% and that ARI increased from 64.01% to 76.75%. Multivariate analysis revealed that child's age, child's birth order, mother's education, ability to meet expenses, distance to nearest healthcare facility, wealth index, place of residence, and region of residence, were significantly associated with healthcare-seeking behavior. CONCLUSION: Various individual and environmental-level factors influence healthcare-seeking behavior for childhood diseases. Available, accessible, and affordable health service facilities are recommended to assist socio-economically and geographically disadvantaged families.","Khasanah U, Efendi F, Has EMM, Adnani QES, Ramadhan K, Arna YD, Almutairi WM",PLoS One,2023,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
27853451,High Protective Efficacy of Probiotics and Rice Bran against Human Norovirus Infection and Diarrhea in Gnotobiotic Pigs.,"Probiotics have been recognized as vaccine adjuvants and therapeutic agents to treat acute gastroenteritis in children. We previously showed that rice bran (RB) reduced human rotavirus diarrhea in gnotobiotic pigs. Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are the major pathogens causing non-bacterial acute gastroenteritis worldwide. In this study, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) were first screened for their ability to bind HuNoV P particles and virions derived from clinical samples containing HuNoV genotype GII.3 and GII.4, then the effects of LGG+EcN and RB on HuNoV infection and diarrhea were investigated using the gnotobiotic pig model. While LGG+EcN colonization inhibited HuNoV shedding, probiotic cocktail regimens in which RB feeding started 7 days prior to or 1 day after viral inoculation in the LGG+EcN colonized gnotobiotic pigs exhibited high protection against HuNoV diarrhea and shedding, characterized by significantly reduced incidence (89 versus 20%) and shorter mean duration of diarrhea (2.2 versus 0.2 days), as well as shorter mean duration of virus shedding (3.2 versus 1.0 days). In both probiotic cocktail groups, the diarrhea reduction rates were 78% compared with the control group, and diarrhea severity was reduced as demonstrated by the significantly lower cumulative fecal scores. The high protective efficacy of the probiotic cocktail regimens was attributed to stimulation of IFN-gamma(+) T cell responses, increased production of intestinal IgA and IgG, and maintenance of healthy intestinal morphology (manifested as longer villi compared with the control group). Therefore, probiotic cocktail regimens containing LGG+EcN and RB may represent highly efficacious strategies to prevent and treat HuNoV gastroenteritis, and potentially other human enteric pathogens.","Lei S, Ramesh A, Twitchell E, Wen K, Bui T, Weiss M, Yang X, Kocher J, Li G, Giri-Rachman E, Trang NV, Jiang X, Ryan EP, Yuan L",Front Microbiol,2016,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
39996345,"How Sociodemographic, Water, and Sanitation Factors Influence Diarrhea in Children Under Five: Insights from Indonesia's Underdeveloped Regions.","BACKGROUND: Despite the decrease in prevalence from 18.5% in 2013 to 12.3% in 2018, diarrhea presents a major public health challenge in Indonesia which leads to significant mortality. This study investigated factors influencing diarrhea among children under five years of age in underdeveloped regions of Indonesia, where disparities from other regions are significant. Study Design: A cross-sectional study. METHODS: This study obtained data from National Basic Health Research conducted in 2018. Sixty underdeveloped regions of Indonesia, with a total of 9243 children aged 0-59 months, were included. Chi-square, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were conducted to determine factors influencing the prevalence of diarrhea in children under 5 years of age. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis revealed that the age categories of 12-23 months (OR: 1.73; 95% CI: 1.48, 2.02) and 24-35 months (OR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.53), awareness of a nearby hospital (OR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.63, 0.86), and history of acute respiratory infection (ARI) in the past month (OR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.66, 2.40) were associated with diarrhea in children under the age of five in underdeveloped regions of Indonesia. In contrast, the environmental factors analyzed further in the study were not significantly associated with the prevalence of diarrhea in children under five years of age in underdeveloped regions of Indonesia. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the child's age, the child's history of ARI, and household awareness of nearby hospitals are critical factors associated with the child's diarrhea in underdeveloped regions of Indonesia.","Simaremare SRS, Rachmat B, Nugraheni WP, Faisal DR, Nirwan M, Ipa M, Puspita T, Kurniasih DAA, Senewe FP",J Res Health Sci,2025 Jan 1,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
11985965,"Incidence of Norwalk-like viruses, rotavirus and adenovirus infection in patients with acute gastroenteritis in Jakarta, Indonesia.","Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs), rotavirus and adenovirus are reportedly responsible from 4 to 42% of non-bacterial acute sporadic gastroenteritis. The incidence of NLVs, adenovirus and rotavirus infections in Indonesia is unclear. A total of 402 symptomatic cases from Indonesian patients with acute gastroenteritis and 102 asymptomatic controls that tested negative for bacteria and parasites were screened for the presence of NLVs, rotavirus and adenovirus using the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Rotaclone kits and Adenoclone kits. Specific prototype probes were used to ascertain which NLV prototypes were present in the area. NLVs were detected in 45/218 (21%), rotavirus was detected in 170/402 (42%) and adenovirus was detected in 11/273 (4%) samples examined. Genetic analysis of the RT-PCR products using specific prototype probes for NLVs indicated that the prototypes were 42% Taunton agent and 58% Hawaii/Snow Mountain agent. Comparative data on patients showed that the incidence of rotavirus infections was two times greater than the NLVs infections, and that adenovirus infections were the least prevalent. All of the control samples tested were negative for NLVs and adenoviruses, however 8/70 (11%) of the samples were positive for rotaviruses. The high incidence of enteric viral-related infections is a threat among acute diarrheic patients in Jakarta, Indonesia.","Subekti D, Lesmana M, Tjaniadi P, Safari N, Frazier E, Simanjuntak C, Komalarini S, Taslim J, Campbell JR, Oyofo BA",FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol,2002 Mar 25,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia

37727411,Effect of applying the health promotion model in stunting prevention and behavior control in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Stunting is a condition of failure to thrive in children, due to chronic malnutrition and recurrent infections. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of implementing the health promotion model in stunting prevention and control behavior. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional quantitative analytic study was conducted using a survey method involving 228 mothers of stunted children in Indonesia. Cluster random sampling was used. Data were collected using a questionnaire with a Likert scale, and then, they were analyzed using univariate analysis, multiple linear regression, and pathway analysis to determine the direct and indirect effects. RESULTS: All respondents were of non-risk age (20-45 years), most had height >150 cm (83.8%), moderate weight (93.4%), multigravida parity (87.3%), middle education (70.2%), unemployed (91.7%), monthly income of less than 1,800,000 rupiahs (89.9%), and exclusive breastfeeding (97.4%). Sanitation, self-efficacy, and social support had a significant effect on stunting prevention and control behavior (P < 0.05). Socioeconomic and sanitation effects through self-efficacy indirectly had a significant positive, while parenting through food or nutritional intake had a significant influence on the stunting incidence (P < 0.05). Variables that had a significant positive effect on stunting prevention and behavior directly were perceived vulnerability, perceived severity, perceived obstacles, self-efficacy, social support, community organizing, and facilitator (P < 0.05). Parenting through the health of diarrhea or acute respiratory infection (ARI) had no significant positive effect on the stunting incidence (P = 0.121). CONCLUSION: Almost all variables have a significant direct and indirect effect on stunting prevention and control behavior, as well as the stunting incidence, except parenting through the health of diarrhea or ARI.","Soviyati E, Sulaeman ES, Sugihardjo I, Wiboworini B",J Educ Health Promot,2023,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
32740950,Randomized Controlled Trial on the Effect of Partially Hydrolyzed Guar Gum Supplementation on Diarrhea Frequency and Gut Microbiome Count Among Pelvic Radiation Patients.,"BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy is the treatment of pelvic cancers, with diarrhea often being the most frequent acute side effect. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) usage in reducing radiotherapy-induced diarrhea and improving bacterial count, nutrition status, and quality of life (QoL) among cancer patients. METHODS: Adult patients undergoing pelvic radiation were recruited and randomly assigned to receive supplementation of either 10 g of PHGG or placebo (maltodextrin) twice daily, 14 days prior and 14 days during pelvic radiation. Diarrhea frequency, fecal samples, nutrition status, and QoL were assessed at baseline and days 14, 28 (2 weeks after pelvic radiation), and 45 (at the completion of pelvic radiation, 2 weeks' postsupplementation). RESULTS: A total of 30 patients (mean age 56.5 +/- 10.8 years, 75% malnourished) participated. The mean of diarrhea frequency in the intervention group (IG) was higher compared with the control group (CG) from days 14 and 28 but reduced at day 45. There was a significant intervention effect after controlling for confounders (ie, baseline diarrhea, age, nutrition status) (P < .05). Bifidobacterium count increased by double among the IG at 14 days of PHGG supplementation, whereas such trend was not observed in the CG. CONCLUSION: Supplementation of PHGG potentially increased the bifidobacterial count and seemed to have post-supplementation effects by reducing the frequency of diarrhea upon the completion of pelvic radiation treatment.","Rosli D, Shahar S, Manaf ZA, Lau HJ, Yusof NYM, Haron MR, Majid HA",JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr,2021 Feb,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
37986567,Risk factors of prolonged diarrhea in children under 2 years old.,"BACKGROUND: Prolonged diarrhea, defined as diarrhea lasting longer than 7 days, is known to negatively impact children's growth and development. However, studies of the risk factors of prolonged diarrhea remain limited. PURPOSE: This study aimed to analyze the risk factors for prolonged diarrhea in children under 2 years of age with acute diarrhea. METHODS: This 1-year nested case-control study was conducted at Fatmawati General Hospital in 2021-2022. Participants were selected using a consecutive sampling method from among children under 2 years of age with acute diarrhea within the previous 2-4 days. Children with diarrhea that lasted 7 days were considered positive for prolonged diarrhea, whereas those with acute diarrhea were considered negative. Children with comorbidities such as malnutrition were excluded. Clinical information including age, breastfeeding history, antibiotic exposure history, and nutritional status was recorded. Complete blood count, blood zinc levels, Rotavirus, adenovirus, and norovirus serology, alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) levels, and stool analysis were acquired as laboratory data. RESULTS: There were 62 subjects in the study and control groups. Overall, the median age was 12 months (6-24 months); most patients were boys. A history of antibiotic use (odds ratio [OR], 15.860; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.286-47.591; P<0.001), zinc deficiency (OR, 4.758; 95% CI, 1.711-13.229; P=0.003), and elevated fecal AAT levels (OR, 2.677; 95% CI, 1.046-6.850; P=0.040) were the main risk factors for prolonged diarrhea in children under 2 years of age with acute diarrhea. CONCLUSION: A history of antibiotic use, zinc deficiency, and elevated fecal AAT levels were the main risk factors for prolonged diarrhea in children under 2 years of age with acute diarrhea. Thorough testing and appropriate antibiotic use are required to prevent prolonged diarrhea in children under 2 years of age.","Rahmat D, Firmansyah A, Timan IS, Bardosono S, Prihartono J, Gayatri P",Clin Exp Pediatr,2023 Dec,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
14522513,"Prevalence of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) in hospitalized acute diarrhea patients in Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia.","The relationship between enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and hospitalized patients with acute diarrhea was examined in a study conducted in two hospitals from June 2000 to May 2001 in Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia. A total of 489 hospitalized patients with acute diarrhea were enrolled, and their rectal swabs were screened for enteric bacterial pathogens. Toxins, colonization factor antigens (CFAs), in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility and seasonal distribution patterns associated with ETEC were ascertained. The diagnosis of ETEC infection and CFAs association were performed with GM-1 ELISA and Dot blot immunoassays. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli was isolated from the rectal swabs of 14.9% of the patients. The distribution of toxins among the ETEC strains found was ST in 51 (69.9%), while LT and ST/LT were found in 28.8% and 1.3% respectively. The highest isolation rate for ETEC was found among children between the ages of 1 and 15 years. Colonization factor antigens were identified in 28.8% of the ETEC strains. A high prevalence of CFA was found among the rectal swabs of patients with ST isolates. High frequency of resistance to ampicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and cephalothin was displayed among the ETEC strains. All ETEC strains were susceptible to norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid.

29866618,Diarrhea among hospitalized children under five: A call for inclusion of rotavirus vaccine to the national immunization program in Indonesia.,"CONTEXT: Rotavirus diarrhea is a common disease worldwide which mostly affects children under five years old. Rotavirus infection causes severe diarrhea and leads to substantial health care costs. In Indonesia the rotavirus vaccine has been available since 2011, however it has not been included into the National Immunization Program. This study aims to describe the proportion of rotavirus in children under 5 in Indonesia, the clinical characteristics of rotavirus infections, and the rotavirus strains circulating in the country during 2010-2015. METHODS: Children under five years of age with acute watery diarrhea were prospectively identified and enrolled through the active diarrhea surveillance system in 5 sites in four provinces in Indonesia during 2010-2015. The rotavirus specimens were tested using Enzyme Immunoassay. Bivariate logistic regression tests were performed to compare rotavirus positive and negative results with respect to the collected demographic and clinical variables. RESULTS: From January 2010 to December 2015, the average annual rotavirus prevalence among children hospitalized with acute watery diarrhea in four provinces in Indonesia was 47.5%. Rotavirus diarrhea occurred mostly in children under 2 years of age. Of all age groups, children aged 6-11 and 12-23 months had the highest prevalence of rotavirus diarrhea in all years (54.2% and 50.6%, respectively). This study found that the most prevalent of G and P genotypes were G1P8 in 2010 (63.2%), 2011 (64.1%) and 2012 (74.6%) and G3P8 in 2013 (49.7%), 2014 (82.5%) and 2015 (84.4%) CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that rotavirus is a major cause of diarrhea in hospitalized children in Indonesia. These findings highlight the need for inclusion of the rotavirus vaccine to the National Immunization Program in Indonesia.","Mulyani NS, Prasetyo D, Karyana IPG, Sukardi W, Damayanti W, Anggraini D, Palupi-Baroto R, Nirwati H, Wahab A, Mulyadi AWE, Nakamura T, Soenarto Y",Vaccine,2018 Dec 14,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
36636306,"Genotype Profiles of Rotavirus Strains in Children under 5-year-old Outpatients with Diarrhea in Bandung, West Java, Indonesia.","INTRODUCTION: Diarrhea is a global leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children under five, with rotaviruses being the most common cause. This study aimed to determine the genotypes of rotavirus in children under 5 years with diarrhea in Bandung, Indonesia. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from 2014 to 2018 on 450 children under five with acute diarrhea in primary health centers in Bandung, Indonesia. Fecal samples were examined for rotavirus antigen using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method, and genotype was determined through sequencing using polymerase chain reaction. Results were statistically analyzed using Pearson Chi-square in Epi Info version 3.5.4, with P < 0.05 considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Rotavirus was identified in 8.9% of the subjects, slightly higher in boys (n = 24, 9.8%) than girls (n = 16, 7.8%). We found that the most rotavirus positive in age group is >12-24 months and >24-59 months, while the highest percentage is at the age of </=6 months (11.8%). Moderate malnutrition was observed in more subjects (12.8%). Vomiting was more frequent in patients positive (55%, P = 0.013) and fever was seen in 32.5% (P = 0.645). No signs of dehydration were seen in most subjects (75%), P = 0.227.

8586781,Composition and preliminary evaluation of a hydrolyzed rice-based oral rehydration solution for the treatment of acute diarrhea in children.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to experimentally develop and clinically evaluate the safety and potential usefulness of a rice-based, short glucose polymer oral rehydration solution (ORS), Amylyte, in the treatment of acute diarrhea. Amylyte has a similar osmolality but a higher caloric density than the WHO ORS. METHODS: Different amounts of rice were cooked in 500 ml of water containing salts (1.5 g NaCl, 600 mg KCl, and 150 mg CaCl2) with varying amounts of thermophilic amylase (252,500 modified Wohlgemuth units). Amylase (25 mg) thinned the gluey rice water when 100 g of rice was cooked in 500 ml of water for 10 minutes. The volume of the resultant supernatant (Amylyte) was approximately 250 ml. A two-part, clinical case study was performed. In study 1, 12 children with diarrhea and mild dehydration were studied to determine the safety of Amylyte. In study 2, Amylyte and the WHO ORS were given to 24 and 31 male children with acute diarrhea and moderate to severe dehydration, respectively. RESULTS: 92-96% of the rice amylose and amylopectin were converted to short polymers of glucose (3-9 molecules of glucose). The osmolality of 7,994 packages used to make the Amylyte solution ranged between 277-340 mOsm/kg. The mean electrolyte composition was Na+ = 68 mEq/L, K+ = 20 mEq/L, Cl = 73 mEq/L, the caloric density 425 kcal/L and rice proteins 0.7 g/L. In study 1, 12 children with diarrhea and mild dehydration were rehydrated successfully with Amylyte ORS and the diarrhea ceased within 48 hours. None developed clinical features of carbohydrate intolerance. In study 2, an open-label clinical case study, children with acute diarrhea given Amylyte ORS had significantly less stool output than children given the WHO ORS. CONCLUSIONS: Amylyte ORS has the advantages of a higher caloric density than the WHO ORS and shares a simple preparation of appropriate osmolality and electrolyte composition. It can safely and effectively rehydrate children with acute diarrhea and dehydration.","Lebenthal E, Khin-Maung-U, Rolston DD, Melman S, Jirapinyo P, Shin K, Takita H, Firmansyah A, Ismail R, Bakri A, et al.",J Am Coll Nutr,1995 Jun,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
8632216,Vitamin A supplementation fails to reduce incidence of acute respiratory illness and diarrhea in preschool-age Indonesian children.,"Vitamin A supplementation of populations of vitamin A-deficient preschool-age children has been shown to reduce childhood mortality, but the primary preventive effects of such supplements on childhood infectious diseases have not been carefully evaluated. We conducted an individually randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked trial among 1,407 Indonesian preschool-age children, to measure the effects of high dose vitamin A on acute respiratory and diarrheal illnesses. Signs and symptoms of morbidity were monitored using every other day home surveillance by trained interviewers. High dose vitamin A supplements increased the incidence of acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) by 8%, and acute lower respiratory illnesses (ALRI) by 39%. These detrimental effects on acute lower respiratory illnesses were most marked in children with adequate nutritional status (rate ratio 1.83, 95% confidence interval 1.257-2.669). In contrast, vitamin A tended to be protective of ALRI in chronically malnourished children (rate ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.375-1.331). There was no overall effect of high-dose vitamin A supplements on the incidence of diarrheal disease (rate ratio 1.06, 95% confidence interval 0.920-1.225). However, we found a significant interaction between supplementation and age: vitamin A increased the incidence of diarrhea in children < 30 mo of age, but tended to reduce the incidence in older children. The finding of a significant adverse effect of vitamin A supplements in adequately nourished children highlights the need to review the criteria for selecting populations of preschool-age children for vitamin A supplementation.","Dibley MJ, Sadjimin T, Kjolhede CL, Moulton LH",J Nutr,1996 Feb,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia

METHODS: A prospective randomized double blind placebo-controlled trial was performed to test the efficacy of a probiotic food supplement in 112 children in the Kenari subdistrict, central Jakarta, aged 6-36 mo with acute infectious diarrhea and moderate dehydration. The supplemented group was given standard therapy (oral rehydration solution and zinc) and the probiotic strains Lactobacillus (L.) rhamnosus R0011 1.9 x 10(9) colony forming units (cfu) and L. acidophilus R0052 0.1 x 10(9) cfu/d for 7 d, while the control group was given standard therapy and placebo. RESULTS: Median duration of diarrhea was 68.5 h (range 13-165) in the supplemented and 61.5 h (range 21-166) in the control group (P = 0.596). Median daily frequency of defecation until diarrhea stopped was 5.0 in the supplemented vs. 5.5 in the control group (P = 0.795).

30729772,Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) as determinant and environment as modulator of infant mortality and morbidity: the Tanjungsari Cohort Study in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) is related to mortality and morbidity. However, defining IUGR by suitable field methods remains a challenge. A maternal-child Risk-Approach- Strategy (during 1988-1989) and follow-on Tanjungsari Cohort Study (TCS) (1989-1990), aimed to generate a practical classification of IUGR and explore its usage in predicting growth, mortality and morbidity of infants in the cohort. STUDY DESIGN: Some 3892 singleton live-birth infants were followed. IUGR was defined by birth weight (BW) and length (BL) classified as: acute, chronic, non-IUGR or 'probably preterm'. Growth, mortality, and survival curve were calculated to prove that the classification identified the most vulnerable infants. Fever >3 days and diarrhoea were assessed based on IUGR classification, sex, exclusive breastfeeding, and environmental factors. RESULTS: IUGR infant weight and length did not catch-up with the non-IUGR in the first year. Infant mortality rate was 44.7 per 1000 where some 61% died within 90 days. Using age specific mortality by BW, 23.6% of all deaths occurred when it was <2500 g compared to 66.2% from IUGR and preterm groups. Fever and diarrhoea rates increased over 12 months. Diarrhoea was associated with poor source-of-drinking-water and latrine. CONCLUSION: The IUGR classification predicted one-year growth curves and survival, besides age and sex. IUGR based on BW and BL identified a larger group of at-risk infants than did low BW. High morbidity rates were partly explained by poor environmental conditions. IUGR inclusive of BL has value in optimizing nutritional status in the first 1000 days of life.","Alisjahbana B, Rivami DS, Octavia L, Susilawati N, Pangaribuan M, Alisjahbana A, Diana A",Asia Pac J Clin Nutr,2019,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
30512613,[Cholera].,"Cholera. Cholera is caused by Vibrio cholerae, a Gram-negative bacteria. Some strains can synthesize an enterotoxin - the cholera toxin - which is responsible for the disease. Cholera has already caused seven pandemics since the beginning of the 19th century; the seventh started from Indonesia in 1961 and was provoked by the emergence of an epidemic clone, V. cholerae O1 El Tor. Most cases occure in South Asia, Africa, Haiti and most recently Yemen. Contamination is by ingestion, due to close contact with a patient, or by contaminated water and food. Patients present with acute watery diarrhea and vomiting as a result of the toxin-induced fluid intestinal leakage. The severity of dehydration determines the prognosis, which can be fatal in a few hours if intense rehydration is not started immediately. Prevention is based on universal access to water, sanitation and hand hygiene. An oral vaccine can help prevent or control epidemics.","Piarroux R, Rebaudet S",Rev Prat,2017 Dec,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia

He had a normal white cell count of 8x10;9/L and elevated c-reactive protein (CRP) of 205 mg/L with normal liver function tests. Originally thought to be appendicitis, given the rarity of cholecystitis in a child, he was commenced on broad-spectrum antibiotics and was taken to the operating theatre based on his clinical presentation. Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed inflammatory change in both the gallbladder and appendix and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy and appendicectomy were performed simultaneously. Histopathology results confirmed cholecystitis and appendicitis and a stool culture confirmed the presence of Salmonella serotype B. Synchronous cholecystitis and appendicitis is an exceedingly rare phenomenon with only a handful of cases reported in the literature. This is the first case in the literature of this phenomenon occurring in the paediatric population; surgeons need to be aware of this rare possibility even in the paediatric population and especially in those patients with an atypical presentation or in recent travellers experiencing gastroenteritis.","Joseph CT, Tsang CLN, Goltsman D, Garibotto NL, Mekisic A",Cureus,2020 Mar 8,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia

Percentage of common responses (PCR) described similarity of perceived scopes of practice for pharmacists and pharmacy technicians. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified associations of scopes of practice with pharmacy characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 185 pharmacists and 142 pharmacy technicians participated. Pharmacy technicians performed minor ailment consultations, however, if considered beyond their scope of practice, they referred the patient to the pharmacist (T=120/142, 84.5%). Vaginal thrush, bacterial conjunctivitis, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and acute pain were minor ailments perceived only within a pharmacist's scope (PCR above 60%). Of 34 minor ailments, 11 showed PCR values between 40-60% overlapping pharmacists and pharmacy technicians perceived scopes of practice (allergy/rash, back pain, cold sores, dermatitis, diarrhoea, eczema, hayfever, haemorrhoids, rheumatism, sore throat, and superficial wounds). Back pain, cold sores, dermatitis, and sore throat associated pharmacists' scope of practice with years of practice experience (p-value<0.05). Pharmacy technicians perceived their scopes of practice to be wider than perceived by pharmacists. CONCLUSIONS: Discordance between pharmacists' and pharmacy technicians' perceived scopes of minor ailments management highlights the need for clearly defined scopes of practice for each professional group. Each professional group must practise within their competence to ensure safe pharmacy practices.","Mizranita V, Sim TF, Sunderland B, Parsons R, Hughes JD",Pharm Pract (Granada),2021 Apr-Jun,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
33680579,High prevalence of circulating DS-1-like human rotavirus A and genotype diversity in children with acute gastroenteritis in Thailand from 2016 to 2019.,"BACKGROUND: Human rotavirus A (RVA) infection is the primary cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in infants and young children worldwide, especially in children under 5 years of age and is a major public health problem causing severe diarrhea in children in Thailand. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence, genotype diversity, and molecular characterization of rotavirus infection circulating in children under 15 years of age diagnosed with AGE in Thailand from January 2016 to December 2019. METHODS: A total of 2,001 stool samples were collected from children with gastroenteritis (neonates to children <15 years of age) and tested for RVA by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Amplified products were sequenced and submitted to an online genotyping tool for analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 301 (15.0%) stool samples were positive for RVA. RVA occurred most frequently among children aged 0-24 months. The seasonal incidence of rotavirus infection occurred typically in Thailand during the winter months (December-March). The G3P[8] genotype was identified as the most prevalent genotype (33.2%, 100/301), followed by G8P[8] (10.6%, 32/301), G9P[8] (6.3%, 19/301), G2P[4] (6.0%, 18/301), and G1P[6] (5.3%, 16/301). Uncommon G and P combinations such as G9P[4], G2P[8], G3P[4] and G3P[9] were also detected at low frequencies. In terms of genetic backbone, the unusual DS-1-like G3P[8] was the most frequently detected (28.2%, 85/301), and the phylogenetic analysis demonstrated high nucleotide identity with unusual DS-1-like G3P[8] detected in Thailand and several countries. CONCLUSIONS: A genetic association between RVA isolates from Thailand and other countries ought to be investigated given the local and global dissemination of rotavirus as it is crucial for controlling viral gastroenteritis, and implications for the national vaccination programs.","Pasittungkul S, Lestari FB, Puenpa J, Chuchaona W, Posuwan N, Chansaenroj J, Mauleekoonphairoj J, Sudhinaraset N, Wanlapakorn N, Poovorawan Y",PeerJ,2021,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
18425689,"Prevalence of Giardia lamblia with or without diarrhea in South East, South East Asia and the Far East.","This article is a review of the latest information on the prevalence of G. lamblia in South Asia, South East Asia and Far East, characterizing the current endemic situation within these regions. Around 33 published papers from 2002-2007 were collected on G. lamblia. The included countries were Nepal, Bangladesh, India, Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Republic of Korea, and China. Only five published papers were discarded because data was extracted before 2002-2007 or they are not included within our regions, emphasizing more on G. lamblia in animals, or performed at extensive molecular level. The prevalence of G. lamblia varied markedly between studies illustrating higher levels in the urban than in the rural areas, more among poor communities, slightly higher in males than in females with age range of 2-5-year-old children, and among university students, old-aged people, HIV-positive patients, and gastric carcinoma patients. Though G. lamblia is not a life-threatening parasite, nevertheless, it is still considered as the most common water-borne diarrhea-causing disease. It is important to understand the etiology, frequency, and consequences of acute diarrhea in children. Routine surveillance such as bi-annual follow-up treatments, treating G. duodenalis cysts and other protozoa oocysts detected in ground water sources, and continuous health education are the most preventive measures.","Dib HH, Lu SQ, Wen SF",Parasitol Res,2008 Jul,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
22488052,"Prevalence and molecular characterization of Vibrio cholerae from ice and beverages sold in Jakarta, Indonesia, using most probable number and multiplex PCR.","Vibrio cholerae is well recognized as the causative agent of cholera, an acute intestinal infection characterized by watery diarrhea that may lead to dehydration and death in some cases. V. cholerae is a natural inhabitant of the aquatic environment in the tropical regions. Jakarta has the highest percentage of individuals affected by sporadic diarrheal illness compared with other areas in Indonesia. Inadequate safety measures for drinking water supplies, improper sanitation, and poor hygiene can increase the risk of cholera outbreaks. Few studies have been conducted on the prevalence of these bacteria in ice and beverages that are popularly sold and consumed in Jakarta. In this study, we detected and quantified V. cholerae from ice and beverages collected from several areas in five regions of Jakarta. Levels of V. cholerae in both ice and beverages were determined with the three-tube most-probable-number (MPN) method and ranged from < 0.3 to > 110 MPN/ml. The presence of regulatory and virulence gene sequences was determined by using uniplex and multiplex PCR assays. Of 110 samples tested, 33 (30%) were positive for V. cholerae; 21 (64%) were ice samples and the remaining 12 (36%) were beverages. A total of 88 V. cholerae strains were isolated, based on the presence of the toxR gene sequence identified by PCR. Other genetic markers, such as hlyA (59%), ompU (16%), and ctxA (19%), also were found during the search for potential pathogenic strains. The detection and isolation of potentially harmful V. cholerae from ice and beverages in Jakarta indicate that these products pose a health risk from choleragenic vibrios, particularly because of the emergence of classical biotypes of V. cholerae O1 and potentially harmful non-O1 serovars of this species.","Waturangi DE, Pradita N, Linarta J, Banerjee S",J Food Prot,2012 Apr,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
30515279,"Complementary feeding practices and nutritional status of children 6-23 months old: formative study in Aceh, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The 6-23 months for infants is the longest period in the ""first 1,000 days"" of life. This period is very important for child development, so complementary feeding (CF) practices should be optimized to maximize children's potential for growth and development. The aim of this study was to analyze the CF practices and nutritional status of children aged 6-23 months. SUBJECTS/METHODS: For this cross-sectional study, 392 children aged 6-23 months were selected using stratified random sampling. Socio-demographic data were collected through interviews. CF practices, collected by interviews and repeated 24-hour food recall method, were the timely introduction of CF, minimum meal frequency, dietary diversity and minimum acceptable diet, consumption food rich in proteins and vitamin A. Nutritional status was assessed using the indicators of underweight, wasting and stunting. To analyze the association between socio-demographic indicators and CF with nutritional status, the chi-square test with a confidence interval of 95% was used. RESULTS: Results showed that 39% were exclusively breastfed, only 61% received prolonged breastfeeding and 50% received timely introduction of CF. Minimum meal frequency was met by 74% of subjects, but dietary diversity and minimum acceptable diet were only realized in 50% and 40% of the children, respectively. The prevalence of underweight, wasting, and stunting were 26%, 23%, and 28%, respectively. Age of the child, birth order, birth weight, parents' education level, family size and incidence of fever and diarrhea during the previous two weeks were associated with underweight, while child's birth order, fathers' education level, mother's age, family size, completion of the age-appropriate vaccination and fish consumption frequency were associated with wasting. Age of the child, incidence of fever and acute respiratory infection, and fortified food consumption were associated with stunting. CONCLUSIONS: Suboptimal CF practices and high prevalence of underweight, wasting and stunting were found among children aged 6-23 months old in Aceh. These results highlight the need to improve CF and nutritional status.","Ahmad A, Madanijah S, Dwiriani CM, Kolopaking R",Nutr Res Pract,2018 Dec,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia

12493168,Surveillance of bacterial pathogens of diarrhea disease in Indonesia.,"Emerging or reemerging infections due to bacterial disease may be a local, regional or global problem. Bacterial acute gastroenteritis is a potential cause of substantial morbidity in travelers and deployed U.S. military personnel. A surveillance study was conducted over a two-year period in Indonesia among 6760 patients with debilitating diarrheal diseases. Of the 6,760 patients, 587 (9%) of the patient stools were positive for bacteria. The proportions of bacteria isolated from the 587 patients were: Shigella flexneri (39%), Salmonella spp. (26%), Vibrio spp. (17%), S. sonnei (7%), Campylobacter jejuni (4.4%), Salmonella typhi (3%) and S. dysenteriae (2.3%). Shigella flexneri was the most prevalent pathogen isolated, over Vibrio spp. No V. cholerae was isolated in the cities of Pontianak, Padang or Batam in Indonesia. Shigella dysenteriae reemergence was noted in Bali, Kalimantan, Batam and Jakarta after an absence of 15 years. Isolation of a high proportion of S. flexneri, and Vibrio spp. occurred during the rainy months. All bacterial isolates were susceptible to quinolones, with the exception of C. jejuni and Salmonella spp., which were resistant to ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and nalidixic acid. Our findings highlight the decline of V. cholerae, the rise of S. flexneri and the reemergence of S. dysenteriae in Indonesia.

32174722,"Detections of gastrointestinal parasites, including Giardia intestinalis and Cryptosporidium spp., in cattle of Banten province, Indonesia.","Gastrointestinal parasites can induce low productivity in livestock by causing acute or chronic enteritis. Veterinarians make great efforts to design rational and effective hygienic protocols for both the prevention and treatment of diarrhea. Although prevalences can vary depending on the examined areas or the ages of the hosts, and the methods used for detections, it is helpful to accumulate data across many areas to evaluate parasitic distribution. A coprological survey in cattle was conducted in Tangerang, Banten Province of Indonesia, in order to determine the prevalence of the parasites, including those of diarrhea-associated diseases. Furthermore, the risk of transmission of Giardia intestinalis and Cryptosporidium spp. to human was genetically analyzed. Gastrointestinal parasites were detected in 87 of 109 cattle samples, including 85 carrying Eimeria spp., 36 carrying Fasciola gigantica, 35 carrying Strongyloides spp., 33 carrying Paramphistomum spp., and 15 carrying Capillaria spp. Giardia intestinalis and Cryptosporidium spp., parasites with zoonotic potential, were detected in 9 and 1 cattle samples, respectively. Molecular analyses identified the G. intestinalis isolate as a member of Assemblage E, which has been recently detected in humans in another country. These results may be helpful in understanding the hygienic risk affecting the livestock productivity and zoonotic potential of cattle in Indonesia.","Sawitri DH, Wardhana AH, Martindah E, Ekawasti F, Dewi DA, Utomo BN, Shibahara T, Kusumoto M, Tokoro M, Sasai K, Matsubayashi M",J Parasit Dis,2020 Mar,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
34758472,A Questionnaire-Based Survey on the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Gastrointestinal Endoscopy in Asia.,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 outbreak abruptly restricted gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy services during the first wave of the pandemic. We aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the practice of GI endoscopy in Asian countries. METHODS: This was an International Questionnaire-based Internet Survey conducted at multiple facilities by the International Gastrointestinal Consensus Symposium. A total of 166 respondents in Japan, China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, and Singapore participated in this study. RESULTS: The volume of endoscopic screening or follow-up endoscopies and therapeutic endoscopies were markedly reduced during the first wave of the pandemic, which was mainly attributed to the decreased number of outpatients, cancellations by patients, and adherence to the guidelines of academic societies. The most common indications for GI endoscopy during the first wave were GI bleeding, cholangitis or obstructive jaundice, and a highly suspicious case of neoplasia. The most common GI symptoms of COVID-19 patients during the infected period included diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. The pandemic exacerbated some GI diseases, such as functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome. There were cases with delayed diagnosis of cancers due to postponed endoscopic procedures, and the prescription of proton pump inhibitors/potassium-competitive acid blockers, steroids, immunosuppressive agents, and biologics was delayed or canceled. The personal protective equipment used during endoscopic procedures for high-risk patients were disposable gloves, disposable gowns, N95 or equivalent masks, and face shields. However, the devices on the patient side during endoscopic procedures included modified surgical masks, mouthpieces with filters, and disposable vinyl boxes or aerosol boxes covering the head. Furthermore, the time for education, basic research, clinical research, and daily clinical practice decreased during the first wave. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic profoundly affected the method of performing GI endoscopy and medical treatment for patients with GI diseases in Asian countries.","Otani K, Watanabe T, Higashimori A, Suzuki H, Kamiya T, Shiotani A, Sugimoto M, Nagahara A, Fukudo S, Motoya S, Yamaguchi S, Zhu Q, Chan FKL, Hahm KB, Tablante MC, Prachayakul V, Abdullah M, Ang TL, Murakami K",Digestion,2022,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
34118685,Implications of household tobacco and alcohol use on child health and women's welfare in six low and middle-income countries: An analysis from a gender perspective.,"OBJECTIVE: To study the implications of household tobacco and alcohol use on child health and women's welfare using a gender lens in Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Jordan, Kenya, and Nigeria with varied geographical and cultural characteristics in the pattern of tobacco and alcohol use. METHODS: We identified child health and women's welfare outcomes that may be impacted by tobacco and alcohol use, with a focus on the crowding-out effects on household resource allocation. For child health indicators, we focussed on engagement in preventative care, nutrition, and responses to acute illness. For women, we focused on access to resources for health-seeking and intimate partner violence (IPV). We used logistic regression to determine the association between household gender tobacco and/or alcohol use on child health and women's welfare, using data from six nationally-representative Demographic and Health Surveys, with each having a sample size of 5000-30,000 households and conducted after 2010. RESULTS: Children in households where men and women use tobacco are significantly less likely to receive the full schedule of Diphtheria-Pertussis-Tetanus (DPT) vaccine in India, Indonesia, and Jordan (Odds ratio or OR; OR(India) = 0.67, p < 0.001; OR(Indonesia) = 0.55, p = 0.028; OR(Jordan) = 0.45, p = 0.048), and all basic vaccinations as well as receive appropriate treatment for fever/diarrhoea in India and Indonesia (all basic vaccinations: OR(India) = 0.78, p < 0.001, OR(Indonesia) = 0.43, p = 0.009; treatment for fever/diarrhoea: OR(India) = 0.65, p < 0.001; OR(Indonesia) = 0.50, p = 0.038). In most countries, women are significantly more likely to experience IPV when their husband/partner uses tobacco and/or alcohol. CONCLUSIONS: Across a diverse set of countries with varied cultural characteristics which affect the uptake and use of tobacco and alcohol, tobacco and alcohol use are associated with crowding-out of acute and preventative health-related behaviours and crowding-in of harmful behaviours. This has significant implications for tobacco and alcohol control programmes, and positions tobacco and alcohol control as central to human capital initiatives and in achieving health for all.","Wu DC, Shannon G, Reynales-Shigematsu LM, Saenz de Miera B, Llorente B, Jha P",Soc Sci Med,2021 Jul,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
6659051,"Bacteria, parasitic agents and rotaviruses associated with acute diarrhoea in hospital in-patient Indonesian children.","Faeces from children (aged from one month to 12 years) with acute diarrhoea admitted to hospital in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, from June 1978 to June 1979, were examined for the presence of enteric pathogens. One or more recognized enteropathogens were identified in 56% of children. Rotaviruses were identified in 38% of all children. Toxigenic coliforms (predominantly Escherichia coli) were isolated from 12% of children. Salmonella sp. (6%), Shigella sp. (4%) and enteropathogenic parasites (predominantly Trichuris trichiura) from 3.5% of children. Mixed infections with two or more enteric pathogens were found in 7.6% of children. The incidence rate of each pathogen was correlated with age of the child, socio-economic level of the family and duration of breast feeding. Toxigenic coliforms were equally common in all age groups from both well-to-do and poor families. Enteropathogenic parasites appeared in increasing frequency with age. They were more common in artificially fed children and in children from families of low socio-economic level. The occurrence of multiple infection with mixtures of enteric pathogens increased with increasing age. Mixtures of parasites and other enteric pathogens only occurred in children with acute diarrhoea. These results provide baseline data about the relative importance of different enteropathogens in Indonesian children.","Soenarto Y, Sebodo T, Suryantoro P, Krisnomurti, Haksohusodo S, Ilyas, Kusniyo, Ristanto, Romas MA, Noerhajati, et al.",Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,1983,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia

The most common complications and cause of deaths were bronchopneumonia (94.4%), encephalopathy (88.9%) and diarrhea (25.9%) or combinations thereof. The outcome of measles infections is determined by the presence of malnutrition and complications which is influenced by the nutritional intake, exposure, susceptibility and constitution of the patients. The household characteristics (socio-economic, socio-cultural and health facilities available) influence the above mentioned interactions through intermediate variables of nutrition (feeding pattern, food supplements), constitution, age) and treatment.

Here we performed a molecular epidemiological analysis of RVA infection among pediatric patients in East Java, Indonesia, during 2015-2018. A total of 432 stool samples were collected from hospitalized pediatric patients with acute gastroenteritis. None of the patients in this cohort had been immunized with an RVA vaccine. The overall prevalence of RVA infection was 31.7% (137/432), and RVA infection was significantly more prevalent in the 6- to 11-month age group than in the other age groups (P < 0.05). Multiplex reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) revealed that the most common G-P combination was equine-like G3P[8] (70.8%), followed by equine-like G3P[6] (12.4%), human G1P[8] (8.8%), G3P[6] (1.5%), and G1P[6] (0.7%). Interestingly, the equine-like strains were exclusively detected until May 2017, but in July 2017 they were completely replaced by a typical human genotype (G1 and G3), suggesting that the dynamic changes in RVA genotypes from equine-like G3 to typical human G1/G3 in Indonesia can occur even in the country with low RVA vaccine coverage rate. The mechanism of the dynamic changes in RVA genotypes needs to be explored. Infants and children with RVA-associated gastroenteritis presented more frequently with some dehydration, vomiting, and watery diarrhea, indicating a greater severity of RVA infection compared to those with non-RVA gastroenteritis. In conclusion, a dynamic change was found in the RVA genotype from equine-like G3 to a typical human genotype. Since severe cases of RVA infection were prevalent, especially in children aged 6 to 11 months or more generally in those less than 2 years old, RVA vaccination should be included in Indonesia's national immunization program.","Athiyyah AF, Utsumi T, Wahyuni RM, Dinana Z, Yamani LN, Soetjipto, Sudarmo SM, Ranuh RG, Darma A, Juniastuti, Raharjo D, Matsui C, Deng L, Abe T, Doan YH, Fujii Y, Shimizu H, Katayama K, Lusida MI, Shoji I",Front Microbiol,2019,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
37321576,Inferior vena cava to aorta ratio in dehydrated pediatric patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Dehydration due to acute diarrhea is among the leading causes of mortality. However, advancements in management and technology do not help clinicians differentiate dehydration degrees. Ultrasound using the inferior vena cava to aorta (IVC/ Ao) ratio is a promising noninvasive technique to identify significant pediatric dehydration. PUSPOSE: Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the diagnostic parameters of the IVC/Ao ratio for predicting clinically significant dehydration in pediatric patients. METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases for studies of pediatric patients (</=18 years old) who presented with signs and symptoms of dehydration due to acute diarrhea, gastroenteritis, or vomiting. The inclusion criteria were cross-sectional, case-control, cohort, and randomized controlled trial study design and publication in any language. We then conducted a meta-analysis using the midas and metandi commands from Stata software. RESULTS: Five studies of 461 patients were included. The combined sensitivity was 86% (95% confidence interval [CI], 79%-91%), while the specificity was 73% (95% CI, 59%-84%). The area under the curve was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.86-0.91). The positive likelihood ratio (LR+) was 3.2 (95% CI, 2.1-5.1) with a 76% posttest probability, while the negative likelihood ratio (LR-) was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.12-0.28) with a 16% posttest probability. The combined negative predictive value was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.75-0.91), while the positive predictive value was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.68-0.82). CONCLUSION: The IVC/Ao ratio was insufficient to exclude or confirm significant dehydration in pediatric patients. More studies are needed, especially multicenter, adequately powered diagnostic research, to will help establish the usefulness of the IVC/Ao ratio.","Octavius GS, Imanuelly M, Wibowo J, Heryadi NK, Widjaja M",Clin Exp Pediatr,2023 Nov,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
34566316,Suppressive effect of goat bile in Plasmodium berghei ANKA infection in mice.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Some individuals in Indonesia consume intact goat gallbladder to prevent and treat malaria. The acute and subacute toxicity tests of goat bile (GB) have shown mild diarrhea in mice. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the suppressive effect of GB on parasitemia, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and blood biochemistry to assess liver and kidney function in BALB/c mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty healthy mice were infected with P. berghei ANKA and divided into five groups. Mice in three groups were administered 0.5 mL of 25%, 50%, or 100% of GB by gavage. Animals in Group 4 were administered 187.2 mg/kg BW of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine phosphate as a positive control (POS Group). Mice in fifth group were administered sterile water as negative (NEG) controls. Further, 30 uninfected mice were divided into groups 6-8 and administered GB as were mice in the first three groups. Group 9 included 10 uninfected and untreated animals as healthy controls. Treatments were administered in a 4-day suppressive test followed by daily observation of Giemsa-stained blood smears. On day 7, mice were sacrificed to measure the length and weight of spleens and livers, plasma levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine. RESULTS: GB suppressed parasitemia but did not affect the size and weight of spleens or livers or plasma levels of AST and ALT compared to uninfected GB-treated and healthy control animals. Conversely, plasma levels of BUN and creatinine were suppressed and remained in the normal range in all groups of mice. CONCLUSION: GB suppresses parasitemia with no significant impact on hepatic enzymes in GB-treated infected mice. Liver dysfunction in GB-treated infected mice was due to P. berghei rather than GB treatment.","Arwati H, Bahalwan RR, Hapsari WT, Wardhani KA, Aini KN, Apsari PIB, Wardhani P",Vet World,2021 Aug,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
24669783,"Risk factors of rotavirus diarrhea in hospitalized children in Sanglah Hospital, Denpasar: a prospective cohort study.","BACKGROUND: Diarrhea is a major public health concern throughout the world because the prevalence of morbidity of diarrhea has not changed significantly in the past decade. It remains the third leading cause of death among children less than 5 years of age. Recent surveillance studies have shown that rotavirus is a significant cause of pediatric hospitalization and death due to diarrhea. Indonesia has limited data on risk factors, disease burden, and deaths in children due to rotavirus diarrhea. The objective of this study was to examine the above mentioned factors related to rotavirus diarrhea in hospitalized children in Sanglah Hospital, Denpasar. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted at Sanglah Hospital Denpasar from April 2009 to December 2011. The present study was part of a nationwide study on Extension for Hospital-based Surveillance and Strain Characterization of Rotavirus Diarrhea Indonesia involving four hospitals throughout Indonesia as a part of the Asian Rotavirus Surveillance Network. We studied children aged <5 years who were hospitalized with acute diarrhea, and analyzed their stool samples using an immunoassay that detects the rotavirus antigen. RESULTS: A total of 656 patients met the inclusion criteria for this study. Of 5805 patients under the age of 5 who were hospitalized between April 2009 and December 2011, the prevalence of diarrhea among hospitalized pediatric patients was 11.3% and the prevalence of rotavirus diarrhea was 49.8%. The male to female ratio of those affected by rotavirus was 1.6:1. The occurrence of vomiting was significantly higher in rotavirus diarrhea than in non-rotavirus diarrhea (RR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.70; p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Diarrhea remains an important cause of hospitalization in children, and rotavirus was the most important etiology. We found that boys had a greatest risk of rotavirus infection than girls. Good nutritional status and breastfeeding provided the same protection against rotavirus and non-rotavirus diarrhea.","Salim H, Karyana IP, Sanjaya-Putra IG, Budiarsa S, Soenarto Y",BMC Gastroenterol,2014 Mar 26,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
36625390,"Complete genome analyses of G12P[8] rotavirus strains from hospitalized children in Surabaya, Indonesia, 2017-2018.","Rotavirus A (RVA) is a major viral cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) worldwide. G12 RVA strains have emerged globally since 2007. There has been no report of the whole genome sequences of G12 RVAs in Indonesia. We performed the complete genome analysis by the next-generation sequencing of five G12 strains from hospitalized children with AGE in Surabaya from 2017 to 2018. All five G12 strains were Wa-like strains (G12-P[8]-I1-R1-C1-M1-A1-N1-T1-E1-H1) and were clustered into lineage-III of VP7 gene phylogenetic tree. STM430 sample was observed as a mixed-infection between G12 and G1 strains: G12/G1-P[8]-I1-R1-C1-M1-A1-N1-T1-E1-H1. A phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that all five Indonesian G12 strains (SOEP379, STM371, STM413, STM430, and STM433) were genetically close to each other in all 11 genome segments with 98.0%-100% nucleotide identities, except VP3 and NSP4 of STM430, suggesting that these strains have originated from a similar ancestral G12 RVA. The VP3 and NSP4 genome segments of STM430-G12P[8] were separated phylogenetically from those of the other four G12 strains, probably due to intra-genotype reassortment between the G12 and G1 Wa-like strains. The change from G12P[6] lineage-II in 2007 to G12P[8] lineage-III 2017-2018 suggests the evolution and diversity of G12 RVAs in Indonesia over the past approximately 10 years.","Yamani LN, Utsumi T, Doan YH, Fujii Y, Dinana Z, Wahyuni RM, Gunawan E, Soegijanto S, Athiyyah AF, Sudarmo SM, Ranuh RG, Darma A, Soetjipto, Juniastuti, Bawono RG, Matsui C, Deng L, Abe T, Shimizu H, Ishii K, Katayama K, Lusida MI, Shoji I",J Med Virol,2023 Feb,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
36640074,"RECTAL PROLAPSE IN THE SULAWESI CRESTED BLACK MACAQUE (MACACA NIGRA): MORBIDITY, MORTALITY, AND RISK FACTORS.","Empirical data suggest that rectal prolapse (RP) is common in captive Sulawesi crested black macaques (Macaca nigra) in Europe, resulting in the euthanasia of animals that experience repeat occurrences. However, the prevalence, etiology, and risk factors of RP remain unidentified. The aims of this retrospective study were to assess the morbidity and mortality of RP, to provide an overview of management practices, and to identify risk factors for RP in this species. A questionnaire was sent to all European Ex situ Programme institutions that housed M. nigra between 01 January 2014 and 31 December 2020. Zoological Information Management System medical records and the studbook were used to obtain additional information. The questionnaire had a response rate of 65%, accounting for 204 animals. Of these animals, 25 (12.3%) suffered from at least one RP event during the study period and recurrence was noted in 72%. The majority of prolapses reverted naturally, but 28% of afflicted animals were euthanized for this ailment. Institutions with M. nigra with high frequencies of diarrhea (P= 0.035), those that provided diets of >/=90% vegetables and high-fiber pellet (P < 0.001), and those with more male than female M. nigra (P < 0.001) had increased odds of RP. Institutions that provided fruits daily (P < 0.002) had reduced odds of having RP cases. Although correlation of RP with diet was identified, confounding cannot be excluded, and a detailed dietary analysis needs to take place before altering feeding practices. Acute stressors and detection of protozoa in fecal samples were common findings before an RP event. Demographic analysis indicated that aged females, young males, and subordinate individuals were most affected by this condition. Where tested during an RP intervention, animals had low serum levels of vitamin D. Pedigree analysis hinted at genetic predisposition in this species and requires further investigation.","Van de Weyer Y, Rowden LJ, Guthrie A, Tahas SA",J Zoo Wildl Med,2023 Jan,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
31837954,A comprehensive assessment of universal health coverage in 111 countries: a retrospective observational study.,"BACKGROUND: The goal of universal health coverage (UHC) requires that everyone receive needed health services, and that families who get needed services do not suffer undue financial hardship. Tracking progress towards UHC requires measurement of both these dimensions, and a way of trading them off against one another. METHODS: We measured service coverage by a weighted geometric average of four prevention indicators (antenatal care, full immunisation, and screening for breast and cervical cancers) and four treatment indicators (skilled birth attendance, inpatient admission, and treatment for acute respiratory infection and diarrhoea), financial protection by the incidence of catastrophic health expenditures (those exceeding 10% of household consumption or income), and a country's UHC performance as a geometric average of the service coverage index and the complement of the incidence of catastrophic expenditures. Where possible, we adjusted service coverage for inequality, penalising countries with a high level of inequality. The bulk of data used in this study were from the World Bank's Health Equity and Financial Protection Indicators database (2019 version), comprising data from household surveys. Gaps in the data were supplemented with other survey data and (where necessary) non-survey data from other sources (administrative, modelled, and imputed data). FINDINGS: A low incidence of catastrophic expenses sometimes reflects low service coverage (often in low-income countries) but sometimes occurs despite high service coverage (often in high-income countries). At a given level of service coverage, financial protection also varies. UHC index scores are generally higher in higher-income countries, but there are variations within income groups. Adjusting the UHC index for inequality in service coverage makes little difference in some countries, but reduces it by more than 10% in others. Seven of the 12 countries for which we were able to produce trend data have increased their UHC index over time (with the greatest average yearly increases seen in Ghana [1.43%], Indonesia [1.85%], and Vietnam [2.26%]), mostly by improving both financial protection and service coverage. Some increased their UHC index, despite reductions in financial protection, by substantially increasing their service coverage. The UHC index decreased in five of 12 countries with trend data, mostly because financial protection worsened with stagnant or declining service coverage. Our UHC indicators (except inpatient admissions) are significantly and positively associated with GDP per capita, and most are correlated with the share of health spending channelled through social health insurance and government schemes. However, associations of our UHC indicators with the share of GDP spent on health and the shares of health spending channelled through non-profit and private insurance are ambiguous. INTERPRETATION: Progress towards UHC can be tracked using an index that captures both service coverage and financial protection. Although per-capita income is a good predictor of a country's UHC index score, some countries perform better than others in the same income group or even in the income group above their own. Strong UHC performance is correlated with the share of a country's health budget that is channelled through government and social health insurance schemes.

40168384,Antibiotic prescribing for children five years or younger in Indonesian primary care settings.,"INTRODUCTION: Children are at a higher risk of antibiotic overprescribing, while limited surveillance is evident in primary care settings. This study aims to examine patterns of infections and associated antibiotic use in children attending Primary Health Centers (PHCs), including an explanatory analysis of antibiotics for non-pneumonia acute respiratory infections (ARIs), pneumonia, and diarrhea. METHODOLOGY: An observational study used records of all children  5 years of age prescribed antibiotics from January 2019 to December 2020 in selected PHCs in Surabaya and Banjarmasin, Indonesia. Data on children's characteristics, diagnoses, and antibiotics prescribed, were collected from patient records. The explanatory analysis was based on national guidelines. A descriptive analysis was used to summarize the data. RESULTS: A total of 1053 and 1463 children's records with antibiotics were located at Surabaya and Banjarmasin PHCs, respectively. ARIs were the most common indications for antibiotic prescribing in both settings, either non-pneumonia ARIs (60.6% versus 33.8%, respectively) or pneumonia (20.2% versus 25.2%, respectively). High conformity with guidelines were evident for antibiotics used for pneumonia (i.e., amoxicillin/cotrimoxazole/erythromycin - 89.3%) or specified upper ARIs (e.g., amoxicillin for pharyngitis - 73.9%), and for diarrhea (i.e., cotrimoxazole - 73.1%). However, some information, such as diagnoses, were not recorded or were unspecific, hence limiting assessment. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided insights into prescribing antibiotics among children in Indonesia. Lack of specific guidelines for children and inadequate documentation for antibiotic prescribing warrants improvement. Larger prospective studies should assess appropriate prescribing at the national level to optimize the use of antibiotics.","Wibowo YI, Firdhausi N, Rahmah N, Setianur N, Sunderland B, Setiadi AP",J Infect Dev Ctries,2025 Mar 31,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
9425374,"Morbidity and growth performance of infants in Madura, Indonesia.","Between January 1987 and July 1988, all children born in two villages on the island of Madura, Indonesia were visited weekly by a field worker trained to interview mothers on disease symptoms. The maximum recall period was 1 week. All infants were measured (weight and height) at monthly intervals. Information on growth and morbidity is analysed for infants from birth until the age of 11 months. Morbidity, defined as acute respiratory tract infection (ARI), diarrhoea, fever and other diseases, is analysed over 4-week periods and related to growth performance. In total, there are 1373 4-week reporting periods with morbidity information from birth to the age of 12 months. Of all the diseases recorded (1021), 47% were ARI, 13% diarrhoea, 14% fever and 26% other diseases. The average (SD) duration of diarrhoea was 7 (11) days, ARI 14 (9) days, fever 6 (4) days and 16 (10) days for other diseases. The most striking results in this analysis are: (i) the lack of a relationship between morbidity and growth (either linear or weight) during the 1st 6 months of life; (ii) the existence of a relationship between illness and weight increment for which only ARI showed significant influence for infants of 6 months and more; (iii) the lack of a relationship between morbidity and linear growth performance at all ages; and (iv) the fact that no cumulative effect of disease on growth performance was found to explain the observations.","Kolsteren PW, Kusin JA, Kardjati S",Ann Trop Paediatr,1997 Sep,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
40276188,Jembrana disease in Indonesia: An updated review.,"Jembrana illness is an infectious disease that affects Balinese cattle in Indonesia. This disease is caused by the Jembrana disease virus (JDV), a lentivirus of the Retroviridae family. It was initially detected in 1964 in Jembrana Regency, Bali, Indonesia. Bali cattle have been widely disseminated throughout the Indonesian archipelago, and there is evidence that Jembrana disease has affected Bali cattle on the islands of Bali, Sumatra, and Java. During the acute stage, JDV is present in secreted fluids such as saliva, milk, and nasal secretions. There is no evidence of clinical illness recurrence in animals that have survived acute JDV infection. The clinical symptoms of Jembrana illness in cattle include elevated fever, stool bloody diarrhea, increased salivation, and enlarged lymph nodes. Jembrana illness is transmitted through direct contact between sick and healthy cows. This disease is also believed to be spread by blood-sucking insects, including flies, fleas, and mosquitoes. The most common risk factors are unregulated animal traffic movements that are not even under the supervision of animal health officers. Livestock producers suffered immediate financial losses as a result of the local epidemic of the Jembrana disease. Although there is currently no known cure for Jembrana disease, it can be prevented with vaccination. To stop the spread of the disease, livestock travel must also be considered.","Meles DK, Khairullah AR, Utama S, Wurlina W, Mulyati S, Mustofa I, Rimayanti R, Lestari TD, Moses IB, Wibowo S, Wardhani BWK, Kurniasih DAA, Kusala MKJ, Ahmad RZ, Fauziah I, Wasito W, Akintunde AO",Open Vet J,2025 Mar,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
39412871,Surveillance of travel-associated isolates elucidates the diversity of non-pandemic Vibrio cholerae.,"Vibrio cholerae is a Gram-negative bacterium found in aquatic environments and is the aetiological agent of cholera, characterized by acute watery diarrhoea and severe dehydration. Cholera presents a significant global health burden of an estimated 1.3-5 million annual cases, with the current pandemic caused by a toxigenic lineage of the O1 El Tor biotype called seventh pandemic El Tor (7PET) that is still ongoing. Whilst it is known that non-7PET lineages can cause sporadic disease, little is known about the transmission of these non-epidemic lineages. Thirty-four V. cholerae isolates were obtained from travellers returning from Indonesia to Australia between 2005 and 2017. These were whole genome sequenced, placed into a global phylogenetic context with 883 isolates, and screened for known genes associated with antimicrobial resistance and virulence. This analysis revealed that 30 isolates fell within non-7PET lineages and four within the 7PET lineage. Both 7PET and non-7PET isolates carried genes for resistance to antibiotics that are commonly used in cholera treatment such as tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones. Diverse virulence factors were also present in non-7PET isolates, with two isolates notably carrying toxin-coregulated pilus genes, which are primarily responsible for intestinal colonization in 7PET V. cholerae. This study demonstrates the role of travel in long-range carriage of epidemic and non-epidemic lineages of V. cholerae, and how sentinel travel surveillance can enrich our knowledge of V. cholerae diversity, reveal new biology about the spread of diverse lineages with differing disease potential and illuminate disease presence in endemic regions with limited surveillance data.","Bote L, Taylor-Brown A, Maes M, Ingle DJ, Valcanis M, Howden BP, Thomson NR",Microb Genom,2024 Oct,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
24920797,Intranasal P particle vaccine provided partial cross-variant protection against human GII.4 norovirus diarrhea in gnotobiotic pigs.,"Noroviruses (NoVs) are the leading cause of nonbacterial acute gastroenteritis worldwide in people of all ages. The P particle is a novel vaccine candidate derived from the protruding (P) domain of the NoV VP1 capsid protein. This study utilized the neonatal gnotobiotic pig model to evaluate the protective efficacies of primary infection, P particles, and virus-like particles (VLPs) against NoV infection and disease and the T cell responses to these treatments. Pigs either were vaccinated intranasally with GII.4/1997 NoV (VA387)-derived P particles or VLPs or were inoculated orally with a GII.4/2006b NoV variant. At postinoculation day (PID) 28, pigs either were euthanized or were challenged with the GII.4/2006b variant and monitored for diarrhea and virus shedding for 7 days. The T cell responses in intestinal and systemic lymphoid tissues were examined. Primary NoV infection provided 83% homologous protection against diarrhea and 49% homologous protection against virus shedding, while the P particle and VLP vaccines provided cross-variant protection (47% and 60%, respectively) against diarrhea. The protection rates against diarrhea are significantly inversely correlated with T cell expansion in the duodenum and are positively correlated with T cell expansion in the ileum and spleen. The P particle vaccine primed for stronger immune responses than VLPs, including significantly higher numbers of activated CD4+ T cells in all tissues, gamma interferon-producing (IFN-gamma+) CD8+ T cells in the duodenum, regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the blood, and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta)-producing CD4+ CD25- FoxP3+ Tregs in the spleen postchallenge, indicating that P particles are more immunogenic than VLPs at the same dose. In conclusion, the P particle vaccine is a promising vaccine candidate worthy of further development. IMPORTANCE: The norovirus (NoV) P particle is a vaccine candidate derived from the protruding (P) domain of the NoV VP1 capsid protein. P particles can be easily produced in Escherichia coli at high yields and thus may be more economically viable than the virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine. This study demonstrated, for the first time, the cross-variant protection (46.7%) of the intranasal P particle vaccine against human NoV diarrhea and revealed in detail the intestinal and systemic T cell responses by using the gnotobiotic pig model. The cross-variant protective efficacy of the P particle vaccine was comparable to that of the VLP vaccine in pigs (60%) and to the homologous protective efficacy of the VLP vaccine in humans (47%). NoV is now the leading cause of pediatric dehydrating diarrhea, responsible for approximately 1 million hospital visits for U.S. children and 218,000 deaths in developing countries. The P particle vaccine holds promise for reducing the disease burden and mortality.","Kocher J, Bui T, Giri-Rachman E, Wen K, Li G, Yang X, Liu F, Tan M, Xia M, Zhong W, Jiang X, Yuan L",J Virol,2014 Sep 1,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
40034976,Diagnosis and Management of Dengue Fever in a Nonendemic Country: Lessons From an Acute Febrile Illness in Iran During the COVID-19 Outbreak.,"Dengue fever is a tropical arboviral disease that presents with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations and can occasionally emerge in nonendemic regions due to factors such as international travel. This case report details a 47-year-old Iranian man who had recently returned from Jakarta, Indonesia, presenting with fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and myalgia during the COVID-19 outbreak. Despite initial misdiagnoses, dengue fever was confirmed through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Moreover, the serological analysis using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) further demonstrated the presence of both IgM and IgG antibodies against the dengue virus. Initially, the patient's symptoms overlapped with COVID-19 and gastrointestinal infections, complicating the diagnosis. The management included supportive care, precautions against bleeding, fluid therapy, and empirical antibiotics due to suspected coinfections. This case highlights the importance of considering travel history and the possibility of nonendemic diseases in the differential diagnosis of febrile illnesses of unknown origin (FUO), particularly during concurrent outbreaks. Comprehensive history-taking and rigorous diagnostic evaluation are essential in such cases.","Mozahheb Yousefi K, Aminian S, Ebrahimi M, Minaeian S, Laali A",Case Rep Infect Dis,2025,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia

Rotavirus is the leading cause of severe diarrhea in children under two years of age. This study aimed to determine the genotypes of rotavirus in Bintuni Bay, Papua. METHODS: Stool specimens from 15 patients were collected and analyzed for rotavirus using an enzyme immunosorbent assay (EIA) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Subsequently, we sequenced the genetic material of rotavirus positive samples by RT-PCR and analyzed the results using Mega-4 software. RESULTS: Two rotavirus serotypes were identified from the diarrhea outbreak in Bintuni, Papua in October 2008: serotype G1 with G1P[6] (50%) and G1P[8] (16.7%) strains, and serotype G2 with G2P[4] (23.3%) strain. Phylogenetic tree analyses of VP7 protein showed that rotavirus-infected diarrhea in Bintuni Bay, Papua at that time was dominated by the G1 serotype (83%). CONCLUSION: The laboratory results showed that G1 serotype rotavirus was a cause of the outbreak of diarrhea in October 2008 in Bintuni, Papua.","Pratiwi E, Setiawaty V, Putranto RH",Virology (Auckl),2014,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia

A serotype could be assigned to 59 of 111 specimens (53%). Inability to assign a serotype to 47% of specimens was probably due to loss of the outer capsid during transport of specimens from Indonesia to Australia. All four major human rotavirus serotypes were detected during the 15 month survey from June 1978 to August 1979, including one serotype 1, 5 serotype 2, 31 serotype 3, and 21 serotype 4 strains. One additional strain reacted with serotype 3 and 4 Mabs. Serotype 3 strains showed intratypic variation. The relative frequency of serotypes 2, 3, and 4 varied during the 15 months and appeared to be influenced by climatic changes associated with dry and wet seasons. Vaccine strategies must take account of comparatively rapid changes of predominant serotypes in a community and are only likely to be successful if comprehensive immunity can be established simultaneously against the four major human serotypes.","Bishop RF, Unicomb LE, Soenarto Y, Suwardji H, Ristanto, Barnes GL",Arch Virol,1989,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
32974583,First case report of Schistosoma japonicum in Nepal.,"BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis, globally, is significant public as well as veterinary health problem as it is associated with a wide range of clinical conditions in humans and animals. Schistosomiasis is mostly caused by the following species of genus Schistosoma: Schistosoma japonicum, Schistosoma haematobium, Schistosoma mekongi, Schistosoma intercalatum Schistosoma guineensis, Schistosoma malayensis and Schistosoma mansoni. S. japonicum might be considered as the most pathogenic among these species as the clinical disease caused by this parasite ranges from mild diarrhea, nausea, Katayama fever, portal hypertension, splenomegaly and ascites to liver cirrhosis and fibrosis. S. japonicum has been commonly encountered in China, the Philippines and Indonesia. According to WHO, at least 220.8 million people required preventive treatment for schistosomiasis in 2017 but only 102.3 million people were reported to have been treated. To our knowledge, there are no cases reported from Nepal. Hence, this is the first reported case of S. japonicum in Nepal. CASE PRESENTATION: A case of acute schistosomiasis due to S. japonicum was identified in CIWEC Hospital and Travel Medicine Center, Kathmandu, Nepal. The patient arrived with gastrointestinal symptoms without any pre-existing chronic illness with no evidence of travel outside of Spain since last August, but had travelled to many other countries 2 years ago. Timely diagnosis by stool routine and microscopic examination and formal-ether concentration technique led to successful treatment of the disease. CONCLUSION: As the parasite has not been reported to date in Nepal, many people are unaware of its mode of infection and pathogenesis. Many laboratory workers are heedless with the egg of the parasite due to which this parasite might be misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. This case report might help laboratory workers to be sentient about the parasite and further diagnosis in future.","Bajracharya D, Pandit S, Bhandari D",Access Microbiol,2020,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
24818147,Effect of Toona microcarpa Harms leaf extract on the coagulation system.,"Toona microcarpa Harms is a tonic, antiperiodic, antirheumatic, and antithrombotic agent in China and India and an astringent and tonic for treating diarrhea, dysentery, and other intestinal infections in Indonesia. In this study, we prepared ethyl-acetate extract from the air-dried leaves of Toona microcarpa Harms and investigated the anticoagulant activities in vitro by performing activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), and thrombin time (TT) assays. Antiplatelet aggregation activity of the extract was examined using adenosine diphosphate (ADP), collagen, and thrombin as agonists, and the inhibitions of factor Xa and thrombin were also investigated. Bleeding and clotting times in mice were used to determine its anticoagulant activities in vivo. It is found that Toona microcarpa Harms leaf extract (TMHE) prolonged APTT, PT, and TT clotting times in a dose-dependent manner and significantly inhibited platelet aggregation induced by thrombin, but not ADP or collagen. Clotting time and bleeding time assays showed that TMHE significantly prolonged clotting and bleeding times in vivo. In addition, at the concentration of 1 mg/mL, TMHE inhibited human thrombin activity by 73.98 +/- 2.78%. This is the first report to demonstrate that THME exhibits potent anticoagulant effects, possibly via inhibition of thrombin activity.","Chen H, Jin M, Wang YF, Wang YQ, Meng L, Li R, Wang JP, Gao L, Kong Y, Wei JF",Biomed Res Int,2014,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
27932284,Genetic diversity of coronaviruses in bats in Lao PDR and Cambodia.,"South-East Asia is a hot spot for emerging zoonotic diseases, and bats have been recognized as hosts for a large number of zoonotic viruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), responsible for acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks. Thus, it is important to expand our knowledge of the presence of viruses in bats which could represent a risk to humans. Coronaviruses (CoVs) have been reported in bat species from Thailand, China, Indonesia, Taiwan and the Philippines. However no such work was conducted in Cambodia or Lao PDR. Between 2010 and 2013, 1965 bats were therefore sampled at interfaces with human populations in these two countries. They were tested for the presence of coronavirus by consensus reverse transcription-PCR assay. A total of 93 samples (4.7%) from 17 genera of bats tested positive. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of potentially 37 and 56 coronavirus belonging to alpha-coronavirus (alphaCoV) and beta-CoV (betaCoV), respectively. The betaCoVs group is known to include some coronaviruses highly pathogenic to human, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. All coronavirus sequences generated from frugivorous bats (family Pteropodidae) (n=55) clustered with other bat betaCoVs of lineage D, whereas one coronavirus from Pipistrellus coromandra fell in the lineage C of betaCoVs which also includes the MERS-CoV. alphaCoVs were all detected in various genera of insectivorous bats and clustered with diverse bat alphaCoV sequences previously published. A closely related strain of PEDV, responsible for severe diarrhea in pigs (PEDV-CoV), was detected in 2 Myotis bats.

17703171,"Scombroid fish poisoning associated with tuna steaks--Louisiana and Tennessee, 2006.","Scombroid fish poisoning is an acute illness that occurs after eating fish containing high levels of histamine or other biogenic amines. Symptoms typically include facial flushing, sweating, rash, a burning or peppery taste in the mouth, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps and usually resolve within several hours without medical intervention. More severe symptoms (e.g., respiratory distress, swelling of the tongue and throat, and blurred vision) can occur and require medical treatment with antihistamines. In late 2006, two outbreaks of scombroid fish poisoning occurred, one in Louisiana and one in Tennessee. To determine the source of the outbreaks and to implement control measures, CDC and the state health departments in Louisiana and Tennessee conducted epidemiologic investigations, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted traceback investigations of the product. This report describes the results of those investigations, which indicated that the outbreaks in Louisiana and Tennessee were associated with tuna steaks from Indonesia and Vietnam, respectively. The majority of seafood eaten in the United States is imported. FDA programs to identify and prevent seafood hazards such as scombroid fish poisoning have made substantial progress but are able to inspect only a small proportion of seafood entering the United States.

21746735,"Application of standard treatment guidelines in rural community health centres, Timor-Leste.","OBJECTIVE: To analyse nurses' and midwives' knowledge of and attitudes towards standard treatment guidelines (STGs), which were developed to help their practices at rural community health centres (CHCs) in Timor-Leste. METHODS: Fifty-five nurses and midwives were individually interviewed. Data were analysed qualitatively using the Framework approach. RESULTS: Overall, the standard treatments for acute respiratory tract infections, malaria and diarrhoea were well known by the respondents. Clinical nurses showed precise and detailed knowledge, especially for antibiotic use. The respondents were willing to use STGs and believed that they 'should' follow them. This feeling arose due to their self-awareness as frontline health workers and, at the same time, as peripheral civil servants. The changes brought about by the introduction of STGs were positively perceived. Three components of the change were observed: the concept, daily practice and perceived patient satisfaction. The respondents had previously felt a lack of confidence and hoped to improve their capacity as health care workers; they became confident in their practices by using STGs. Self-confidence was identified more clearly in the clinical nurse interviews. Few difficulties in using STGs were indicated, and the respondents suggested ways to deal with these difficulties. DISCUSSION: By using the STGs, the nurses/midwives gained knowledge and self-confidence. The positive perception of the changes promoted further use of the STGs. Clinical nurse training positively influenced the knowledge of and attitudes towards the STGs. Few difficulties in applying STGs in daily practice were identified, which is contrary to previous studies that targeted physicians in the Western world. Development of STGs within a health policy framework was considered a key factor. The STGs exist across related policies and various programmes, which are interconnected. The Timor-Leste experience indicates the value of STGs for non-physician health care providers at the primary health care level.","Higuchi M, Okumura J, Aoyama A, Suryawati S, Porter J",Health Policy Plan,2012 Aug,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
23364878,Optimal recall period for caregiver-reported illness in risk factor and intervention studies: a multicountry study.,"Many community-based studies of acute child illness rely on cases reported by caregivers. In prior investigations, researchers noted a reporting bias when longer illness recall periods were used. The use of recall periods longer than 2-3 days has been discouraged to minimize this reporting bias. In the present study, we sought to determine the optimal recall period for illness measurement when accounting for both bias and variance. Using data from 12,191 children less than 24 months of age collected in 2008-2009 from Himachal Pradesh in India, Madhya Pradesh in India, Indonesia, Peru, and Senegal, we calculated bias, variance, and mean squared error for estimates of the prevalence ratio between groups defined by anemia, stunting, and underweight status to identify optimal recall periods for caregiver-reported diarrhea, cough, and fever. There was little bias in the prevalence ratio when a 7-day recall period was used (<10% in 35 of 45 scenarios), and the mean squared error was usually minimized with recall periods of 6 or more days. Shortening the recall period from 7 days to 2 days required sample-size increases of 52%-92% for diarrhea, 47%-61% for cough, and 102%-206% for fever. In contrast to the current practice of using 2-day recall periods, this work suggests that studies should measure caregiver-reported illness with a 7-day recall period.","Arnold BF, Galiani S, Ram PK, Hubbard AE, Briceno B, Gertler PJ, Colford JM Jr",Am J Epidemiol,2013 Feb 15,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
33387865,Differentiating Chilaiditi's Syndrome with hollow viscus perforation: A case report.,"INTRODUCTION: Chilaiditi's syndrome is a rare condition accounting for only 0.25%-0.28% of all abdominal imaging worldwide. To rule out Chilaiditi's syndrome from other acute abdominal emergencies is very important to avoid unnecessary treatment or surgical procedure. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 25-year-old female presented in the emergency room with 1 week history of abdominal discomfort. At time of examination, she had a mild shortness of breath that was not related with rigorous activities. A plain abdominal x-ray was suggested the presence of an air-filled bowel tract within the right subphrenic space (Fig. 1). Abdominal computed tomography suggested colonic loop present between the right hemi-diaphragm and liver. The absence of abdominal free air confirmed an isolated pseudo-pneumoperitoneum due to colonic interposition between the liver and diaphragm. DISCUSSION: Chilaiditi sign is radiolucency in the subdiaphragmatic space as a result of bowel interposition between a diaphragm and the liver. If gastrointestinal symptoms present, the condition is known as Chilaiditi's syndrome. The abdominal symptoms including severe pain, anorexia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, bloating and constipation might mislead physicians or surgeons with diaphragmatic hernia, subdiaphragmatic abscess, bowel perforation, infected hydatid cyst and liver tumor. Thorough physical examination, imaging, and timely follow up is very important to avoid unnecessary exploratory laparotomies.

34419704,Antiviral treatment could not provide clinical benefit in management of mild COVID-19: A Retrospective Experience from Field hospital.,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected over 145 million infected people and 3 million deaths worldwide. There has been limited data to recommend either for or against use of antiviral regimens in mild COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to compare clinical outcomes between mild COVID-19 patients receiving antiviral drugs and those without. METHOD: Thai patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at field hospital affiliated to Thammasat University Hospital, Thailand were evaluated between January 1, 2020 and April 13, 2021. Patients' data, clinical presentation, past medical history, laboratory results, and treatment outcomes were extensively reviewed. RESULTS: Five hundred patients with positive tests were included in the study. The mean age was 35.9 years; 46% males. There were 225 (45%), 207 (41.4%), 44 (8.8%), 18 (3.6%), 6 (1.2%) patients with asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19, respectively. Of 207 mild COVID-19 patients, 9 (4.3%) received lopinavir/ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir, 17 (8.2%) received favipiravir, while 175 (84.5%) had only supportive care. Mild COVID-19 patients receiving antiviral treatment had longer median length of hospital stay [13 days (IQR 11-14) vs. 10 days (IQR 8-12), p < 0.001] than patients having only supportive treatment. Antiviral drug use was significantly associated with longer hospital stay (>10 days) in mild COVID-19 patients (OR 5.52; 95%CI 2.12-14.40, p < 0.001). Adverse drug reactions such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hepatitis were also demonstrated in our COVID-19 patients with antiviral treatments. Majority of patients (97.6%) recovered without any complications and were discharged home. Two deaths were caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome from severe COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Antiviral treatment could not provide superior clinical outcomes to supportive care in mild COVID-19 patients. Mild COVID-19 patients receiving antiviral medication had longer length of hospital stay than those without. Standard supportive care and regular monitoring of disease progression might be keys for successful management of mild COVID-19.","Aumpan N, Vilaichone RK, Ratana-Amornpin S, Teerakapibal S, Toochinda P, Witoonchart G, Nitikraipot S",J Infect Public Health,2021 Sep,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
1782383,The Quality Assurance Project: introducing quality improvement to primary health care in less developed countries.,"Persistently excessive morbidity and mortality rates in less developed countries (LDCs) served by primary health care systems suggest that the quality of services is inadequate. The PRICOR project, sponsored by the United States Agency for International Development, has designed and implemented methods for quality assessment and problem solving in LDC health systems. After developing comprehensive lists of essential activities and tasks, similar to practice parameters, for seven child survival interventions, PRICOR supported comprehensive quality assessment studies in twelve LDC countries. The studies, yielding over 6000 observations of health worker-client encounters, indicated highly prevalent, serious program deficiencies in areas including diagnosis, treatment, patient education and supervision. To facilitate corrective action, PRICOR assisted managers in conducting operations research to resolve priority problems revealed by the assessments. The recently initiated Quality Assurance Project is building on PRICOR techniques in designing and implementing sustainable continuous quality improvement programs for LDC health systems.","Nicholas DD, Heiby JR, Hatzell TA",Qual Assur Health Care,1991,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia

34507533,The role of multimodality imaging in diagnosing acute perimyocarditis secondary to Crohn's disease.,"BACKGROUND: Acute perimyocarditis is a rare extra-intestinal manifestation in Crohn's disease which required multimodality imaging to confirm the diagnosis. Here we present a case of acute perimyocarditis as the first presentation of Crohn's disease. To date, this is the first case presentation reporting the use of (18)F-FDG PET/CT Scan for diagnosing such condition. CASE PRESENTATION: A 25-year-old male presented to our hospital with severe persistent pleuritic sharp left-sided chest pain. This was his second hospital admission in the past 4 months for chest pain and diarrhea. At the first hospitalization, he was diagnosed with viral perimyocarditis and irritable bowel syndrome. Laboratory findings, electrocardiogram, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging results confirm the diagnostic of perimyocarditis. Virology, bacteriology, parasitology, and autoimmune evaluations were unremarkable. Colonoscopy, colorectal biopsy, and (18)FGD PET findings confirmed manifestation of perimyocarditis, Crohn's disease, and negative for sarcoidosis. CONCLUSIONS: Looking at the overall clinical picture and investigation results of colonoscopy, colorectal biopsy findings, as well as multi-modality imaging with echocardiography, (18)FDG PET-scan and CMRI, the patient was diagnosed to have perimyocarditis attending Chron's disease flare up as a rare extra-intestinal manifestation.","Prameswari HS, Balakrishnan ID, Khoo CY, Teo LY, Chan LL, Ng CT",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,2021 Sep 10,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
38504680,Suboptimal child healthcare practices and the development of multiple infectious diseases in children aged 24-59 months.,"BACKGROUND: Infections continue to be a major cause of death among children under the age of five worldwide. This study aimed to identify the factors associated with the development of multiple infectious diseases in children aged 24-59 months in Indonesia. METHODS: Data from the 2018 Basic Health Research conducted by the Ministry of Health, Republic of Indonesia, were used. Information from 39,948 children aged 24-59 months was analyzed. The outcome variable was the development of multiple infectious diseases, that is, acute respiratory infections, pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, diarrhea, and hepatitis, in the month before the survey. Factors significantly associated with multiple types of infectious diseases were examined using logistic regression. RESULTS: The study found that 76.6% of children aged 24 to 59 months in Indonesia had at least one type of infectious disease. The likelihood of developing multiple types of infectious diseases increased in children whose parents did not practice appropriate handwashing with soap and running water [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.16, p < 0.001], those who received supplemental food (aOR = 1.38, p < 0.001), those with poor nutritional status (aOR = 1.12, p < 0.001), and those living in urban areas (aOR = 1.07, p = 0.045). CONCLUSION: Improving caregivers' awareness of adequate child healthcare practices, in addition to nutrition-sensitive and specific interventions to improve children's nutritional status, is required to prevent children from contracting multiple types of infectious diseases.","Sulistiyowati N, Tjandrarini DH, Titaley CR, Que BJ, Hidayangsih PS, Suparmi, Sudikno S, Purwatiningsih Y, Indrawati L, Siahaan S, Adyarani WP",Front Public Health,2024,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia

9361578,Prevalence of infection with dengue virus among international travelers.,"BACKGROUND: Dengue has been recognized as a potential hazard to tourists. A prospective, controlled study in the outpatient clinic of a German infectious disease clinic was conducted to assess the prevalence of dengue virus infection among international travelers. METHODS: Serum samples from 130 patients with signs or recent history clinically compatible with dengue (fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, or rash), 95 matched controls with diarrhea, and 26 patients who never visited a country endemic for dengue were investigated. RESULTS: Nine (6.9%) of the 130 patients with compatible symptoms and 1 (1%) of the 95 controls with diarrhea developed rising antibody titers against dengue virus. Of these 10 patients with probable dengue infection, 6 had been to Thailand, 2 to Malaysia, and 1 each to Indonesia and Brazil. CONCLUSIONS: Infection with dengue virus appears to be a realistic threat to travelers to Southeast Asia. Symptoms commonly associated with dengue, such as fever, myalgia, arthralgia, and vomiting, can be helpful for diagnosis when present, but the absence of typical symptoms does not exclude infection.","Jelinek T, Dobler G, Holscher M, Loscher T, Nothdurft HD",Arch Intern Med,1997 Nov 10,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
26282537,"Diagnosis of neglected tropical diseases among patients with persistent digestive disorders (diarrhoea and/or abdominal pain >/=14 days): Pierrea multi-country, prospective, non-experimental case-control study.","BACKGROUND: Diarrhoea still accounts for considerable mortality and morbidity worldwide. The highest burden is concentrated in tropical areas where populations lack access to clean water, adequate sanitation and hygiene. In contrast to acute diarrhoea (<14 days), the spectrum of pathogens that may give rise to persistent diarrhoea (>/=14 days) and persistent abdominal pain is poorly understood. It is conceivable that pathogens causing neglected tropical diseases play a major role, but few studies investigated this issue. Clinical management and diagnostic work-up of persistent digestive disorders in the tropics therefore remain inadequate. Hence, important aspects regarding the pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical symptomatology and treatment options for patients presenting with persistent diarrhoea and persistent abdominal pain should be investigated in multi-centric clinical studies. METHODS/DESIGN: This multi-country, prospective, non-experimental case-control study will assess persistent diarrhoea (>/=14 days; in individuals aged >/=1 year) and persistent abdominal pain (>/=14 days; in children/adolescents aged 1-18 years) in up to 2000 symptomatic patients and 2000 matched controls. Subjects from Cote d'Ivoire, Indonesia, Mali and Nepal will be clinically examined and interviewed using a detailed case report form. Additionally, each participant will provide a stool sample that will be examined using a suite of diagnostic methods (i.e., microscopic techniques, rapid diagnostic tests, stool culture and polymerase chain reaction) for the presence of bacterial and parasitic pathogens. Treatment will be offered to all infected participants and the clinical treatment response will be recorded. Data obtained will be utilised to develop patient-centred clinical algorithms that will be validated in primary health care centres in the four study countries in subsequent studies. DISCUSSION: Our research will deepen the understanding of the importance of persistent diarrhoea and related digestive disorders in the tropics. A diversity of intestinal pathogens will be assessed for potential associations with persistent diarrhoea and persistent abdominal pain. Different diagnostic methods will be compared, clinical symptoms investigated and diagnosis-treatment algorithms developed for validation in selected primary health care centres. The findings from this study will improve differential diagnosis and evidence-based clinical management of digestive syndromes in the tropics.

7554015,The effects of malnutrition on child mortality in developing countries.,"Conventional methods of classifying causes of death suggest that about 70% of the deaths of children (aged 0-4 years) worldwide are due to diarrhoeal illness, acute respiratory infection, malaria, and immunizable diseases. The role of malnutrition in child mortality is not revealed by these conventional methods, despite the long-standing recognition of the synergism between malnutrition and infectious diseases. This paper describes a recently-developed epidemiological method to estimate the percentage of child deaths (aged 6-59 months) which could be attributed to the potentiating effects of malnutrition in infectious disease. The results from 53 developing countries with nationally representative data on child weight-for-age indicate that 56% of child deaths were attributable to malnutrition's potentiating effects, and 83% of these were attributable to mild-to-moderate as opposed to severe malnutrition. For individual countries, malnutrition's total potentiating effects on mortality ranged from 13% to 66%, with at least three-quarters of this arising from mild-to-moderate malnutrition in each case. These results show that malnutrition has a far more powerful impact on child mortality than is generally appreciated, and suggest that strategies involving only the screening and treatment of the severely malnourished will do little to address this impact. The methodology provided in this paper makes it possible to estimate the effects of malnutrition on child mortality in any population for which prevalence data exist.","Pelletier DL, Frongillo EA Jr, Schroeder DG, Habicht JP",Bull World Health Organ,1995,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
26249024,Cyclospora cayetanensis infection in transplant traveller: a case report of outbreak.,"BACKGROUND: Cyclospora cayetanensis is a protozoan parasite causing intestinal infections. A prolonged course of infection is often observed in immunocompromised individuals. In Europe, less than 100 cases of C. cayetanensis infection have been reported to date, almost all of which being diagnosed in individuals after travelling abroad. FINDINGS: We described cases of three businessmen who developed acute traveller's diarrhoea after they returned to Poland from Indonesia. One of the travellers was a renal transplant recipient having ongoing immunosuppressive treatment. In each case, acute and prolonged diarrhoea and other intestinal disorders occurred. Oocysts of C. cayetanensis were identified in faecal smears of two of the travellers (one immunosuppressed and one immunocompetent). Diagnosis was confirmed by the successful amplification of parasite DNA (18S rDNA). A co-infection with Blastocystis hominis was identified in the immunocompetent man. CONCLUSIONS: Infection of C. cayetanensis shall be considered as the cause of prolonged acute diarrhoea in immunocompromised patients returning from endemic regions.","Bednarska M, Bajer A, Welc-Faleciak R, Pawelas A",Parasit Vectors,2015 Aug 7,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
39545201,"Molecular detection of Cryptosporidium spp. among wild rats in Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: Humans and animals who have an acute case of diarrhea can be infected with Cryptosporidium spp. Within the category of water-borne disease, it is a zoonotic disease. The zoonotic disease Cryptosporidium is among the several pathogens carried by wild rats (Rattus spp.). The risk of spreading this disease is rather significant in urban environments because rats are often close to people. AIM: This study aims to detect Cryptosporidium spp. infection in wild rats in Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia. METHODS: Through necropsy, a total of 100 wild rats' intestines were sampled for feces. Microscopic observation of the presence of Cryptosporidium was carried out using the float test with a combination of Ziehl Neelsen (ZN) staining. Molecular detection of Cryptosporidium spp. positive results used the Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) gene with polimerase chain reaction method. RESULTS: The results showed that 69 samples were positive for containing Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts and with ZN staining to confirm the diagnosis, the staining results showed Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts dark pink with a clear cavity inside with a percentage of 95.65% in Rattus norvegicus and 61.03% in Rattus tanezumi. In residential and densely populated environments the percentage of Cryptosporidium spp. amounted to 66.66% and in the market environment amounted to 74.19%. The percentage of Cryptosporidium spp. in the North Surabaya region was 42.85%, South Surabaya 100%, West Surabaya 37.5%, East Surabaya 81.39%, and Central Surabaya 65.38%. Molecular detection of Cryptosporidium spp. positive results were obtained using the COWP gene 550 bp. CONCLUSION: This study aims to detect Cryptosporidium spp. infection in wild rats in Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia. The high number of cases of cryptosporidiosis in wild rats has the potential to be a reservoir for the spread of the disease. The Cryptosporidium spp can detected with COWP in 550 bp in wild rats in Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia.","Suprihati E, Puspitasari H, Indasari EN, Galuh P, Suwanti LT, Mufasirin M, Hastutiek P, Setiawan B",Open Vet J,2024 Oct,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
15220940,Complex interactions with infection and diet may explain seasonal growth responses to vitamin A in preschool aged Indonesian children.,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential contribution of respiratory infections and vitamin A intakes to the seasonal effect of vitamin A supplementation on child growth. METHODS: Data from a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, in which a single high dose of vitamin A or placebo was given every 4 months to 1405 children aged 6-48 months were used for the analysis. In total, 4430 child-treatment cycles were examined, and for each cycle the children had their dietary intake, weight, and height assessed at the start and end. Linear regression models of the difference in height and weight during each treatment cycle were used and the within-child correlation was adjusted using the generalized estimating equations (GEE). Other covariables in the model included age, sex, percentage of days with acute lower respiratory infection and diarrhea, and cumulative doses of vitamin A. RESULTS: This study showed that a significant effect of vitamin A supplementation on linear growth was observed in all seasons in children with a low burden of respiratory infections, that is, < 21.5% of days with respiratory illness. In each season, the highest effect was found in children with a low burden of respiratory infections and low vitamin A intakes, that is, intakes < 400 RE/day. Children with a high burden of respiratory infections or high vitamin A intakes benefited less from vitamin A supplementation for their linear growth than children with a low burden of respiratory infections and low vitamin A intakes. Finally, there was no benefit for linear growth from vitamin A supplementation in children with both a high burden of respiratory infections and high vitamin A intakes regardless of the season. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of vitamin A supplementation on growth is dependent on season. Respiratory infections and vitamin A intakes are important factors underlying the seasonal effect of vitamin A supplementation on growth.","Hadi H, Dibley MJ, West KP Jr",Eur J Clin Nutr,2004 Jul,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia
8737434,Small group intervention vs formal seminar for improving appropriate drug use.,"In an attempt to evaluate the efficacy of different methods of interventions to improve the appropriate use of drugs for acute diarrhoea, a controlled study has been carried out in 6 districts in Yogyakarta and Central Java provinces, Indonesia. This study was designed to investigate the impacts of two different methods of educational intervention, i.e. a small group face-to-face intervention and a formal seminar for prescribers, on prescribing practice in acute diarrhoea. The districts were randomly assigned into 3 groups and 15 health centers were selected from each district. Prescribers in Group 1 underwent a small group face-to-face intervention conducted in the respective health center. Those in Group 2 attended a formal seminar conducted at the district level. Prescribers in Group 3 served as the control group. Both interventions were given on a single occasion without follow-up supervision or monitoring. Written information materials on the appropriate management of acute diarrhoea were developed and were provided to all prescribers in the intervention groups. Focus group discussions (FGDs) involving prescribers and consumers in the 6 districts were carried out to identify various underlying motivations of drug use in acute diarrhoea. The findings of the FGDs were used as part of the intervention materials. To evaluate the impacts of these interventions on prescribing practice, a prescribing survey for patients under five years old with acute diarrhoea was carried out in health centers covering 3-month periods before and after the intervention. The results showed that both interventions were equally effective in improving the levels of knowledge of prescribers about the appropriate management of acute diarrhoea. They were also partially effective in improving the appropriate use of drugs, reducing the use of non-rehydration medications. There was a highly significant reduction of antimicrobial usage either after small-group face-to-face intervention (77.4 +/- 2.7% to 60.4 +/- 2.9%; P < 0.001) or formal seminar (82.3 +/- 3.0% to 72.3 +/- 3.6%; P < 0.001), and the former caused significantly (P < 0.001) greater reduction than the latter. There was also a significant (P < 0.01) reduction in the usage of antidiarrhoeals after both interventions, i.e. from 20.3 +/- 3.7% to 12.5 +/- 3.3% (P < 0.01) after face-to-face intervention and from 48.5 +/- 4.1% to 27.0 +/- 4.3% (P < 0.01) after seminar. However, the formal seminar had a significantly (P < 0.01) greater impact than the small group face-to-face intervention. There was also a trend toward increased oral rehydration solution (ORS) usage after both interventions, but this did not achieve the level of statistical significance (P > 0.05). No changes were observed in the control group. Although the small group face-to-face intervention did not appear to offer greater impacts over large seminars in improving the appropriate use of drugs in acute diarrhoea, since the unit cost of training is far less costly than the seminar, it might be feasibly implemented in the existing supervisory structure of the health system.","Santoso B, Suryawati S, Prawaitasari JE",Soc Sci Med,1996 Apr,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia

16091096,"Rapid health assessment in Aceh Jaya District, Indonesia, following the December 26 tsunami.","OBJECTIVES: To rapidly determine the public health impact of the Asian tsunami on the population of three communities in Aceh Jaya District, Indonesia, and to prioritize health interventions. METHODS: Rapid health assessment, utilizing direct observations, interviews with key informants, a single focus group discussion, town mapping, a review of medical records and a systematic random sample of the entire town of Calang, capital of Aceh Jaya District, Indonesia. RESULTS: Almost 100% of dwellings were destroyed in all three communities. For the town of Calang: only 18.2% of the pre-tsunami population remained 2 weeks following the disaster, with an estimated 70% of the population having died at the time of impact; government estimates of the remaining population were inflated by approximately 250%; mortality rates were not elevated post-tsunami; 100% of the population lacked access to sanitation and clean water; 85% of children under 5 years reported diarrhoea over the preceding 2 week period; 95% of individuals with a medical complaint reported satisfactory access to clinical care; acute malnutrition was not a significant problem; and over one-fifth of households were hosting an orphan. For the villages of Rigah and Sayeung: approximately 46.2 and 86.0% of the population survived the tsunami impact, respectively; mortality rates were not elevated post tsunami; 100% of the population lacked access to sanitation and clean water; diarrhoea was the main cause of morbidity; primary care services were available only in Rigah; and only Rigah had received external assistance. CONCLUSIONS: Almost two-thirds of the population of the three communities died as a result of the tsunami's impact. Although mortality rates were not elevated post tsunami, significant threats to public health persisted, especially water-borne diseases. Priority activities included emergent environmental health interventions, mobile clinics to the two villages and a more detailed assessment of the needs of orphans.

31360099,Use of antibiotics for common illnesses among children aged under 5 years in a rural community in Indonesia: a cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of antimicrobial resistance has been increasing worldwide in the past decades, which includes resistance to bacteria that cause common childhood illnesses, such as acute respiratory infections and diarrhea. Numerous children with those common illnesses are treated with antibiotics. However, in such cases, antibiotic treatment is not required. Community-based studies focusing on antibiotic use among children are still limited. This study aimed to identify the prevalence of antibiotic use for common childhood illnesses and to investigate factors associated with antibiotic use in children under 5 years old as well as female caregivers in a rural community in Indonesia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 334 children in three villages of Banten Province, located in the western part of Java Island, was conducted in May 2018. Female caregivers who were responsible for providing medications to children were interviewed. We obtained information such as demographic data, any common clinical illness within the last 30 days, and antibiotic usage during an episode of illness. We excluded children with underlying disease that require a regular follow-up and children who were hospitalized in the last 30 days in the analysis. Antibiotic use answered by female caregivers was verified by checking its package or showing photos of various antibiotics to the female caregivers. Crushed antibiotics were confirmed with health professionals. RESULTS: A total of 203 children had clinical symptoms, and the most common symptom was fever and respiratory symptoms. In total, 49.3% received antibiotics, and 66% of them were prescribed by private health professionals. Only two children received antibiotics without a prescription. The most common antibiotic used among children was amoxicillin. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of antibiotic use was observed in children under 5 years of age, and the major source to obtain antibiotics was to consult health professionals. Training on appropriate antibiotic use must be conducted for health professionals in not only public but also private sectors.","Alkaff RN, Kamigaki T, Saito M, Ariyanti F, Iriani DU, Oshitani H",Trop Med Health,2019,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia

17381937,Breast-feeding Performance Index: a composite index to describe overall breast-feeding performance among infants under 6 months of age.,"OBJECTIVES: To develop a composite index to describe the overall breast-feeding performance of infants<6 months of age; and, using this index, to identify the factors associated with poor breast-feeding practices and the association between breast-feeding and infant morbidity. DESIGN, SETTING AND SUBJECTS: The 2003 Demographic and Health Survey was a multi-stage cluster sample survey of 4320 households in Timor-Leste which covered 573 infants aged<6 months. Breast-feeding Performance Index (BPI) was constructed by allocating one point for each of seven infant feeding practices: first suckling within an hour of birth; absence of prelacteals; non-use of feeding bottles; current breast-feeding; not receiving liquids; not receiving formula or other milk; and not receiving solids in the last 24 hours. BPI was treated as the dependent variable in univariate and multivariate analyses to identify the factors associated with poor breast-feeding. RESULTS: Exclusive breast-feeding rate was 29.9%. The BPI (mean 4.4, standard deviation 1.77) was categorised as low, average and high according to tertiles. Multivariate analysis indicated that infants from the richest households were 1.70 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-2.77) times more likely to have 'low BPI' than the poorest. Maternal BMI<18.5 kg m(-2) was predictive of poor breast-feeding (odds ratio=1.79; 95% CI 1.27-2.52). In the 'low' BPI group, the incidence of diarrhoea (13.4%) and acute respiratory infections (20.7%) during the previous two weeks was significantly higher than in 'average' (4.3 and 9.3%) and 'high' BPI groups (4.6 and 5.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Creating a composite index to assess the overall breast-feeding performance among infants<6 months of age is feasible. BPI can be effectively used to identify target groups for breast-feeding promotion interventions.","Senarath U, Dibley MJ, Agho KE",Public Health Nutr,2007 Oct,Acute Diarrhea AND Indonesia

During 2013-2021, annual reported measles incidence decreased by 95%, from 33.2 to 1.4 cases per million population; reported rubella incidence decreased 89%, from 9.3 to 1.0 cases per million population. However, a large surge in measles and rubella cases occurred in 2022, with a reported measles incidence of 29 cases per million and a reported rubella incidence of 3 per million, primarily related to disruption in immunization services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, approximately 26 million children (an estimated 73% of the target population) received a combined measles- and rubella-containing vaccine during supplementary immunization activities completed in 32 provinces. Progress toward measles and rubella elimination in Indonesia has been made; however, continued and urgent efforts are needed to restore routine immunization services that were adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and close immunity gaps to accelerate progress toward measles and rubella elimination.","Chacko S, Kamal M, Hastuti EB, Mildya F, Kelyombar C, Voronika V, Yosephine P, Tandy G, Anisiska D, Karolina S, Dewi LA, Khanal S, Bahl S, Wijayanti F, Merrill RD, Hsu CH, Morales M",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,2023 Oct 20,Measles AND Indonesia
33189503,"Religion and Measles Vaccination in Indonesia, 1991-2017.","INTRODUCTION: Some Muslim religious councils in Indonesia have ruled that measles vaccines contain haram (i.e., forbidden materials). This study evaluates the changes in measles vaccination coverage between 1991 and 2017 and compares vaccination coverage between Muslims and non-Muslims in Indonesia. METHODS: A total of 7 cross-sectional in-person surveys of mothers in 1991-2017 in Indonesia were analyzed in 2019. Participants were asked about religion in 1991-2007, and 100 data sets of religion were imputed for 2012 and 2017. In this multiple imputation analysis, binomial regression models output prevalence differences adjusted for wealth, education, child's sex, and mother's age. A quadratic term for year (year X year) and an interaction term between year and religion evaluated changes in vaccination over time by religion. RESULTS: The 7 data sets included 23,106 children aged 12-23 months, with the proportion of those who were Muslims ranging between 85% and 89% across the survey years. Between 1991 and 2017, measles vaccination coverage increased from 57% to 79% among non-Muslims and from 59% to 79% among Muslims. In the multivariable regression model, measles vaccination coverage increased by 1.6% each year (with a quadratic term of -0.05%, indicating some leveling over time). At baseline in 1991, non-Muslims had a vaccination coverage of 6.2% higher than that of Muslims, but this disparity decreased by -0.2% each year. CONCLUSIONS: Measles vaccination increased in both Muslims and non-Muslims in Indonesia but has stagnated in recent years. Because of increased attention among Muslim groups on haram materials in vaccines since 2017, future studies should continue to examine the relationship between religion and vaccine uptake in Indonesia.

37099966,When religion prevails: examining religious and mainstream news coverage of measles-rubella vaccination in Indonesia.,"OBJECTIVES: Indonesia's measles-rubella (MR) vaccination campaign faced public refusal due to religious objections. The government then lobbied the religious organization to issue a decree to permit the consumption of the MR vaccine, which would enhance public approval. Media outlets, including religious and mainstream media, played a crucial role in promoting the decree and the vaccine. Learning from this MR vaccination campaign in 2018, this study examined how the mainstream and alternative or religious media framed the MR vaccination and how it changed before and after the decree. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: A content analysis was performed on 234 news articles from Indonesian religious and mainstream media. RESULTS: Mainstream media positively framed MR vaccines, which were further amplified after the decree was issued. In contrast, religious media consistently depicted the opposing sides of the vaccine and its campaign. Both media types also predominantly cited the government and religious leaders in their articles. CONCLUSION: While the mainstream media agenda aligns with the national agenda to promote the MR vaccine, religious media still emphasizes the risk of the vaccine. The prevalence of religious leaders in alternative media also suggests that the public, including religious leaders, may not necessarily accept the decree. Hence, more effort should be devoted to encouraging the media and religious leaders to accept the vaccine, as they may act as opinion leaders.","Oktavianus J, Dewi HLC",Public Health,2023 Jun,Measles AND Indonesia
36333713,Childhood immunization and age-appropriate vaccinations in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Childhood immunization is a cost-effective way to protect individuals against communicable diseases. However, although there is a large literature on childhood immunization in Indonesia, there is a paucity of research on the age-appropriateness on measles and DTwP-3 vaccination, and the inequities in immunization coverage across Indonesia. METHODS: In this paper, using seven waves of data from the nationally representative Indonesia Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) covering the period 1991- 2017, we empirically analyse the socio-economic and demographic factors influencing the uptake of four routine vaccines (BCG, Polio-3, DTwP-3, and Measles). Specifically, using multivariate regression analysis, we identify the socio-economic and demographic factors influencing childhood immunization coverage. We further analyse the socio-economic and demographic correlates of the age-appropriateness of the measles and DTwP-3 vaccination coverage. RESULTS: Our findings show that parental education and use of healthcare services are strong predictors of full immunization and age-appropriate vaccinations. This study also finds evidence of spatial heterogeneity in both full immunization rates and age-appropriate vaccinations for measles and DTwP-3 vaccines. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis finds that despite an improvement in the timing of vaccinations over the last two decades, a significant proportion of children continue to receive their measles and DTwP vaccinations age inappropriately. In particular, we find that maternal education and maternal engagement with healthcare services are critical in improving age appropriateness of vaccinations. From a policy perspective, these results call for concerted efforts by policy makers to address regional gaps in access to health services and immunization coverage, as well as to improve the age-appropriateness of vaccination.","Chu H, Rammohan A",BMC Public Health,2022 Nov 5,Measles AND Indonesia
21771439,Correlates of first dose of measles vaccination delivery and uptake in Indonesia.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine health systems-related, familial, and cultural factors which influence the delivery and uptake of measles vaccination in Indonesia. METHODS: Logistic regression analysis of data collected during the 2007 Indonesian Demographic and Health Survey was undertaken by the authors to investigate these factors. The 2007 Indonesian Demographic and Health Survey dataset is a nationally representative, randomly sampled survey containing 15 065 children aged between 9 and 59 months. RESULTS: 72.8% of children had received the measles vaccine. Vaccination coverage was similar for males and females; however, coverage was higher amongst urban children, 80.1%, compared to 68.5% in rural areas. The key findings of the regression analysis were congruent with the results of previous research targeting vaccination coverage. After controlling for all other factors, maternal age, maternal education, wealth, the use of a skilled birth attendant, and postnatal check-ups were positively and significantly (P< 0.01) correlated with measles vaccination. The number of children per household was negatively correlated (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In order to enhance measles vaccination coverage in Indonesia, delivery to, and uptake by, rural and low socio-economic populations require substantial improvements. Mass health education and health systems improvements are also required.","Fernandez R, Rammohan A, Awofeso N",Asian Pac J Trop Med,2011 Feb,Measles AND Indonesia
63364,Xerophthalmia and measles in Kenya.,"In many African countries measles is considered to be an important cause of blindness. On the basis of his observations in Kenya and Tanzania in 1972 Franken presumed, however, that in the majority of these cases xerophthalmia was the real cause of blindness, precipitated by the ""catalyst"" measles. In order to gain a better understanding of this important complicated problem, we performed in the first half of 1974 an investigation in Kenya into the prevalence of xerophthalmia. In December 1974 we had the opportunity to evaluate our Kenyan findings on Java, in the company of Dr. J. ten Doesschate and Professor H.A.P.C. Oomen. The results of this investigation in Kenya and Indonesia are presented in this thesis. (see article) 1. Xerophthalmia occurred nearly everywhere in Kenya in 1974. This demonstrates the prevalence of xerophthalmia in communities which - do not have rice but - have maize for their staplefood. 2. Xerophthalmia appears to be the main cause of blindness in Kenyan children. 3. Measles often plays - by means of local and general ""catalysing"" effects - an important role in the development of blindness caused by xerophthalmia. 4. In well-nourished children measles is of no consequence as a cause of blindness. 5. Vital staining by 1% rose bengal or 1% lissamine green appears to be a real asset for the early diagnosis of xerophthalmia in Health Centres and in field surveys. This method is therefore of great importance for the prevention of severe, blindness inducing vitamin A deficiency.","Jacques J, Sauter M",Doc Ophthalmol,1976 Oct 15,Measles AND Indonesia
39340113,Estimates of Potential Demand for Measles and Rubella Microarray Patches.,"Global measles vaccine coverage has stagnated at approximately 85% for over a decade. By simplifying vaccine logistics and administration, the measles and rubella microarray patch (MR-MAP) may improve coverage. Clinical trials have demonstrated similar safety and immunogenicity in 9-month-old infants for MR-MAPs compared with syringe-and-needle vaccination. To aid commercialization, we present estimates of MR-MAP demand. We created a spreadsheet-based tool to estimate demand for MR-MAPs using data from 180 WHO countries during 2000-2016. Five immunization scenarios were analyzed: (1a) Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) in Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi)-eligible countries and (1b) WHO countries where preventive SIAs are routinely conducted; (2) SIAs and outbreak response immunization in all WHO countries; (3) routine immunization (RI) and SIAs in six high-burden measles countries (the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Pakistan); (4) RI and SIAs in six high-burden countries and Gavi-eligible countries; and (5) hard-to-reach populations. MR-MAP demand varied greatly across scenarios. Forecasts for 2025-2034 estimate from 137 million doses in hard-to-reach populations (scenario 5) to 2.587 billion doses for RI and SIAs in six high-burden countries and Gavi-eligible countries (scenario 4). When policymakers and manufacturers assess MR-MAP demand, they may consider multiple scenarios to allow for a complete consideration of potential markets and public health needs.","Kayembe LK, Fischer LS, Adhikari BB, Knapp JK, Khan EB, Greening BR, Papania M, Meltzer MI",Vaccines (Basel),2024 Sep 23,Measles AND Indonesia
26400063,"Measles surveillance in Taiwan, 2012-2014: Changing epidemiology, immune response, and circulating genotypes.","In Taiwan, although the coverage rate of two doses of measles-containing vaccine has been maintained at over 95% since 2001, measles outbreaks occurred in 2002, 2009, and 2011. The present study reports that 43 cases were confirmed by laboratory testing in Taiwan in 2012-2014 and that adults have emerged as one of groups susceptible to measles virus (MV) infection, who may have discrepant humoral immune reactions--indicated by the level of IgM and IgG antibodies compared to a naive, susceptible measles case. Thirty-seven of 43 cases confirmed by RT-PCR were further characterized by genotyping. In Taiwan, genotype H1 was the major strain in circulation prior to 2010, while D9 was the most frequently detected MV genotype between 2010 and 2011. The genotyping data collected between 2012 and 2014 revealed that H1 rebounded in 2012 after an absence in 2011 and was imported from China and Vietnam. In 2014, genotype B3 first appeared in Taiwan following import from the Philippines and became the most frequently detected strain. Genotype D8, linked to importation from various countries, including India, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam, showed sequence divergence. D9 was imported from Malaysia in 2014. The MV genotypes detected in Taiwan reflected the genotypes of circulating endemic measles strains in neighboring countries. A significant rise in the number of measles cases and in measles with genotypes imported from surrounding countries indicated that measles resurged in Asia in 2014.","Cheng WY, Wang HC, Wu HS, Liu MT",J Med Virol,2016 May,Measles AND Indonesia
35953251,Factors affecting vaccination demand in Indonesia: a secondary analysis and multimethods national assessment.,"OBJECTIVES: Vaccine hesitancy remains a major barrier to immunisation coverage worldwide. We explored influence of hesitancy on coverage and factors contributing to vaccine uptake during a national measles-rubella (MR) campaign in Indonesia. DESIGN: Secondary analyses of qualitative and quantitative data sets from existing cross-sectional studies conducted during and around the campaign. METHODS: Quantitative data used in this assessment included daily coverage reports generated by health workers, district risk profiles that indicate precampaign immunisation programme performance, and reports of campaign cessation due to vaccine hesitancy. We used t-test and chi(2) tests for associations. The qualitative assessment employed three parallel national and regional studies. Deductive thematic analysis examined factors for acceptance among caregivers, health providers and programme managers. RESULTS: Coverage data were reported from 6462 health facilities across 395 districts from 1 August to 31 December 2018. The average district coverage was 73%, with wide variation between districts (2%-100%). One-third of districts fell below 70% coverage thresholds. Sixty-two of 395 (16%) districts paused the campaign due to hesitancy. Coverage among districts that never paused campaign activities due to hesitancy was significantly higher than rates for districts ever-pausing the campaign (81% vs 42%; p<0.001). Precampaign adequacy of district immunisation programmes did not explain coverage gaps (p=0.210). Qualitative analysis identified acceptance enablers including using digital health monitoring and feedback systems, increasing caregiver knowledge and awareness, making immunisation social norm, effective cross-sectoral collaboration, conducive service environment and positive experiences for mothers and children. Barriers included misinformation diffusion on social media, halal-haram issues, lack of healthcare provider knowledge, negative family influences and traditions, previous poor experiences and misinformation on adverse events. CONCLUSION: Barriers to vaccine uptake contributed to coverage gaps during national MR campaign in Indonesia. A range of supply-related and demand-related strategies were identified to address hesitancy contributors. Advancing a portfolio of tailored multilevel interventions will be critical to enhance vaccine acceptance.","Jusril H, Rachmi CN, Amin MR, Dynes M, Sitohang V, Untung ASB, Damayanti R, Ariawan I, Pronyk PM",BMJ Open,2022 Aug 11,Measles AND Indonesia
39591161,Measles-Rubella Microarray Patches Phase III Clinical Trial Framework: Proposal and Considerations.,"Background: The Measles-Rubella Microarray Patch (MR-MAP) is an important technology that is expected to reduce coverage and equity gaps for measles-containing vaccines (MCVs), reach zero-dose children, and contribute to elimination of measles and rubella. MR-MAPs are anticipated to be easier to deploy programmatically and could be delivered by lesser-trained health workers, thereby increasing immunization coverage. The most advanced MR-MAP has reached clinical proof-of-concept through a Phase I/II trial in the target population of infants and young children. The World Health Organization (WHO) and partners have developed the Phase III clinical trial framework for MR-MAPs presented in this article. Objectives and Methods: The purpose of such framework is to inform the considerations, design and approach for the pivotal clinical trial design, while considering the anticipated data requirements to inform regulatory approval, WHO prequalification, and policy decision. Results: The proposed Phase III trial would compare the immunogenicity and safety of an MR-MAP with MR vaccine delivered subcutaneously in 9- to 10-month-old infants. An analysis of non-inferiority (NI) of immunogenicity would occur six weeks after the first dose. Should regulatory agencies or policy makers require, a proportion of infants could receive a second dose of either the same or alternate MR vaccine presentation six months after the first dose, with those children returning six weeks after the second dose for a descriptive assessment of immunogenicity, and then followed up six months after the second dose for evaluation of safety and immunogenicity. It is anticipated that this proposed pivotal Phase III trial framework would generate the required clinical data for regulatory licensure and WHO prequalification (PQ) of MR-MAPs. However, the trial design would need to be reviewed and confirmed by a national regulatory authority (NRA) that will assess the product for regulatory licensure and the WHO PQ team. Additional research will likely be required to generate data on concomitant vaccine delivery, the safety and immunogenicity of MR-MAPs in other age groups such as children 1-5 years and infants younger than 9 months of age, and the impact of MR-MAPs on coverage and equity. Such studies could be conducted during or after clinical MR-MAP development.","Zehrung D, Innis BL, Suwantika AA, Ameri M, Biellik R, Birchall JC, Cravioto A, Jarrahian C, Fairlie L, Goodson JL, Kochhar S, Kretsinger K, Morgan C, Mvundura M, Rathi N, Clarke E, Mistilis JJ, Uwamwezi MC, Giersing B, Hasso-Agopsowicz M",Vaccines (Basel),2024 Nov 6,Measles AND Indonesia
39340114,"Exploring Important Attributes, the Potential Use Cases and Feasibility of Introduction of Measles and Rubella Microarray Patches (MR-MAPs): Insights from Nine Countries.","Background: Microarray patches (MAPs) are innovative, needle-free vaccine delivery systems, suitable for administration by minimally trained health care workers or trained community health workers. Their introduction may transform immunization programmes, particularly for vaccines where high coverage is required for population immunity, such as measles, and where vaccine delivery is challenging, such as in low- and middle-income countries. Recognizing the need to understand how best to tailor these products to reflect country priorities, workshops on measles and rubella MAPs (MR-MAPs) were conducted in multiple regions to collect insights on needs and preferences from relevant stakeholders at country level. Methods: The CAPACITI Innovation Framework was used to structure stakeholder discussions in nine countries in the period from August 2022 to July 2023. The discussions, building on the findings from a situation analysis on the barriers related to measles and rubella vaccine delivery, followed the four-step process outlined in the framework. Results: Key barriers hindering delivery of measles and rubella vaccines across the countries were in the categories of human resource management, service delivery, and demand generation. MR-MAP attributes that stakeholders believed would reduce or eliminate these barriers included ease of preparation and administration, improved thermostability, fewer (ancillary) components, and single-dose presentation. Some attributes such as the site of administration, wear time, and storage volume could exacerbate certain barriers. Based on an understanding of key barriers, product attributes, and underserved populations, stakeholders identified several potential use cases for MR-MAPs: (i) delivery at a fixed health post, (ii) delivery through outreach sessions conducted by health workers, and (iii) administration by community health workers. To enable robust national decision making about the introduction of MR-MAPs and successful implementation, global and national evidence on feasibility and acceptability of MR-MAPs should be generated. To prepare for the potential introduction of MR-MAPs, immunization programmes should evaluate their immunization policies based on their preferred use cases and modify them if needed, for example, to enable community health workers to administer vaccines, along with making programmatic adjustments to waste management and training. Conclusions: MR-MAPs have the potential to reduce key barriers to MR delivery. Yet, their future impact depends on the ability of global stakeholders to steer the development of MR-MAPs to be responsive to country needs and preferences. The generation of evidence to enable robust decision making, timely modification of vaccine policies, and addressing programmatic considerations will be key to successful uptake.","Hasso-Agopsowicz M, Spasenoska D, Jansen MPM, Masresha BG, Pastor D, Gebrekidan AH, Silalahi O, Woolford J, Kisakye A, Kahn AL, Giersing B",Vaccines (Basel),2024 Sep 23,Measles AND Indonesia
33938206,Analysis of specific antibody and cellular immune response to first-dose measles vaccine Edmonston-Zagreb in 9-month-old infants.,"BACKGROUND: Measles vaccinations have been suggested to provide immune protection and decreased measles incidence. However, there was a limited study evaluating how the measles vaccine elicits specific immune responses. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate both humoral and cellular immunity to first-dose measles vaccine Edmonston-Zagreb (EZ) in 9-month-old Indonesian infants. METHODS: A cohort study was conducted on 9-month-old infants who got the first-dose of measles vaccine EZ. Measles-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody serum levels were measured using plaque-reduction microneutralization assay. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with a measles-specific peptide to identify a cellular immune response. Quantification of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells producing interferon-gamma (IFN-ɣ) and interleukin 17-A (IL-17A) were conducted by flow cytometry. Humoral and cellular immune response parameters were analyzed over time. RESULTS: The prevalence of seropositivity rates was 85.8% at 1-month after vaccination and 16.67% at 6-months postvaccination. Measles-specific IgG antibodies increased significantly at 1-month after measles vaccination. However, they decreased significantly 6-months after vaccination. IFN-ɣ and IL-17A secreting T-cells increased significantly at 1-month after measles vaccination. Interestingly, a significant decrease of IFN-ɣ and IL-17A secreting CD4(+) T cells was noticed 6-months postvaccination compared to IFN-ɣ and IL-17A secreting CD8(+) T cells. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the first-dose measles vaccine on 9-months-old infants seems to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses that decline 6-months after vaccination.","Hr TN, Barlianto W, Wiyasa IWA, Kusuma HMSC, Sari TL, Bachtiar NS",Allergol Immunopathol (Madr),2021,Measles AND Indonesia
34609101,"Congenital Rubella Syndrome Surveillance After Measles Rubella Vaccination Introduction in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) is a fatal disease causing severe congenital defects. Indonesia had the highest CRS cases in the world in 2016 with a commitment to achieve elimination of rubella disease by 2020, through the campaign and introduction of measles rubella (MR) national vaccination program in 2017 and 2018. This study aimed to describe the impact of the national vaccination campaign by conducting surveillance of CRS cases and comparing the incidence of new CRS cases before and after the MR vaccination campaign. METHODS: From July 2015 to July 2020, we conducted surveillance of CRS in Yogyakarta. Suspected patients underwent complete clinical examinations. Serology was tested for the presence of IgM and IgG antibodies against rubella. Descriptive analysis was used to characterize the demographic and clinical characteristics of the cases before and after the MR vaccination campaign. RESULTS: The study involved 229 infants who were suspected for CRS. Laboratory-confirmed cases were found in 47 of them (20.86%). Most of the laboratory-confirmed cases (55.3%) were reported among 1-5 months old infants. Common clinical features among laboratory-confirmed cases included structural heart defects in 43 (91.4%). There was a significant decrease (60.9%) of CRS incidence from 0.39 per 1000 live births in the precampaign era to 0.08 in the postcampaign era (P = 0.00). CONCLUSION: There has been a significant declining number of CRS cases based on pre- and post-MR vaccination campaign in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. An effective surveillance system will help monitor the number of CRS cases.","Herini ES, Triono A, Iskandar K, Prasetyo A, Nugrahanto AP, Gunadi",Pediatr Infect Dis J,2021 Dec 1,Measles AND Indonesia
36746316,Overview of the role and action mechanism of microRNA-128 in viral infections.,"Recently in vivo and in vitro studies have provided evidence establishing the significance of microRNAs (miRNAs) in both physiological and pathological conditions. In this regard, the role of miRNA-128 (miR-128) in health and diseases has been found, and its critical regulatory role in the context of some viral diseases has been recently identified. For instance, it has been found that miR-128 can serve as an antiviral mediator and significantly limit the replication and dissemination of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Besides, it has been noted that poliovirus receptor-related 4 (PVRL4) is post-transcriptionally regulated by miR-128, representing possible miRNA targets that can modulate measles virus infection. Of note, the downregulation of seminal exosomes eca-miR-128 is associated with the long-term persistence of Equine arteritis virus (EAV) in the reproductive tract, and this particular miRNA is a putative regulator of chemokine ligand 16 (C-X-C motif) as determined by target prediction analysis. In this review, the latest information on the role and action mechanism of miR-128 in viral infections will be summarized and discussed in detail.","Alshahrani SH, Alameri AA, Kahar F, Alexis Ramirez-Coronel A, Fadhel Obaid R, Alsaikhan F, Zabibah RS, Qasim QA, Altalbawy FMA, Fakri Mustafa Y, Mirzaei R, Karampoor S",Microb Pathog,2023 Mar,Measles AND Indonesia
10803001,Pediatric diseases and operational deployments.,"Many nations now export military health as a proactive arm of the nation's contribution to the maintenance of international peace in trouble regions of the world; and all nations are called upon from time to time in emergency and disaster situations to help out in their regions of interest. Children and young teenagers constitute some 50% of war-stricken populations. This paper explores this increasingly important role of military medicine from the point of view of a practicing pediatrician and career doctor-soldier. Many international operational deployments undertaken in the last 5 years have required the insertion of pediatric clinical and preventive health resources. Deployments to Rwanda, the countries of the former Yugoslavia, Somalia, Bougainville (in Papua New Guinea), Irian Jaya (in Indonesia), and the Aitape tsunami disaster response (the Sepik region of Papua New Guinea) have all necessitated major pediatric interventions. In some operational deployments, in excess of one-third of patient and clinical contacts have involved the care of children, including clinical treatments ranging from life-saving resuscitation to the care of children with both tropical and subtropical illnesses. They have also involved mass immunization campaigns (e.g., in Rwanda) to prevent measles and meningococcal septicemia. In developing countries, at any time approximately 1 to 4 teenage and adult women is pregnant; and of these, 1 in 15 is suffering a miscarriage during any 2-week period. The implications of this audit are that service members must be multi-skilled not only in the traditional aspects of military medicine and nursing but also in (a) the developmental aspects of childhood; (b) the prevention of infectious childhood diseases by immunization and other means; (c) the recognition and management of diseases of childhood; and (d) the management of the normal neonate and infant, especially those orphaned in refugee disaster and other emergency situations. Doctor-soldiers hold special credentials to be advocates for the protection of children caught up in armed conflict and its aftermath. In this context, advocacy to ban anti-personnel land mines is topical, because unfortunately the more than 2,000 deaths and injuries each month involve children and their families, often injured long after the cessation of hostilities. Pediatric issues are now the business of all who serve in the health disciplines in the broader profession of arms.",Pearn J,Mil Med,2000 Apr,Measles AND Indonesia

Even though vaccination has been claimed victorious to reduce the transmission, but it does not mean that the world is free from Measles. GIS is offering a powerful method to support the decision maker in generating the Measles program. AIM: This research aimed to investigate Measles clustering in Bantul, Yogyakarta, Indonesia by considering population density and income level. This study was essential to support decision maker to develop a proper intervention for preventing Measles. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Quantitative approach was used in this study. Secondary data that consisted of measles cases, population density and income level were collected from the district health office and related government office in Bantul District. Ordinal Scan Statistic Model by using SaTScan v9.6 was applied to detect the cluster and to test the association between the cases and the variables. RESULTS: This research revealed that population density and income level are the two predictors of Measles hotspot cluster. People who live in the very high-income level district will have 4.8 higher possibility to be exposed with Measles. People who live in the district with medium and high population density predicted to have 4.5 fewer risks to be infected with Measles. CONCLUSION: There is a correlation between income level and Measles cases. Geographic Information System (GIS) can contribute to a decision support system for disease prevention such as on Measles.","Sulistyawati S, Sumiana S",Mater Sociomed,2018 Dec,Measles AND Indonesia

Several studies have reported the successful application of mumps-measles-rubella (MMR) vaccine resulting in clearance of warts via immunomodulation and induction of immune system. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive search on the role of intralesional MMR in warts from several electronic databases. Complete response is defined as complete clearance of warts lesion. RESULTS: There were a total of 425 subjects from five studies. Intralesional injection of MMR was associated with an increased complete response (OR 9.43 [5.78, 15.37], p < .001; I(2): 5%, p = .38). Subgroup analysis on patients receiving injection for every 2 weeks for a maximum of five injections revealed an OR of 11.70 [6.40, 21.38], p < .001; I(2): 20%, p = .29. Patients receiving intralesional MMR were associated with a lower partial response (OR 0.54 [0.33, 0.88], p = .01; I(2): 0%, p = .66). Intralesional MMR was associated with a reduced no-response (OR 0.16 [0.06, 0.43], p < .001; I(2): 69%, p = .01). Funnel plot analysis for complete response was asymmetrical, indicating the risk of publication bias. There were statistically significant small-study effects for intralesional MMR on complete response upon analysis using Harbord's test (p = .047). Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) assessment showed that intralesional MMR injection has high level of certainty (quality of evidence) for complete response in warts with an absolute increase of 505 per 1000. CONCLUSION: Intralesional MMR injection was associated with a higher complete response and lower no-response with a high level of certainty.","Vania R, Pranata R, Tan ST",J Dermatolog Treat,2021 Dec,Measles AND Indonesia
32987513,"Investigation of a measles transmission with vaccination: a case study in Jakarta, Indonesia.","Measles is a contagious disease caused by the measles virus of genus Morbillivirus, which has been spreading in many affected regions. This infection is characterized by the appearance of rashes all over the body and potentially cause serious complications, especially among infants and children. Before measles immunization was promoted, it is one of the endemic diseases that caused the most fatalities each year in the world. This paper aims to analyze and to investigate measles transmission in Jakarta via an SIHR epidemic model involving vaccination from January to December 2017. Jakarta Health Office collected the observed data of measles incidence. We then derived the basic reproduction number as a threshold of disease transmission and obtained the local as well as global stability of the equilibria under certain conditions. The unobserved parameters and initial conditions were estimated by minimizing errors between data and numerical results. Furthermore, a stochastic model was developed to capture the data and to accommodate the randomness of the transmission. Sensitivity analysis was also performed to analyze and to identify the parameters which give significant contributions to the spread of the virus. We then obtained simulations of vaccine level coverage. The data is shown within a 95% confidence interval of the stochastic solutions, and the average of the stochastic solutions is relatively close to the solution of the deterministic model. The most sensitive parameter in the infected compartment is the hospitalized rate, which can be considered to be one of the essential factors to reduce the number of cases for policymakers. We hence proposed a control strategy which is providing treatment accesses easier for infected individuals is better than vaccinating when an outbreak occurs.","Fakhruddin M, Suandi D, Sumiati S, Fahlena H, Nuraini N, Soewono E",Math Biosci Eng,2020 Apr 1,Measles AND Indonesia
37550702,Inequity of maternal-child health services in ASEAN member states from 1993 to 2021.,"INTRODUCTION: Inequity in maternal-child health services is a challenge to global health as it hinders the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Universal Health Coverage. Though the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has made remarkable achievements in maternal-child health, there remain gaps in reaching global goals. This study aimed to compare and investigate the inequity in maternal-child health (MCH) services in ASEAN member states to help guide policy decisions to improve equitable health services in the SDG era and beyond. METHODS: Using the WHO Health Inequality Monitor, we identified inequity summary measures for five MCH services in ASEAN member states from 1993 to 2021: antenatal care, births attended by skilled health personnel, diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP3) immunization, measles immunization, and polio immunization. We divided the analysis dimension of inequity into urban-rural inequity, economic status inequity, and sub-regional inequity. Trends of absolute and relative inequity in every dimension of MCH services in ASEAN member states were examined with the principal component analysis (PCA). RESULTS: The mean coverages of MCH services are 98.80% (Thailand), 86.72% (Cambodia), 84.54% (Viet Nam), 78.52 (Indonesia), 76.94% (Timor-Leste), 72.40% (Lao PDR), 68.10% (Philippines) and 48.52% (Myanmar) in 2021. Thailand have the lowest MCH services absolute inequity indexes of -1.945, followed by Vietnam (-1.449). Lao PDR and Myanmar have relatively higher MCH services absolute inequity indexes of 0.852 and 0.054 respectively. The service in Cambodia, Indonesia, and the Philippines is pro-specific regions (with subnational region absolute inequity indexes of -0.02, 0.01, and 1.01 respectively). The service in Myanmar is pro-rich (with economic status absolute inequity index of 0.43). The service in Lao PDR and Timor-Leste is pro-urban areas, pro-rich, and pro-specific regions. CONCLUSION: The inequity of MCH services in ASEAN persists but is in a declining trend. Thailand and Vietnam have performed well in ensuring MCH services equity, while Laos and Myanmar are still facing serious inequity dilemmas. The progress of MCH service equity in Myanmar, Cambodia, the Philippines, and Indonesia is uneven. It is acceptable to learn from the successful experiences of Thailand and Vietnam to improve the equities in other ASEAN countries. Policies should be developed according to the specific types of MCH inequity in member states to improve equity levels.","Feng Y, Maimaitiming M, Shi J, Wang M, Li N, Jin Y, Zheng ZJ",Int J Equity Health,2023 Aug 7,Measles AND Indonesia
38020581,"A Case of Genital and Extragenital Warts Unresponsive to Immunotherapy Using Measles, Mumps, Rubella Vaccine.","Anogenital warts (AGWs) are globally recognized as the most common sexually transmitted infections (STIs) caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), particularly types 6 and 11. Meanwhile, immunotherapy is one of the treatments of choice for patients with extensive AGWs. Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine induce the production of various T helper 1 cytokines to elicit immune responses, resulting in the clearance of both treated and untreated warts. This study reported a case of extensive genital and extragenital warts in a 53-year-old male which had occurred for five years, with no pseudo-Koebner phenomenon. The history of MMR vaccination was uncertain but the patient received oral antibiotics for one week, one month before seeking consultation. Physical examination showed extensive verrucous and hyperkeratotic papules, plaques, and nodules in the lower abdomen, pubic, inguinal, genital, and gluteal regions. Acetowhite test results were positive, while polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results were positive for HPV types 6 and 11. The patient received an intralesional injection of 0.5 mL MMR vaccine into the largest warts with a 3-week interval. However, during the one-month follow-up after the third injection, no improvement was observed in either the size or number of warts. Based on the results, several factors must be considered to determine the best candidate for immunotherapy, particularly with MMR vaccine, to achieve an optimal outcome. These factors include the active state of diseases, duration of diseases, as well as a history of sensitization, and broad-spectrum antibiotics.","Achdiat PA, Yunitasari, Usman HA, Maharani RH",Int Med Case Rep J,2023,Measles AND Indonesia
17709582,Causes and temporal trends of childhood blindness in Indonesia: study at schools for the blind in Java.,"AIMS: To ascertain the causes of blindness and severe visual impairment (BL/SVI) in schools for the blind in Java, to identify preventable and treatable causes and to evaluate temporal trends in the major causes. METHODS: From a total of 504 students, 479 were examined. Data was collected using a modified World Heath Organization Prevention of Blindness (WHO/PBL) eye examination record for children. RESULTS: The majority of the students (95%) were blind and 4.6% were severely visually impaired. The major anatomical site of BL/SVI was whole globe in 35.9%, retina in 18.9%, lens in 16.4% and cornea in 16.1%. The major underlying aetiology of BL/SVI was undetermined/unknown in 32.7% (mainly microphthalmia, anterior segment dysgenesis and cataract), hereditary factors 31.9% (mainly retinal dystrophies), and childhood disorders 28.5%. Avoidable causes of BL/SVI accounted for 59.9% of the total students, whereas measles blindness was the underlying condition for 23.1% of the preventable causes; cataract and glaucoma accounted for 15.5% and 8.2% of the treatable causes, respectively. Exploration on trends of SVI/BL among two different age groups <16 years and > or = 16 years suggested that childhood disorders and corneal factors have declined, while hereditary disorders have increased. Optic nerve disorder, although not counted as a major cause of blindness, seems to be on the increase. CONCLUSIONS: More than half of the BL/SVI causes are potentially avoidable. Cataract and corneal disorders related to measles or vitamin A deficiency were the major treatable and preventable causes. Declining proportions of childhood factors and corneal disorders over a period of 10-20 years could reflect improved vitamin A supplementation and measles vaccination coverage in Indonesia. This finding, and the increased proportion of hereditary disease causes, could suggest improving levels of socioeconomic development and health care services.","Sitorus RS, Abidin MS, Prihartono J",Br J Ophthalmol,2007 Sep,Measles AND Indonesia
21899375,Determinants of apparent rural-urban differentials in measles vaccination uptake in Indonesia.,"INTRODUCTION: Regional differences in vaccination uptake are common in both developed and developing countries, and are often linked to the availability of healthcare services and socioeconomic factors. In 2007, 0.9 million eligible Indonesian children missed measles vaccination, and 19 456 cases of measles were documented among Indonesian children. The authors investigated rural-urban differentials in measles vaccination coverage among young Indonesian children, and sought to identify key factors influencing the probability of a child receiving the first dose of measles vaccination in Indonesia. METHODS: Data used in the analyses were sourced from the nationally representative Indonesia Demographic and Health Survey 2007. The influence of location of residence, household wealth, maternal and paternal education, total children ever born and use of skilled birth attendants on measles vaccination coverage was investigated using bivariate analysis and chi-square tests. The independent effects of these variables were established using binomial logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Indonesia's 2007 first-dose measles national vaccination coverage was, at 72.8%, lower than the 2008 global first-dose measles vaccination average coverage of 82%. Bivariate analysis revealed that the first-dose measles vaccination coverage in rural areas of Indonesia was 68.5%, compared with 80.1% in urban regions (p < 0.001). The apparent significance of rural residence in impairing vaccination coverage was marginal after controlling for the sex of the child, maternal age, maternal and paternal education, wealth, and access to skilled health workers. CONCLUSION: Apart from sustainable initiatives to increase measles vaccination coverage globally, it is important to close the rural-urban gap in Indonesia's measles vaccination uptake. Addressing critical determinants of inferior measles vaccination coverage in Indonesia's rural regions will facilitate major improvements in Indonesia's child health trends. This article suggests initiatives for addressing three of such determinants in Indonesia's rural areas: poverty, parental education and access to skilled health workers.","Fernandez RC, Awofeso N, Rammohan A",Rural Remote Health,2011,Measles AND Indonesia
26068565,"Progress Toward Measles Elimination - South-East Asia Region, 2003-2013.","In 2013, the 66th session of the Regional Committee of the World Health Organization (WHO) South-East Asia Region adopted the goal of measles elimination and rubella and congenital rubella syndrome control by 2020 after rigorous prior consultations. The recommended strategies include 1) achieving and maintaining >/=95% coverage with 2 doses of measles- and rubella-containing vaccine in every district through routine or supplementary immunization activities (SIAs); 2) developing and sustaining a sensitive and timely case-based measles surveillance system that meets recommended performance indicators; 3) developing and maintaining an accredited measles laboratory network; and 4) achieving timely identification, investigation, and response to measles outbreaks. This report updates previous reports and summarizes progress toward measles elimination in the South-East Asia Region during 2003-2013. Within the region, coverage with the first dose of a measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) increased from 67% to 78%; an estimated 286 million children (95% of the target population) were vaccinated in SIAs; measles incidence decreased 73%, from 59 to 16 cases per million population; and estimated measles deaths decreased 63%. To achieve measles elimination in the region, additional efforts are needed in countries with <95% 2-dose routine MCV coverage, particularly in India and Indonesia, to strengthen routine immunization services, conduct periodic high-quality SIAs, and strengthen measles case-based surveillance and laboratory diagnosis of measles.","Thapa A, Khanal S, Sharapov U, Swezy V, Sedai T, Dabbagh A, Rota P, Goodson JL, McFarland J",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,2015 Jun 12,Measles AND Indonesia
37362839,COVID-19 Immune Response In Adults Post Measles-Rubella Vaccination.,"Objective: This study aimed to see how measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination affected the increase in SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin levels in individuals who had received the second dose of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Material and Method: This research is a quasi-experimental type with a pre-post test design. The population studied were adults who had received the second dose of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, consisting of 30 people. Results: The results of this study were that most (60%) research subjects experienced an increase in IgM and some subjects (46.6%) experienced an increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels. The administration of the MR vaccination had no effect on increasing anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM levels. This happened because the increase in IgM and IgG levels in the pre and post-tests in most research subjects was relatively low. Conclusion: The administration of the MR vaccine to adults who had received a second dose of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine elicited a response with low levels of IgG and IgM SARS-CoV-2.","Suwoyo S, Yani ER, Hardjito K",Vacunas,2023 May 18,Measles AND Indonesia
8279811,"Antiviral traditional medicines against herpes simplex virus (HSV-1), poliovirus, and measles virus in vitro and their therapeutic efficacies for HSV-1 infection in mice.","One hundred forty-two kinds of traditional medicines, which have been historically used in China, Indonesia, and Japan, were examined for the antiviral activity of their hot water (HW) extracts against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), poliovirus type 1, and measles virus by plaque reduction assay. Thirty-two, 55, and 30 HW-extracts of them showed anti-HSV-1, antipoliovirus, and anti-measles virus activities, respectively. Among the 32 HW-extracts with anti-HSV-1 activity, 3 HW-extracts had anti-HSV-1 activity alone and the others showed anti-HSV-1 activity with anti-poliovirus and/or anti-measles virus activities. The 32 HW-extracts were further examined for their therapeutic efficacies of HSV-1 infection in mice. The mice were infected cutaneously with HSV-1 and HW-extracts were orally administered three times daily. Twelve HW-extracts, currently used for the treatment of various diseases other than viral infection, were found to be significantly effective in limiting the development of skin lesions and/or in prolonging the mean survival times of HSV-1-infected mice. These results suggested that 12 of 142 HW-extracts that exhibited therapeutic efficacy in an animal infection model were possible candidates for anti-HSV-1 traditional medicine.","Kurokawa M, Ochiai H, Nagasaka K, Neki M, Xu H, Kadota S, Sutardjo S, Matsumoto T, Namba T, Shiraki K",Antiviral Res,1993 Oct,Measles AND Indonesia
7605697,"Health practices and indices of a poor urban population in Indonesia. Part II: Immunization, nutrition, and incidence of diarrhea.","This second section in a two-part study of health indices and practices among a poor urban population in Indonesia focuses on problems related to immunization, nutrition, and incidence of diarrhea. Through a survey of 690 mothers and 593 children in two slum communities in Jakarta, we found that 1) 65% of the children were mildly to severely malnourished according to Gomez criteria, with malnutrition most prevalent among the poorest; 2) 75% of the mothers reported exclusive breastfeeding of their infants during the first four months after birth, but breastfeeding decreased sharply with increasing socioeconomic status; 3) of the 19% of one- to three-year-old children who were incompletely immunized, most were likely to be missing their measles and DPT3 immunizations; and 4) 28% of the mothers reported that at least one of their under-three-year-old children had diarrhea in the last month, with frequency of reporting highest among poor mothers and those using water from vendors. We concluded that selective interventions should be accompanied by development of a comprehensive health infrastructure that permits uninterrupted service delivery and follow up of those identified as high risk. Such a comprehensive primary health care system should be part of a multisectoral development strategy.","Kaye K, Novell M",Asia Pac J Public Health,1994,Measles AND Indonesia

29851943,"Progress Toward Rubella and Congenital Rubella Syndrome Control - South-East Asia Region, 2000-2016.","In 2013, the 66th session of the Regional Committee of the World Health Organization (WHO) South-East Asia Region (SEAR)* adopted the goal of elimination of measles and control(dagger) of rubella and congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) by 2020 (1). Rubella is the leading vaccine-preventable cause of birth defects. Although rubella typically causes a mild fever and rash in children and adults, rubella virus infection during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, can result in miscarriage, fetal death, or a constellation of congenital malformations known as CRS, commonly including visual, auditory, and/or cardiac defects, and developmental delay (2). Rubella and CRS control capitalizes on the momentum created by pursuing measles elimination because the efforts are programmatically linked. Rubella-containing vaccine (RCV) is administered as a combined measles and rubella vaccine, and rubella cases are detected through case-based surveillance for measles or fever and rash illness (3). This report summarizes progress toward rubella and CRS control in SEAR during 2000-2016. Estimated coverage with a first RCV dose (RCV1) increased from 3% of the birth cohort in 2000 to 15% in 2016 because of RCV introduction in six countries. RCV1 coverage is expected to increase rapidly with the phased introduction of RCV in India and Indonesia beginning in 2017; these countries are home to 83% of the SEAR birth cohort. During 2000-2016, approximately 83 million persons were vaccinated through 13 supplemental immunization activities (SIAs) conducted in eight countries. During 2010-2016, reported rubella incidence decreased by 37%, from 8.6 to 5.4 cases per 1 million population, and four countries (Bangladesh, Maldives, Sri Lanka, and Thailand) reported a decrease in incidence of >/=95% since 2010. To achieve rubella and CRS control in SEAR, sustained investment to increase routine RCV coverage, periodic high-quality SIAs to close immunity gaps, and strengthened rubella and CRS surveillance are needed.","Khanal S, Bahl S, Sharifuzzaman M, Dhongde D, Pattamadilok S, Reef S, Morales M, Dabbagh A, Kretsinger K, Patel M",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,2018 Jun 1,Measles AND Indonesia
16989262,Mass vaccination and surveillance/containment in the eradication of smallpox.,"The Smallpox Eradication Program, initiated by the WHO in 1966, was originally based on mass vaccination. The program emphasized surveillance from the beginning, largely to track the success of the program and further our understanding of the epidemiology of the disease. Early observations in West Africa, bolstered by later data from Indonesia and the Asian subcontinent, showed that smallpox did not spread rapidly, and outbreaks could be quickly controlled by isolation of patients and vaccination of their contacts. Contacts were usually easy to find because transmission of smallpox usually required prolonged face-to-face contact. The emphasis therefore shifted to active searches to find cases, coupled with contact tracing, rigorous isolation of patients, and vaccination and surveillance of contacts to contain outbreaks. This shift away from mass vaccination resulted in an acceleration of the program's success.",Lane JM,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,2006,Measles AND Indonesia

However, these issues of inequality in MCV1 coverage have not yet been systematically examined. We used data from the latest Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys. To provide a comprehensive picture of existing MCV1 coverage gaps, data were disaggregated by geographic location, as well as by socioeconomic and nutritional dimensions. National MCV1 coverage ranged from 77% in Myanmar to 92% in Thailand. Only nine of the 104 sub-national districts had achieved the 95% MCV1 coverage goal as set by the WHO. Geographic inequalities were more pronounced in countries with lower coverage levels. Areas in clusters with poor MCV1 coverage performances as well as disadvantaged socioeconomic profiles require increased attention. Inequalities were evident in all countries, except Thailand, and were more pronounced in the sectors of wealth, education, antenatal care (ANC) status, and vitamin A supplementation (VAS) when compared against the areas of gender and urban/rural residence. Wealth-related inequality in Bangladesh, education-related inequality in Indonesia, ANC-related inequalities in Myanmar and Nepal, and VAS-related inequalities in Indonesia and Myanmar were all noteworthy. Equity-oriented changes in policies focusing on health promotion and integrated interventions among disadvantaged populations need to be implemented in order to increase MCV1 coverage and reduce childhood mortality.","Gao Y, Kc A, Chen C, Huang Y, Wang Y, Zou S, Zhou H",Hum Vaccin Immunother,2020 Jul 2,Measles AND Indonesia
38924461,Economic evaluation of second measles containing vaccine (MCV) dose: a systematic review of available evidence.,"INTRODUCTION: The global measles incidence has decreased from 145 to 49 cases per 1 million population from 2000 to 2018, but evaluating the economic benefits of a second measles-containing vaccine (MCV2) is crucial. This study reviewed the evidence and quality of economic evaluation studies to guide MCV2 introduction. METHODS: The systematic review of model-based economic evaluation studies was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The search yielded 2231 articles, with 876 duplicates removed and 1355 articles screened, with nine studies included for final analysis. RESULTS: Six studies reported a positive benefit-cost ratio with one resulting in net savings of $11.6 billion, and two studies estimated a 2-dose MMR vaccination program would save $119.24 to prevent one measles case, and a second dose could prevent 9,200 cases at 18 months, saving $548.19 per case. The most sensitive variables were the discount rate and vaccination administration cost. CONCLUSIONS: Two MCV doses or a second opportunity with an additional dose of MCV were highly cost-beneficial and resulted in substantial cost savings compared to a single routine vaccine. But further research using high-quality model-based health economic evaluation studies of MCV2 should be made available to decision-makers.

17539257,Malnutrition and infectious disease morbidity among children missed by the childhood immunization program in Indonesia.,"Although it has been thought that child immunization programs may miss the children who are in greatest need, there are little published quantitative data to support this idea. We sought to characterize malnutrition and morbidity among children who are missed by the childhood immunization program in Indonesia. Vaccination and morbidity histories, anthropometry, and other data were collected for 286,500 children, aged 12-59 months, in rural Indonesia. Seventy-three point nine percent of children received complete immunizations (3 doses of diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus, 3 doses of oral poliovirus, and measles), 16.8% had partial coverage (1-6 of 7 vaccine doses), and 9.3% received no vaccines. Of children with complete, partial, and no immunization coverage, respectively, the prevalence of severe underweight (weight-for-age Z score < -3) was 5.4, 9.9, and 12.6%, severe stunting (height-for-age Z score < -3) was 10.2, 16.2, and 21.5%, and current diarrhea was 3.8, 7.3, and 8.6% (all p < 0.0001), respectively. In families where the child had complete, partial, and no immunizations, the history of infant mortality was 6.4, 11.4, and 16.5%, and under-five child mortality was 7.3, 13.4, and 19.2% (both p < 0.0001).

18545744,Epidemiology and etiology of childhood pneumonia.,"Childhood pneumonia is the leading single cause of mortality in children aged less than 5 years. The incidence in this age group is estimated to be 0.29 episodes per child-year in developing and 0.05 episodes per child-year in developed countries. This translates into about 156 million new episodes each year worldwide, of which 151 million episodes are in the developing world. Most cases occur in India (43 million), China (21 million) and Pakistan (10 million), with additional high numbers in Bangladesh, Indonesia and Nigeria (6 million each). Of all community cases, 7-13% are severe enough to be life-threatening and require hospitalization. Substantial evidence revealed that the leading risk factors contributing to pneumonia incidence are lack of exclusive breastfeeding, undernutrition, indoor air pollution, low birth weight, crowding and lack of measles immunization. Pneumonia is responsible for about 19% of all deaths in children aged less than 5 years, of which more than 70% take place in sub-Saharan Africa and south-east Asia. Although based on limited available evidence, recent studies have identified Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and respiratory syncytial virus as the main pathogens associated with childhood pneumonia.","Rudan I, Boschi-Pinto C, Biloglav Z, Mulholland K, Campbell H",Bull World Health Organ,2008 May,Measles AND Indonesia
35422336,Timeliness of routine childhood vaccinations in Indonesian infants in the first year of life.,"BACKGROUND: Vaccines have proven to be one of the most effective strategies to control infectious diseases and contributed to childhood survival. While high vaccine coverages provide individual's and herd immunity, age-appropriate vaccination or vaccine timeliness is important for maximum vaccine's protection, but often not evaluated. We aimed to describe the timeliness of childhood vaccination for Indonesian infants and identify risk factors associated with delayed vaccination. METHODS: This study was a sub-study of the Indonesian Pneumonia and Vitamin D status (IPAD) study, a community-based cohort study to investigate pneumonia incidence in two districts in Yogyakarta province, Indonesia. Socio-demographic data were obtained from structured interviews and vaccine status was obtained from maternal and child health records. Timely vaccination was defined if the vaccine was received between four days or less before and within 28 days after the recommended age of vaccination. RESULTS: 359 (85%) out of 422 IPAD participants and their immunisation records were included. Between December 2015 and December 2017, vaccination coverage was high and ranged from 96.1% (Measles) to 100% (DTP-HepB-Hib 1). However, two thirds (67%, 242/359) of all participants had received either early or late vaccines, with dose 2 IPV (40%, 143/356), dose 3 IPV (56%, 196/349) and dose 3 DTP-HepB-Hib (29%, 103/354) most delayed, and only 1% received early doses. The main risk factors for untimely vaccination were if the infant was born in a private practice versus in a public health facility (AOR 1.90; 95% CI: 1.18-3.07) and rural residence (AOR 1.84; 95% CI: 1.15-2.94). CONCLUSIONS: Despite high vaccine coverage for Indonesian infants (>95%), two thirds (67%) of infants had untimely vaccinations, with dose 3 IPV (56%) the most delayed. Future strategies should focus on coordination between government, health care providers, and carers to ensure timely access and vaccination of infants to ensure adherence to vaccination schedules.","Oktaria V, Bines JE, Murni IK, Dinari R, Indraswari BW, Alvianita A, Putri DA, Danchin M",Vaccine,2022 May 9,Measles AND Indonesia

The plaque-reduction microneutralization assay was conducted to measure the titer of measles specific IgG antibody. The level of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells that exhibiting gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) secretion were analyzed by flow cytometry. The association between variable was analyzed by linear regression. The difference immune response among variable were analyzed with Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: Vitamin A supplementation and breastfeeding were predicted as associated factor for humoral and cellular immune response after one month and six months measles vaccination among Indonesia Infants.

23114256,"Global routine vaccination coverage, 2011.","In 1974, the World Health Organization (WHO) established the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) to ensure all children had access to routinely recommended vaccines. Initially, those vaccines were limited to bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine (BCG), diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine (DTP), oral poliovirus vaccine, and measles-containing vaccine (MCV). Global coverage with the third dose of DTP (DTP3) increased from <5% in 1974 to 79% by 2005. However, one fifth of the world's children, especially those in low-income countries, still were not fully vaccinated during the first year of life with the four traditional EPI vaccines. In 2005, WHO and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) developed the Global Immunization Vision and Strategy (GIVS) to improve national immunization programs and decrease vaccine-preventable disease-associated morbidity and mortality. A goal was to reach a sustained national DTP3 coverage of 90% in all countries. This report summarizes global routine vaccination coverage during 2011.

33819837,Persistent Socioeconomic Inequalities in Measles Vaccine Uptake in Ethiopia in the Period 2005 to 2016.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to quantify socioeconomic inequalities-and the factors contributing to these inequalities-in measles vaccine uptake among children aged 12 to 23 months in Ethiopia between 2005 and 2016. METHODS: Inequalities in measles vaccine uptake were investigated based on data from the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 2005, 2011, and 2016. Concentration curves and concentration indices were used to measure the degree of inequality, and decomposition analysis was used to identify factors contributing to these inequalities. RESULTS: The overall level of national measles vaccine uptake in Ethiopia exhibited an increasing trend between 2005 and 2016. As indicated by the concentration index of measles vaccine uptake, however, which was estimated at 0.202 (P < .01) in 2005, 0.226 (P < .01) in 2011, and 0.223 (P < .01) in 2016, measles vaccine uptake became consistently more concentrated among children from more affluent households. The dominance test of the concentration curve further confirmed the persistence of inequalities in measles vaccine uptake over time. Various factors-including maternal educational level, antenatal care use, institutional delivery, and exposure to media-were identified as the most important contributors to the inequalities. CONCLUSIONS: Although the national measles vaccine uptake showed improvement between 2005 and 2016, socioeconomic inequalities in the uptake persisted over time. Efforts to improve the national immunization coverage should be accompanied by appropriate measures to address the inequalities.","Wondimu A, van Hulst M, Postma MJ",Value Health Reg Issues,2021 Sep,Measles AND Indonesia
1845658,The effectiveness of immunization.,"This article reviews the expanded programme on immunization in Indonesia, Pengembangan Program Imunisasi (PPI) which was launched in 1977. We are apt to know what the current situation is after ten years have passed. WHO proposes that EPI/PPI be systemically evaluated with respect to their effectiveness which is reflected by a reduction achieved in the incidence of the target diseases. Priority is being accorded to measuring disease trends for three diseases i.e. poliomyelitis, measles and neonatal tetanus. A considerable effect on target diseases had been observed and it was evident that PPI can reduce the incidence of target diseases. A goal had been set to eliminate indigenous paralytic poliomyelitis by the end of the fifth ""Five Year Plan"". Another goal had also been adopted, i.e. neonatal tetanus elimination by 1985 in Java and Bali. The effectiveness of immunization is ascertained and we have the optimism that poliomyelitis and neonatal tetanus elimination goals can be achieved.",Kaspan MF,Paediatr Indones,1991 Nov-Dec,Measles AND Indonesia
31906914,An evaluation of the clinical features of measles virus infection for diagnosis in children within a limited resources setting.,"BACKGROUND: Measles is a recurrent health problem in both advanced and developed countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends anti-measles immunoglobulin M (Ig M) as the standard method of detecting the virus; however, many areas still present the inability to perform a serology test of anti-measles IgM. Therefore, a typical clinical feature is necessary to establish the diagnosis of measles. The objective of this study was to evaluate hyperpigmented rash and other clinical features as the diagnostic tools with respect to measles, especially in an outbreak setting. METHODS: In this observational diagnostic study, the inclusion criteria were as follows: between 6 and 144 months of age, fever, maculopapular rash for 3 days or more, accompanied by a cough, or coryza, or conjunctivitis. Those with a prior history of measles vaccination (1-6 weeks) were excluded, in addition to those with histories of corticosteroid for 2 weeks or more and immunocompromised conditions. The samples were taken from Dr. Soetomo General Academic Hospital in Surabaya, Indonesia. We evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, the positive predictive value, and the negative predictive value of such clinical features. Hyperpigmented rash was validated using Kappa and Mc Nemar tests. Anti-measles Ig M was considered as the gold standard. RESULTS: This study gathered 82 participants. The clinical manifestations of all subjects included fever, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, Koplik spots, and maculopapular rash (which turns into hyperpigmented rash along the course of the illness). Most maculopapular rashes turn out to be hyperpigmented (89%). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive values ​​of the combination of fever, maculopapular rash, and hyperpigmented rash were found to be at 90.7, 28.6, 93.2, and 22.2%, respectively. The Mc Nemar and Kappa tests showed p values of 0.774 and 0.119, respectively. CONCLUSION: The combination of fever, maculopapular rash, and hyperpigmented rash can be used as a screening tool regarding measles infection in an outbreak setting, which can then be confirmed by anti-measles Ig M. Cough, coryza, and Koplik's spot can be added to this combination, albeit with a slight reduction of sensitivity value.","Husada D, Kusdwijono, Puspitasari D, Kartina L, Basuki PS, Ismoedijanto",BMC Pediatr,2020 Jan 6,Measles AND Indonesia
7311109,"Serological survey for SV5, measles and herpes simplex infections in newly-imported cynomolgus monkeys.","On 592 cynomolgus monkeys of newly-imported 14 different groups, sero-epidemiological follow-up surveys of natural infections with SV5, measles (MV) and herpes simplex (HSV) were conducted both at the time of arrival and at the end of the 9-week quarantine period at Tsukuba Primate Center for Medical Science (TPC). At the time of arrival, the positive rate of antibodies against these viruses greatly varied with different countries of origin. As regards SV5, the positive rate ranged widely from 0 to 94.9% among different import-groups, being markedly low in the Philippine monkey groups. The positive rate of MV antibody was generally very high, varying from 11.1 to 78.2% in almost all import-groups except two groups from Indonesia in which no positive case was detected. Concerning HSV, every import-group had a very high positive rate though the average antibody titer was not so high. Generally, the positive rates of SV5 and MV markedly increased by the end of quarantine period. Especially, MV positive rate reached 100% in almost all of the import-groups. However, two Indonesian groups showed no increase of SV5 and MV positive rates during the quarantine period. No increase of SV5 positive rate was detected either with any of three Philippine groups. As for HSV, the positive rate remained unchanged or rather decreased during the quarantine period in almost all groups except two Indonesian groups having shown a significant increase.","Suzuki M, Sasagawa A, Inayoshi T, Nakamura F, Honjo S",Jpn J Med Sci Biol,1981 Apr,Measles AND Indonesia
26619458,"Measles Outbreak Associated With International Travel, Indiana, 2011.","BACKGROUND: Endemic measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, but imported measles cases continue to cause outbreaks. On June 20, 2011, 5 epidemiologically linked measles cases were reported to the Indiana State Department of Health. We investigated to identify additional cases and to prevent further spread. METHODS: Case findings and contact investigations during the June 3, 2011-August 13, 2011 outbreak identified measles cases, exposed persons, and exposure settings. Laboratory confirmation included measles serology and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Control measures included evaluating measles immune status and providing post-exposure prophylaxis, isolation, and quarantine. RESULTS: Fourteen confirmed measles illnesses were identified (10 [71%] females; median age, 11.5 years [range, 15 months-27 years]). The source patient was an unvaccinated US resident who recently traveled from Indonesia. Twelve patients were unvaccinated members of the source patient's extended family. Two hospitalizations and no deaths were reported. Among 868 exposed persons identified through contact investigation, 644 (74%) had documented measles immunity, 153 (18%) were lost to follow-up, and 71 (8%) lacked evidence of immunity. CONCLUSIONS: Misdiagnosis of measles in an unvaccinated patient with recent travel history to a measles-endemic region resulted in the second largest measles outbreak in the United States during 2011. Clinicians should consider measles among patients presenting with febrile rash illness and history of recent travel, and clinicians should promptly report suspected illnesses. Early identification of infectious patients, rapid public health investigation, and maintenance of high vaccine coverage are critical for the prevention and control of measles outbreaks.","Collier MG, Cierzniewski A, Duszynski T, Munson C, Wenger M, Beard B, Gentry R, Duwve J, Kutty PK, Pontones P",J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc,2013 Jun,Measles AND Indonesia
12721886,The global burden of measles in the year 2000--a model that uses country-specific indicators.,"The estimation of the global burden of measles is challenging in the absence of reliable and comparable surveillance systems worldwide. A static model is described that enables estimation of measles morbidity, mortality, and disability for the year 2000 on the basis of country-specific information (i.e., demographic profile, vaccine coverage, and estimates of case-fatality ratios). This approach estimated a global incidence of 39.9 million measles cases, 777,000 deaths, and 28 million disability-adjusted life years. The World Health Organization regions of Africa and Southeast Asia had 70% of incident cases and 84% of measles-related deaths; 11 countries alone (Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia, Uganda) account for 66% of deaths. This approach quantifies the measles burden by considering country-specific indicators, which can be updated, permitting an assessment of country, regional, and global changes in the burden associated with measles infection.","Stein CE, Birmingham M, Kurian M, Duclos P, Strebel P",J Infect Dis,2003 May 15,Measles AND Indonesia

36495882,"Evaluation of the safety, immunogenicity, and faecal shedding of novel oral polio vaccine type 2 in healthy newborn infants in Bangladesh: a randomised, controlled, phase 2 clinical trial.","BACKGROUND: Type 2 circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV2) from Sabin oral poliovirus vaccines (OPVs) are the leading cause of poliomyelitis. A novel type 2 OPV (nOPV2) has been developed to be more genetically stable with similar tolerability and immunogenicity to that of Sabin type 2 vaccines to mitigate the risk of cVDPV2. We aimed to assess these aspects of nOPV2 in poliovirus vaccine-naive newborn infants. METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, controlled, phase 2 trial we enrolled newborn infants at the Matlab Health Research Centre, Chandpur, Bangladesh. We included infants who were healthy and were a single birth after at least 37 weeks' gestation. Infants were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either two doses of nOPV2 or placebo, administered at age 0-3 days and at 4 weeks. Exclusion criteria included receipt of rotavirus or any other poliovirus vaccine, any infection or illness at the time of enrolment (vomiting, diarrhoea, or intolerance to liquids), diagnosis or suspicion of any immunodeficiency disorder in the infant or a close family member, or any contraindication for venipuncture. The primary safety outcome was safety and tolerability after one and two doses of nOPV2, given 4 weeks apart in poliovirus vaccine-naive newborn infants and the primary immunogenicity outcome was the seroconversion rate for neutralising antibodies against type 2 poliovirus, measured 28 days after the first and second vaccinations with nOPV2. Study staff recorded solicited and unsolicited adverse events after each dose during daily home visits for 7 days. Poliovirus neutralising antibody responses were measured in sera drawn at birth and at age 4 weeks and 8 weeks. This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04693286. FINDINGS: Between Sept 21, 2020, and Aug 16, 2021, we screened 334 newborn infants, of whom three (<1%) were found to be ineligible and one (<1%) was withdrawn by the parents; the remaining 330 (99%) infants were assigned to receive nOPV2 (n=220 [67%]) or placebo (n=110 [33%]). nOPV2 was well tolerated; 154 (70%) of 220 newborn infants in the nOPV2 group and 78 (71%) of 110 in the placebo group had solicited adverse events, which were all mild or moderate in severity. Severe unsolicited adverse events in 11 (5%) vaccine recipients and five (5%) placebo recipients were considered unrelated to vaccination. 306 (93%) of 330 infants had seroprotective maternal antibodies against type 2 poliovirus at birth, decreasing to 58 (56%) of 104 in the placebo group at 8 weeks. In the nOPV2 group 196 (90%) of 217 infants seroconverted by week 8 after two doses, when 214 (99%) had seroprotective antibodies. INTERPRETATION: nOPV2 was well tolerated and immunogenic in newborn infants, with two doses, at birth and 4 weeks, resulting in almost 99% of infants having protective neutralising antibodies.

24331015,"The inception, achievements, and implications of the China GAVI Alliance Project on Hepatitis B Immunization.","The China GAVI Hepatitis B Immunization Project was initiated in 2002 with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between GAVI and the Government of China. The Project was one of the three (China, India, and Indonesia) GAVI-initiated special projects done to support countries too large to receive full GAVI support for hepatitis B vaccine and safe injections. The Project in China was designed by the Chinese Government and partners to deliver free hepatitis B vaccine and safe injections to all newborns in the 12 Western Provinces and Poverty Counties in 10 Provinces of Central China (1301 Counties with approximately 5.6 million births per year), eliminating the gap in immunization coverage between wealthier and poorer regions of China. The project budget (USD 76 million) was equally shared by GAVI and the Chinese Government. Initially planned for 5 years, two no cost extensions extended the project to 2011. Although China produced hepatitis B vaccine, before the project the vaccine was sold to parents who were also charged a ""user fee"" for the syringe and vaccine administration. Basic Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) vaccines such as BCG, DTP, Polio, and measles vaccines were provided free to parents, although they were charged a user fee. Vaccines were sold by China CDC Offices at provincial, prefecture, county level and township hospitals, and village doctors received a substantial portion of their income from the sale of hepatitis B and other vaccines. The result of charging for hepatitis B vaccine was that coverage was relatively high in Eastern and wealthier counties in Central China (~80-90%), but was much lower (~40%) in Western China and Poverty Counties where parents could not afford the vaccine. The Project was administered by the China MOH and China CDC EPI program, and two Project Co-managers, one from the Chinese Government and the other an international assignee, were chosen. The project had an oversight Operational Advisory Group composed of the Chinese Government, WHO, UNICEF, and GAVI. The initial targets of the project as delineated in the initial MOU for the Project areas (HepB3 coverage will reach 85% at the county level, >75% of newborns at the county level will receive the first dose of hepatitis B within 24h of birth, and all immunization injections will be with auto disable [AD] syringes) were substantially exceeded. The differential in vaccine coverage between wealthier and poorer parts of China was eliminated contributing to a great improvement in equity. With additional contributions of the Chinese Government the Project was accomplished substantially under budget allowing for additional catch up immunization of children under 15 years of age. More than 5 million health workers were trained in how to deliver hepatitis B vaccine, timely birth dose (TBD), and safe injections, and public awareness of hepatitis B and its prevention rose significantly. TBD coverage was expedited by concurrent efforts to have women deliver in township clinics and district hospitals instead of at home. The effective management of the Project, with a Project office sitting within the China EPI and an Operational Advisory Group for oversight, could serve as a model for other GAVI projects worldwide. Most importantly, the carrier rate in Chinese children less than 5 years of age has fallen to 1%, from a level of 10% before the inception of the Project. Liver cancer, one of the major cancer killers in China (250,000-300,000 annual estimated deaths), will dramatically decline as immunized cohorts of Chinese children age. While hepatitis C and non-alcoholic liver disease also exist in China and can lead to liver cancer and cirrhosis, the majority of liver disease in China is hepatitis B related and therefore preventable. The authors believe that China's success in preventing hepatitis B is one of the greatest public health achievements of the 21st century. Work remains to be done in several key areas. There are still pockets of home births in rural provinces where a TBD is difficult to deliver, and China is strengthening its policy of screening pregnant women for HBsAg and delivering HBIG plus vaccine to newborns of HBV carrier mothers. Approximately 10% of the adult population of China remain chronic carriers of hepatitis B virus and cannot be helped by the vaccine, so prevention of liver cancer and cirrhosis in those groups remains a future challenge for China.","Kane MA, Hadler SC, Lee L, Shapiro CN, Cui F, Wang X, Kumar R",Vaccine,2013 Dec 27,Measles AND Indonesia

35078426,Prevalence of measles antibodies among migrant workers in Singapore: a serological study to identify susceptible population subgroups.,"BACKGROUND: In 2019, two clusters of measles cases were reported in migrant worker dormitories in Singapore. We conducted a seroprevalence study to measure the level of susceptibility to measles among migrant workers in Singapore. METHODS: Our study involved residual sera of migrant workers from seven Asian countries (Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar and the Philippines) who had participated in a survey between 2016 and 2019. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels were first measured using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test kit. Those with equivocal or negative IgG results were further evaluated using plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). RESULTS: A total of 2234 migrant workers aged 20-49 years were included in the study. The overall prevalence of measles IgG antibodies among migrant workers from the seven Asian countries was 90.5% (95% confidence interval 89.2-91.6%). The country-specific seroprevalence ranged from 80.3 to 94.0%. The seroprevalence was significantly higher among migrant workers born in 1965-1989 than those born in 1990-1999 (95.3% vs. 86.6%, p < 0.0005), whereas there was no significant difference by gender (90.8% in men vs. 89.9% in women, p = 0.508). 195 out of 213 samples with equivocal or negative ELISA results were tested positive using PRNT. CONCLUSION: The IgG seroprevalence in migrant workers was below the herd immunity threshold of 95% for measles. Sporadic outbreaks may occur in susceptible individuals due to high transmissibility of measles virus. Seroprevalence surveys can help identify susceptible subgroups for vaccination.","Ang LW, Gao Q, Cui L, Farwin A, Toh MPHS, Boudville IC, Chen MI, Chow A, Lin RT, Lee VJM, Leo YS",BMC Infect Dis,2022 Jan 25,Measles AND Indonesia
21393113,Improved growth of toddlers fed a milk containing synbiotics.,"Bifidobacterium longum (BL999), Lactobacillus rhamonosus (LPR), prebiotics (inulin and fructo-oligosaccharides), and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) are believed to have health benefits. In a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial we compared growth and development of toddlers fed milk containing synbiotics (BL999, LPR, and prebiotics) and LCPUFA or a control milk. Three hundred and ninety three healthy, 12 month-old toddlers were fed approximately 400 mL/day for 12 months. Anthropometric measurements were taken at 12, 14, and 16 months. Toddlers' response to measles and hepatitis A vaccine was measured at 16 months, and Bayley scale for motor, cognitive, and behavioral functions made at 24 months. The primary outcome was weight gain between 12 and 16 months. Secondary outcomes were gain in length, head circumference, and body mass index, gastrointestinal tolerance (stool characteristics), stool bacterial counts, safety, anti-vaccine IgG, and neurodevelopment. Weight gain was greater in the synbiotics group (mean+/-SD, 7.57+/-4.13 g/day) compared with the control group (6.64+/-4.08 g/day). The difference of 0.93 g/day (with a 95% confidence interval of 0.12 to 1.75) is significant (p=0.025). The gain in the synbiotics group resulted in a change in z-score weight-for-age closer to WHO Child Growth Standard. There was a significant increase in lactobacilli and enterococci counts between 12 months and 16 months in the synbiotic group. We conclude that in healthy toddlers milk containing synbiotics and LCPUFA provides better growth and promotes favorable gut colonization, as shown by higher Lactobacillus counts.","Firmansyah A, Dwipoerwantoro PG, Kadim M, Alatas S, Conus N, Lestarina L, Bouisset F, Steenhout P",Asia Pac J Clin Nutr,2011,Measles AND Indonesia
36366426,"Immunoinformatics Identification of the Conserved and Cross-Reactive T-Cell Epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 with Human Common Cold Coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and Live Attenuated Vaccines Presented by HLA Alleles of Indonesian Population.","Reports on T-cell cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 epitopes in unexposed individuals have been linked with prior exposure to the human common cold coronaviruses (HCCCs). Several studies suggested that cross-reactive T-cells response to live attenuated vaccines (LAVs) such as BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin), OPV (Oral Polio Vaccine), and MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) can limit the development and severity of COVID-19. This study aims to identify potential cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2, HCCCs, and LAVs in the context of T-cell epitopes peptides presented by HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) alleles of the Indonesian population. SARS-CoV-2 derived T-cell epitopes were predicted using immunoinformatics tools and assessed for their conservancy, variability, and population coverage. Two fully conserved epitopes with 100% similarity and nine heterologous epitopes with identical T-cell receptor (TCR) contact residues were identified from the ORF1ab fragment of SARS-CoV-2 and all HCCCs. Cross-reactive epitopes from various proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and LAVs were also identified (15 epitopes from BCG, 7 epitopes from MMR, but none from OPV). A majority of the identified epitopes were observed to belong to ORF1ab, further suggesting the vital role of ORF1ab in the coronaviruses family and suggesting it as a candidate for a potential universal coronavirus vaccine that protects against severe disease by inducing cell mediated immunity.","Gustiananda M, Julietta V, Hermawan A, Febriana GG, Hermantara R, Kristiani L, Sidhartha E, Sutejo R, Agustriawan D, Andarini S, Parikesit AA",Viruses,2022 Oct 24,Measles AND Indonesia

The effects of giving vitamin A, a potent immune enhancer, with measles immunization to nine-month-old infants is unknown. METHODS: A randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled clinical trial of vitamin A, 100,000 IU at the time of standard titer Schwarz measles immunization was conducted with nine-month-old infants in Bogor District, West Java, Indonesia. Antibody titers to measles were measured at baseline and one and six months following immunization. RESULTS: 394 infants received measles immunization, and 37 infants (9.4%) had baseline antibody titers > 1:120, which is consistent with previous natural measles infection. Of the remaining infants, 98.8% seroconverted to measles, and 99.3% had titers consistent with protection against measles six months postimmunization. Seroconversion rates were similar in vitamin A and placebo treatment groups. CONCLUSION: High dose vitamin A supplementation can be given without reducing seroconversion to standard titer Schwatz measles immunization in nine-month-old infants.","Semba RD, Akib A, Beeler J, Munasir Z, Permaesih D, Muherdiyantiningsih, Komala, Martuti S, Muhilal",Public Health,1997 Jul,Measles AND Indonesia
27670077,"Informing rubella vaccination strategies in East Java, Indonesia through transmission modelling.","An estimated 110,000 babies are born with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) worldwide annually; a significant proportion of cases occur in Southeast Asia. Rubella vaccine programs have led to successful control of rubella and CRS, and even the elimination of disease in many countries. However, if vaccination is poorly implemented it might increase the number of women reaching childbearing age who remain susceptible to rubella and thereby paradoxically increase CRS. We used an age-structured transmission model to compare seven alternative vaccine strategies for their impact on reducing CRS disease burden in East Java, a setting which is yet to implement a rubella vaccine program. We also investigated the robustness of model predictions to variation in vaccine coverage and other key epidemiological factors. Without rubella vaccination, approximately 700 babies are estimated to be born with CRS in East Java every year at an incidence of 0.77 per 1000live births. This incidence could be reduced to 0.0045 per 1000 live births associated with 99.9% annual reduction in rubella infections after 20 years if the existing two doses of measles vaccine are substituted with two doses of measles plus rubella combination vaccine with the same coverage (87.8% of 9-month-old infants and 80% of 6-year-old children). By comparison a single dose of rubella vaccine will take longer to reduce the burden of rubella and CRS and will be less robust to lower vaccine coverage. While the findings of this study should be informative for settings similar to East Java, the conclusions are dependent on vaccine coverage which would need consideration before applying to all of Indonesia and elsewhere in Asia.","Wu Y, Wood J, Khandaker G, Waddington C, Snelling T",Vaccine,2016 Nov 4,Measles AND Indonesia
23118271,Forecasting high-priority infectious disease surveillance regions: a socioeconomic model.,"BACKGROUND: Few researchers have assessed the relationships between socioeconomic inequality and infectious disease outbreaks at the population level globally. We use a socioeconomic model to forecast national annual rates of infectious disease outbreaks. METHODS: We constructed a multivariate mixed-effects Poisson model of the number of times a given country was the origin of an outbreak in a given year. The dataset included 389 outbreaks of international concern reported in the World Health Organization's Disease Outbreak News from 1996 to 2008. The initial full model included 9 socioeconomic variables related to education, poverty, population health, urbanization, health infrastructure, gender equality, communication, transportation, and democracy, and 1 composite index. Population, latitude, and elevation were included as potential confounders. The initial model was pared down to a final model by a backwards elimination procedure. The dependent and independent variables were lagged by 2 years to allow for forecasting future rates. RESULTS: Among the socioeconomic variables tested, the final model included child measles immunization rate and telephone line density. The Democratic Republic of Congo, China, and Brazil were predicted to be at the highest risk for outbreaks in 2010, and Colombia and Indonesia were predicted to have the highest percentage of increase in their risk compared to their average over 1996-2008. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding socioeconomic factors could help improve the understanding of outbreak risk. The inclusion of the measles immunization variable suggests that there is a fundamental basis in ensuring adequate public health capacity. Increased vigilance and expanding public health capacity should be prioritized in the projected high-risk regions.","Chan EH, Scales DA, Brewer TF, Madoff LC, Pollack MP, Hoen AG, Choden T, Brownstein JS",Clin Infect Dis,2013 Feb,Measles AND Indonesia

In a multiple logistic regression model adjusting for maternal antibody titres, vitamin A supplementation was associated with a lower likelihood of seroconversion to measles (odds ratio 0.40, 95% CI 0.19-0.88), and girls were less likely to seroconvert than boys (0.34, 0.15-0.76). Immunisation with standard-titre Schwarz vaccine at six months of age in this study population is characterised by high seroconversion rates. However, simultaneous high-dose vitamin A may interfere with seroconversion to live measles vaccine in infants with maternal antibody.","Semba RD, Munasir Z, Beeler J, Akib A, Muhilal, Audet S, Sommer A",Lancet,1995 May 27,Measles AND Indonesia

32962954,Urban-rural differences in factors associated with incomplete basic immunization among children in Indonesia: A nationwide multilevel study.,"BACKGROUND: Identifying risk factors of incomplete immunization among children is crucial to developing relevant policies to improve immunization coverage. In this study, we investigated factors associated with incomplete immunization among children in Indonesia and elucidated differences in risk factors between urban and rural areas. METHODS: The data came from a national-wide survey, the 2017 Indonesia Demographic Health Surveys. In total, 3264 children aged 12-23 months were included in the study. An incomplete immunization status was defined as a child who did not complete the ten doses of basic vaccinations, consisting of one dose of bacille Calmette-Guerin, one dose of hepatitis B, three doses of pentavalent vaccine (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hemophilus influenza type B, and hepatitis B vaccine), four doses of polio vaccine, and one dose of measles vaccine. Generalized linear mixed models were constructed to examine the effects of different levels of risk factors on the incomplete immunization status. We further conducted stratified analyses by urban and rural areas. RESULTS: About 40% of the 3264 children were incompletely immunized, among whom 45.3% were in urban areas and 54.7% were in rural areas. Eight of the 34 provinces had incomplete immunization rates exceeding 50%, and the Papua and Maluku regions had the highest rates of incomplete child immunization. The multivariate analyses showed that when women attended fewer than four antenatal care sessions and resided outside the Nusa Tenggara region, their children were more likely to have incomplete immunization in both urban and rural areas. On the other hand, having no health insurance was positively associated with incomplete immunization in urban areas, whereas having received a tetanus vaccination during pregnancy was negatively associated with incomplete immunization in rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study suggest that tailored interventions should be developed to address significant risk factors in rural and urban areas.","Hardhantyo M, Chuang YC",Pediatr Neonatol,2021 Jan,Measles AND Indonesia
38532918,Analysis of risk factor for pneumonia in children less than five years in Makassar.,"BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is one of the main causes of mortality in children less than five years worldwide and in Makassar City. The aim of this study was to investigate the risk factors for pneumonia in children less than five years in Makassar City. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case-control study design was used in this research. A total of 210 children with consent from the parents were included in this study, which consisted of 70 children's cases, and the data of the control group were taken by the random sampling method. All related data such as immunization record, nutritional status, birth body weight, vitamin A intake in the last six-month record, and parents' education, occupation, and monthly income were registered as independent and control variables. Data analysis was performed by the Chi-square and logistic regression model with a P value of 0.005 and odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Incomplete diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus-hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type B (DPT-HB-Hib) immunization at the age of 2 months, 3 months, and 4 months, which had adjusted OR (AOR = 9,680; P = 0,001) and malnutrition condition (weight for age) (AOR = 5,486; P < 0,005), were associated with the incidence of pneumonia in children less than five years, whereas incomplete measles-rubella (P = 0,770), low birth weight history (P = 0,403), lack of vitamin A intake (P = 0,720), parents' education (P = 0,163), and presence of smoker inside the household (P =) were not associated with the incidence of pneumonia in children less than five years (P > 0.005) in Makassar City. CONCLUSIONS: Incomplete DPT-HB-Hib immunization for three doses at the age of 2 months, 3 months, and 4 months and malnutrition were associated with pneumonia and the highest risk factors for developing pneumonia in children less than five years in Makassar City, Indonesia.","Sidabutar E, Ansariadi, Wahiduddin, Bustan N, Stang, Birawida AB",J Educ Health Promot,2024,Measles AND Indonesia
11697418,Integration of vitamin A supplementation with the Expanded Programme on Immunization: lack of impact on morbidity or infant growth.,"Vitamin A deficiency is associated with increased morbidity and mortality from diarrheal disease, measles, and malaria. It has been proposed that vitamin A supplementation could be linked with childhood immunization programs to improve child health. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the impact of linking vitamin A supplementation with the Expanded Programme on Immunization on morbidity and child growth. In West Java, Indonesia, 467 six-week-old infants were randomized to receive 7.5 mg retinol equivalent (RE), 15 mg RE, or placebo with childhood immunization contacts at 6, 10, and 14 wks and 9 mo of age. Child growth was assessed through anthropometry, and morbidity histories were obtained. Vitamin A supplementation had no apparent impact upon linear or ponderal growth or infectious disease morbidity in the first 15 mo of age when integrated with the Expanded Programme on Immunization. CONCLUSION: Although improving vitamin A nutriture is of general importance in reducing diarrheal and measles morbidity and mortality in developing countries, this clinical trial showed no apparent benefit of vitamin A capsules for infant health when given through childhood immunization programs.","Semba RD, Munasir Z, Akib A, Melikian G, Permaesih D, Muherdiyantiningsih, Marituti S, Muhilal",Acta Paediatr,2001 Oct,Measles AND Indonesia
40146988,Using an Electronic Immunization Registry (Aplikasi Sehat IndonesiaKu) in Indonesia: Cross-Sectional Study.,"BACKGROUND: Electronic immunization registries (EIRs) are being increasingly used in low- and middle-income countries. In 2022, Indonesia's Ministry of Health introduced its first EIR, named Aplikasi Sehat IndonesiaKu (ASIK), as part of a comprehensive nationwide immunization program. This marked a conversion from traditional paper-based immunization reports to digital routine records encompassing a network of 10,000 primary health centers (puskesmas). OBJECTIVE: This paper provides an overview of the use of ASIK as the first EIR in Indonesia. It describes the coverage of the nationwide immunization program (Bulan Imunisasi Anak Nasional) using ASIK data and assesses the implementation challenges associated with the adoption of the EIR in the context of Indonesia. METHODS: Data were collected from primary care health workers' submitted reports using ASIK. The data were reported in real time, analyzed, and presented using a structured dashboard. Data on ASIK use were collected from the ASIK website. A quantitative assessment was conducted through a cross-sectional survey between September 2022 and October 2022. A set of questionnaires was used to collect feedback from ASIK users. RESULTS: A total of 93.5% (9708/10,382) of public health centers, 93.5% (6478/6928) of subdistricts, and 97.5% (501/514) of districts and cities in 34 provinces reported immunization data using ASIK. With >21 million data points recorded, the national coverage for immunization campaigns for measles-rubella; oral polio vaccine; inactivated polio vaccine; and diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine were 50.1% (18,301,057/36,497,694), 36.2% (938,623/2,595,240), 30.7% (1,276,668/4,158,289), and 40.2% (1,371,104/3,407,900), respectively. The quantitative survey showed that, generally, users had a good understanding of ASIK as the EIR (650/809, 80.3%), 61.7% (489/793) of the users expressed that the user interface and user experience were overall good but could still be improved, 54% (422/781) of users expressed that the ASIK variable fit their needs yet could be improved further, and 59.1% (463/784) of users observed sporadic system interference. Challenges faced during the implementation of ASIK included a heavy workload burden for health workers, inadequate access to the internet at some places, system integration and readiness, and dual reporting using the paper-based format. CONCLUSIONS: The EIR is beneficial and helpful for monitoring vaccination coverage. Implementation and adoption of ASIK as Indonesia's first EIR still faces challenges related to human resources and digital infrastructure as the country transitions from paper-based reports to electronic or digital immunization reports. Continuous improvement, collaboration, and monitoring efforts are crucial to encourage the use of the EIR in Indonesia.","Aisyah DN, Utami A, Rahman FM, Adriani NH, Fitransyah F, Endryantoro MTA, Hutapea PY, Tandy G, Manikam L, Kozlakidis Z",Interact J Med Res,2025 Mar 27,Measles AND Indonesia
12041556,Measles immunization acceptance in Southeast Asia: past patterns and future challenges.,"Despite substantial increases in immunization rates, measles remains a major health problem in developing countries of Southeast Asia. The authors of this paper undertook separate investigations which examined factors influencing measles immunization acceptance in the rural Philippines, Central Java, Indonesia, and an impoverished neighborhood in Bangkok, Thailand. We briefly summarize the findings of our three field investigations before presenting a synthesizing analysis of the psychosocial and demographic factors which affect measles immunization. We then review trends influencing measles acceptance in industrialized countries to anticipate possible future challenges to measles immunization acceptance in Southeast Asia in an era of increasing globalization and information transfer. We suggest that parental perceptions of the risks and benefits of immunization, philosophical and religious convictions and state and social regulatory policies will profoundly influence measles immunization in the new millennium.","Serquina-Ramiro L, Kasniyah N, Inthusoma T, Higginbotham N, Streiner D, Nichter M, Freeman S",Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health,2001 Dec,Measles AND Indonesia
16723297,Adolescents' use of maternal and child health services in developing countries.,"CONTEXT: Because of high levels of early childbearing in developing countries, pregnancy and childbirth are the leading causes of death among women aged 15-19. Use of skilled antenatal and delivery care improves maternal outcomes through the prevention, management and treatment of obstetric complications, and infant immunizations prevent many childhood diseases. METHODS: Logistic regression analysis of Demographic and Health Survey data for 15 developing countries examined adolescents' use of antenatal care, delivery care and infant immunization services compared with use by older women. RESULTS: In general, the use of maternal and child health care did not vary by mother's age. In five of the 15 countries, women aged 18 or younger were less likely than women aged 19-23 to use either antenatal care or delivery care, or both (odds ratios, 0.5-0.9). Younger mothers in six countries were less likely than older mothers to have their infants immunized, particularly for diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus and for measles (0.5-0.8). The association of age and health care use was largely limited to Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nicaragua, Peru and Uganda. In Latin America, controlling for parity allowed differences between adolescents and older women to emerge. Except in Uganda, there were no differences in health care use by mother's age in the African countries. CONCLUSION: Country-specific investigations are needed in Asia to better understand the reasons for differences in service use by age. In general, further systematic evidence would help identify long-term interventions that will be most effective in increasing adolescents' use of maternal and child health services.","Reynolds HW, Wong EL, Tucker H",Int Fam Plan Perspect,2006 Mar,Measles AND Indonesia
34471086,Megadose Methylprednisolone for Immune Thrombocytopenia in an Infant Positive for SARS-CoV-2: A Case Report.,"BACKGROUND Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is rare in infants under 1 year old. Bleeding often occurs when the platelet count is <20 000/uL. The disease can progress because of accompanying COVID-19 disease. CASE REPORT A 9-month-old boy, weighing 8.5 kg, came to the hospital with petechiae on the forehead, cheeks, mouth, and extremities. The patient had rhinorrhea for 3 days previously and was febrile, pale, weak, and could not drink. He had the measles-rubella vaccination 19 days prior. Physical examination showed no abnormalities of the eyes, ears, nose, throat, and mouth. Heart and lungs were within normal limits, with no organomegaly, lymphadenopathy, or congenital anomaly of the abdomen. Laboratory examination showed hemoglobin, 12.7 g/dL; leukocytes, 7420/uL; platelet count, 16 000/uL; and hematocrit, 37.9%. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 14 mm at 1 h and 21 mm at 2 h. Peripheral blood smear showed normal RBC morphology, normal leukocytes, and few platelets. IgG was reactive and IgM was nonreactive on rapid antibody test. RT-PCR was positive for SARS-COV-2. Chest-X-ray showed pneumonia. The diagnosis was newly diagnosed ITP with COVID-19. Patient was treated with 30 mg/kg body weight/day of IV methylprednisolone for 3 days (250 mg); then 20 mg/kg body weight/day (175 mg) orally for 4 days in 3 divided doses. Azithromycin 100 mg/day, zinc 20 mg/day, and vitamin C 50 mg/day orally were also given. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 screening is highly recommended during this pandemic to identify it as a potential cause of childhood ITP. Megadose methylprednisolone had an excellent response in alleviating ITP with confirmed COVID-19 in an infant.","Ringoringo HP, Hartoyo E",Am J Case Rep,2021 Sep 2,Measles AND Indonesia
6774826,Cost-effectiveness of an immunization programme in Indonisia.,"The economic analysis reported below, based on hypothetical estimates of the programme impact, indicates that an expanded programme of immunization for diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and tuberculosis can be expected to be highly cost-effective in comparison with treatment. Sensitivity tests illustrate that this conclusion remains valid even when costs are increased by 20% and benefits reduced by 50%. A separate analysis was made of the DPT-tetanus toxoid and BCG components of the programme. The analysis revealed that although the BCG programme may not be justifiable when operated independently, its inclusion in a joint immunization programme is strongly justifiable on economic grounds (assuming a vaccine efficacy of 0.5). This result confirms one of the basic arguments advanced for the WHO programmes of expanded immunization and illustrates that other immunizations, such as for poliomyelitis and measles, which may not be cost-efficient by themselves may be economically justifiable when included as part of a larger immunization programme.","Barnum HN, Tarantola D, Setiady IF",Bull World Health Organ,1980,Measles AND Indonesia
31192732,"Does Complete Basic Immunization Correlate with Pneumonia Incidents in Children under Five Years in Depok, Indonesia?","Pneumonia is the first globally infectious disease causing death in children under five years of age in which the discovery of cases has increased in Indonesia in recent years. Immunization is a major preventive effort against the disease and is administered through the DPT, Hib, measles, PCV, and rotavirus vaccines. The aim of this study was to understand the correlation between complete basic immunization administration, parental characteristics, and the characteristics of children under five years with the incidence of pneumonia among children in this age group in Depok, Indonesia. The study used a cross-sectional design. There were 104 samples chosen by consecutive sampling. The study was conducted at the public health center in Depok between April and June of 2018. The data collection used questionnaires, parental characteristics, characteristics of children under five years, and complete basic immunization data for the children, which was arranged by the researchers. The questionnaire was tested for validity and reliability. The results of the study showed that complete basic immunization (p: 0.000, alpha: 0.05), age (p: 0.002, alpha: 0.05), and nutritional status (p: 0.043, alpha: 0.05) had a significant correlation with the incidence of pneumonia in children under five years. Health education about the importance of complete basic immunization and balanced nutrition needs to be given to parents who have under-five years of age.","Setiyowati W, Nurhaeni N",Compr Child Adolesc Nurs,2019,Measles AND Indonesia
39830042,"The Oncogenic Human Papillomavirus Involvement as a Risk Factor of Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccine Immunotherapy Failure in Anogenital Warts.","Anogenital warts (AGW) including multiple types of human papillomavirus (HPV) are prevalent. In this context, oncogenic HPV infection leads to anogenital cancers and the lesion is more persistent. Several research on AGW therapy with measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine injections have been successful without adverse effects. However, the effects of MMR immunotherapy for AGW on multiple HPV infections have not been reported. This research is a case report of AGW in a 17-year-old male treated with MMR. The inclusion criteria specified young age, indicative of a strong immunological status. Meanwhile, the exclusion criteria comprised immunocompromised conditions, such as HIV confirmed to be negative. Dermatological examination showed that the pubic region and penile shaft presented 51 verrucous papules for 6 months, with histopathological results supporting the diagnosis of AGW. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) examination reported the inclusion of HPV types 6, 11, and 16. The subcutaneous MMR vaccine was injected into the deltoid area every 2 weeks for three sessions. Meanwhile, the treatment response was assessed by counting the number and measuring the size of the lesion. After three sessions of MMR immunotherapy, there was no improvement in the size or quantity of lesions. Based on previous reports, a higher clearance rate for MMR immunotherapy was found in warts with a duration of < 6 months, while oncogenic HPV genotypes, particularly HPV type 16, take longer to clear than others. The efficacy of subcutaneous MMR injection for AGW treatment was unfavorable due to oncogenic HPV types. AGW treated with MMR immunotherapy should investigate oncogenic HPV genotype. However, further research needs to be carried out to justify this conclusion due to the limitations.","Achdiat PA, Ismiranty D, Hindritiani R, Rizqandaru T, Usman HA, Maharani RH",Int Med Case Rep J,2025,Measles AND Indonesia
24652461,"A comparative analysis of avoidable causes of childhood blindness in Malaysia with low income, middle income and high income countries.","To determine the avoidable causes of childhood blindness in Malaysia and to compare this to other middle income countries, low income countries and high income countries. Data were obtained from a school of the blind study by Patel et al. and analysed for avoidable causes of childhood blindness. Six other studies with previously published data on childhood blindness in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Indonesia, China and the United Kingdom were reviewed for avoidable causes. Comparisons of data and limitations of the studies are described. Prevalence of avoidable causes of childhood blindness in Malaysia is 50.5 % of all the cases of childhood blindness, whilst in the poor income countries such as Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Nigeria and Indonesia, the prevalence was in excess of 60 %. China had a low prevalence, but this is largely due to the fact that most schools were urban, and thus did not represent the situation of the country. High income countries had the lowest prevalence of avoidable childhood blindness. In middle income countries, such as Malaysia, cataract and retinopathy of prematurity are the main causes of avoidable childhood blindness. Low income countries continue to struggle with infections such as measles and nutritional deficiencies, such as vitamin A, both of which are the main contributors to childhood blindness. In high income countries, such as the United Kingdom, these problems are almost non-existent.","Koay CL, Patel DK, Tajunisah I, Subrayan V, Lansingh VC",Int Ophthalmol,2015 Apr,Measles AND Indonesia
11376847,Genetic analysis of Asian measles virus strains--new endemic genotype in Nepal.,"In many parts of Asia measles virus (MV) continues to be endemic. However, little is known about the genetic characteristics of viruses circulating on this continent. This study reports the molecular epidemiological analysis based on the entire nucleocapsid (N) and hemagglutinin (H) genes of the first isolates from Nepal and Taiwan, as well as of recent MV strains from India, Indonesia, and China. Four isolates collected in various regions in Nepal during 1999 belonged to a new genotype, tentatively called D8. Another Nepalese isolate and one from India belonged to genotype D4. The diversity of the Nepalese strains indicated that measles continues to be endemic in this country. The isolate from Taiwan grouped with D3 viruses and one Chinese strain isolated in The Netherlands was assigned to the previously described clade H, known to be endemic in Mainland China. Molecular characterization emerges as an important tool for monitoring virus endemicity and vaccination efforts.","Truong AT, Mulders MN, Gautam DC, Ammerlaan W, de Swart RL, King CC, Osterhaus AD, Muller CP",Virus Res,2001 Jul,Measles AND Indonesia

1678445,"Randomised, controlled trial of effectiveness of ampicillin in mild acute respiratory infections in Indonesian children.","The recommended treatment for mild acute respiratory infections (ARI) in children is supportive care only, but many physicians, especially in developing countries, continue to prescribe antibiotic treatment because they believe it prevents progression to more severe ARI. To find out whether ampicillin treatment conferred any benefit over supportive care alone, a randomised, controlled trial was carried out among 889 children (under 5 years) with mild ARI in Indonesia. 447 were randomly allocated ampicillin (25-30 mg/kg body weight three times daily for 5 days) plus supportive care (continued breastfeeding, clearing of the nose, and paracetamol to control fever); 442 were allocated supportive care only. The treatment groups were almost identical after randomisation in terms of age, sex, level of parental education, history of measles immunisation, and fever. After 1 week the percentages cured were nearly identical (204 [46%] ampicillin; 209 [47%] control), as were the percentages of cases progressing to moderate ARI (56 [13%] vs 53 [12%]). The effect of treatment was not modified by age, sex, measles immunisation status, or the educational level of the parents. At the 2-week follow-up, the percentages cured were 62% (277) in the ampicillin group and 58% (256) in the control group; 14% of both groups had progressed to moderate ARI; and 24% (107) and 28% (123), respectively, still had mild ARI. None of the differences in outcome between the ampicillin and control groups was statistically significant. Thus, ampicillin plus supportive care offers no benefit over supportive care alone for treatment of mild ARI in young Indonesian children.","Sutrisna B, Frerichs RR, Reingold AL",Lancet,1991 Aug 24,Measles AND Indonesia

11242822,Low-cost on-the-job peer training of nurses improved immunization coverage in Indonesia.,"In Indonesia responsibility for immunizations is placed on local government health centres and on the nurses who provide the immunizations at each centre. An on-the-job peer training programme for these nurses, which was designed to improve the immunization performance of poorly performing health centres in terms of coverage and practice in Maluku province, was evaluated. Experienced immunization nurses were sent to health centres where nurses were inexperienced or performing poorly; the experienced nurses spent 1-2 weeks providing on-the-job training for the less experienced ones. An evaluation of the 13 centres that participated in the programme and the 95 that did not found that the programme increased both immunization coverage and the quality of practice. Coverage of diphtheria/pertussis/tetanus (DPT), polio, and measles vaccinations rose by about 39% in all 13 participating centres when compared with non-participating centres, and by about 54% in the 11 centres that had a functioning transportation system during the year after training. These results reflect increases in the actual number of doses given and improvements in the accuracy of reports. Potential threats to the study's validity were examined and found not to be significant. The out-of-pocket cost of the training programme was about US$ 53 per trainee or about US$ 0.05 per additional vaccine reported to have been given. The marginal cost per additional fully immunized child was estimated to be US$ 0.50.","Robinson JS, Burkhalter BR, Rasmussen B, Sugiono R",Bull World Health Organ,2001,Measles AND Indonesia

The aims of this study were to compare the seroprevalence of rubella antibodies between Taiwan-born and foreign-born pregnant women and evaluate the effect of rubella vaccination program in Taiwan. We reviewed the rubella antibody test results of 5007 women during routine pregnancy check-ups at Fooyin University Hospital during 1999-2002. In Taiwan-born women, rubella antibody was undetectable in 29.2%, 7.3%, and 8.3% of the cohorts born before 1971, between 1971 and 1976, and after 1976, respectively. In the cohorts born between 1971 and 1976 and after 1976, pregnant women born in China, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Philippines had significant higher chances of being susceptible. Our results suggested that the voluntary adult vaccination program was not as effective as the school or wipe-out programs. Both Taiwanese women born before 1971 and foreign-born women were more likely to be susceptible to rubella. The introduction of 'catch-up' immunization program and enforcement of the checking of immunization record and/or blood test before pregnancy for these women are necessary in preventing CRS.","Tseng HF, Chang CK, Tan HF, Yang SE, Chang HW",Vaccine,2006 Jul 17,Measles AND Indonesia

2077467,Miliary tuberculosis in children. A clinical review.,"Eighty cases of miliary tuberculosis admitted to our hospital between January 1981 and December 1984 were reviewed. The age of the patients ranged from 3 months to 12 years, with an average of 2 years 2 months (26.5 months). Nine cases (11.25%) died during hospitalization due to the severe condition at the time of admission. Only 8 patients (10%) were in good nutritional condition. Seventy-two patients (90%) had been visiting the primary health care clinic for several times since 2-3 months but were never diagnosed as suffering from tuberculosis. Fever or recurrent fever were found in 78 cases (97.5%), anorexia in 65 cases (81.3%), chronic and/or recurrent cough in 72 cases (90%) and malaise in 43 (53.8%). Forty-one (51.3%) denied the presence of a close contact with source of infection. Hepatomegaly was found in 44 cases (55%), 19 (23.8%) of which were associated with splenomegaly. Choroidal tubercle was found in 4 cases; 1 case with coxitis, 1 with brain tuberculoma, 1 with ascites, 1 with endobronchitis and 1 with hepatitis. Forty-three (53.8%) were tuberculin negatives, 24 of which become positives after treatment. Fourteen cases had BCG scar. History of measles was found in 21 cases. Children with longterm and recurrent fever, anorexia, decrease of body weight and recurrent cough should be suspected of having TB thus enabling to get an early diagnosis.",Rahajoe NN,Paediatr Indones,1990 Sep-Oct,Measles AND Indonesia

Key aspects were the procurement of low-cost HB vaccine, integration into routine infant immunization services, and delivery of the first dose in the home within 1 week of birth. The project achieved > 90% coverage with 3 doses of vaccine. The prevalence of HB surface antigen was 1.4% in infants who received 3 doses (with the first dose within 7 days of birth) and 3.0% in those who received the first dose > 7 days after birth, compared with a baseline prevalence of 6.2% (P < .001 in each case). Most vaccine failures occurred in children born to HBe antigen-positive mothers. Antibody prevalence and titers did not correlate with protection. HB vaccine can be successfully integrated into the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), strengthening the EPI and significantly reducing chronic HB infection.","Ruff TA, Gertig DM, Otto BF, Gust ID, Sutanto A, Soewarso TI, Kandun N, Marschner IC, Maynard JE",J Infect Dis,1995 Feb,Measles AND Indonesia

This clinical practice guidelines aim to assist clinicians in all disciplines involved in the use of immunosuppressive therapy to effectively prevent and manage hepatitis B reactivation. METHODS: All publications related to hepatitis B reactivation with the use of immunosuppressive therapy since 1975 were reviewed. Advice from key opinion leaders in member countries/administrative regions of Asian-Pacific Association for the study of the liver was collected and synchronized. Immunosuppressive therapy was risk-stratified according to its reported rate of hepatitis B reactivation. RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend the necessity to screen all patients for hepatitis B prior to the initiation of immunosuppressive therapy and to administer pre-emptive nucleos(t)ide analogues to those patients with a substantial risk of hepatitis and acute-on-chronic liver failure due to hepatitis B reactivation.,"Lau G, Yu ML, Wong G, Thompson A, Ghazinian H, Hou JL, Piratvisuth T, Jia JD, Mizokami M, Cheng G, Chen GF, Liu ZW, Baatarkhuu O, Cheng AL, Ng WL, Lau P, Mok T, Chang JM, Hamid S, Dokmeci AK, Gani RA, Payawal DA, Chow P, Park JW, Strasser SI, Mohamed R, Win KM, Tawesak T, Sarin SK, Omata M",Hepatol Int,2021 Oct,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
31852635,Liver diseases in the Asia-Pacific region: a Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology Commission.,"The Asia-Pacific region is home to more than half of the global population and accounted for 62.6% of global deaths due to liver diseases in 2015. 54.3% of global deaths due to cirrhosis, 72.7% of global deaths due to hepatocellular carcinoma, and more than two-thirds of the global burden of acute viral hepatitis occurred in this region in 2015. Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection caused more than half of the deaths due to cirrhosis in the region, followed by alcohol consumption (20.8%), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD; 12.1%), and chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV; 15.7%). In 2015, HBV accounted for about half the cases of hepatocellular carcinoma in the region. Preventive strategies for viral hepatitis-related liver disease include increasing access to clean drinking water and sanitation. HBV vaccination programmes for neonates have been implemented by all countries, although birth-dose coverage is extremely suboptimal in some. Availability of screening tests for blood and tissue, donor recall policies, and harm reduction strategies are in their initial stages in most countries. Many governments have put HBV and HCV drugs on their essential medicines lists and the availability of generic versions of these drugs has reduced costs. Efforts to eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat, together with the rapid increase in per-capita alcohol consumption in countries and the epidemic of obesity, are expected to change the spectrum of liver diseases in the Asia-Pacific region in the near future. The increasing burden of alcohol-related liver diseases can be contained through government policies to limit consumption and promote less harmful patterns of alcohol use, which are in place in some countries but need to be enforced more strictly. Steps are needed to control obesity and NAFLD, including policies to promote healthy lifestyles and regulate the food industry. Inadequate infrastructure and insufficient health-care personnel trained in liver diseases are issues that also need to be addressed in the Asia-Pacific region. The policy response of most governments to liver diseases has thus far been inadequate and poorly funded. There must be a renewed focus on prevention, early detection, timely referral, and research into the best means to introduce and improve health interventions to reduce the burden of liver diseases in the Asia-Pacific region.","Sarin SK, Kumar M, Eslam M, George J, Al Mahtab M, Akbar SMF, Jia J, Tian Q, Aggarwal R, Muljono DH, Omata M, Ooka Y, Han KH, Lee HW, Jafri W, Butt AS, Chong CH, Lim SG, Pwu RF, Chen DS",Lancet Gastroenterol Hepatol,2020 Feb,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
39961976,Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF): the 'Kyoto Consensus'-steps from Asia.,"Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a condition associated with high mortality in the absence of liver transplantation. There have been various definitions proposed worldwide. The first consensus report of the working party of the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL) set in 2004 on ACLF was published in 2009, and the ""APASL ACLF Research Consortium (AARC)"" was formed in 2012. The AARC database has prospectively collected nearly 10,500 cases of ACLF from various countries in the Asia-Pacific region. This database has been instrumental in developing the AARC score and grade of ACLF, the concept of the 'Golden Therapeutic Window', the 'transplant window', and plasmapheresis as a treatment modality. Also, the data has been key to identifying pediatric ACLF. The European Association for the Study of Liver-Chronic Liver Failure (EASL CLIF) and the North American Association for the Study of the End Stage Liver Disease (NACSELD) from the West added the concepts of organ failure and infection as precipitants for the development of ACLF and CLIF-Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and NACSELD scores for prognostication. The Chinese Group on the Study of Severe Hepatitis B (COSSH) added COSSH-ACLF criteria to manage hepatitis b virus-ACLF with and without cirrhosis. The literature supports these definitions to be equally effective in their respective cohorts in identifying patients with high mortality. To overcome the differences and to develop a global consensus, APASL took the initiative and invited the global stakeholders, including opinion leaders from Asia, EASL and AASLD, and other researchers in the field of ACLF to identify the key issues and develop an evidence-based consensus document. The consensus document was presented in a hybrid format at the APASL annual meeting in Kyoto in March 2024. The 'Kyoto APASL Consensus' presented below carries the final recommendations along with the relevant background information and areas requiring future studies.","Choudhury A, Kulkarni AV, Arora V, Soin AS, Dokmeci AK, Chowdhury A, Koshy A, Duseja A, Kumar A, Mishra AK, Patwa AK, Sood A, Roy A, Shukla A, Chan A, Krag A, Mukund A, Mandot A, Goel A, Butt AS, Sahney A, Shrestha A, Cardenas A, Di Giorgio A, Arora A, Anand AC, Dhawan A, Jindal A, Saraya A, Srivastava A, Kumar A, Kaewdech A, Pande A, Rastogi A, Valsan A, Goel A, Kumar A, Singal AK, Tanaka A, Coilly A, Singh A, Meena BL, Jagadisan B, Sharma BC, Lal BB, Eapen CE, Yaghi C, Kedarisetty CK, Kim CW, Panackel C, Yu C, Kalal CR, Bihari C, Huang CH, Vasishtha C, Jansen C, Strassburg C, Lin CY, Karvellas CJ, Lesmana CRA, Philips CA, Shawcross D, Kapoor D, Agrawal D, Payawal DA, Praharaj DL, Jothimani D, Song DS, Kim DJ, Kim DS, Zhongping D, Karim F, Durand F, Shiha GE, D'Amico G, Lau GK, Pati GK, Narro GEC, Lee GH, Adali G, Dhakal GP, Szabo G, Lin HC, Li H, Nair HK, Devarbhavi H, Tevethia H, Ghazinian H, Ilango H, Yu HL, Hasan I, Fernandez J, George J, Behari J, Fung J, Bajaj J, Benjamin J, Lai JC, Jia J, Hu JH, Chen JJ, Hou JL, Yang JM, Chang J, Trebicka J, Kalf JC, Sollano JD, Varghese J, Arab JP, Li J, Reddy KR, Raja K, Panda K, Kajal K, Kumar K, Madan K, Kalista KF, Thanapirom K, Win KM, Suk KT, Devadas K, Lesmana LA, Kamani L, Premkumar M, Niriella MA, Al Mahtab M, Yuen MF, Sayed MH, Alla M, Wadhawan M, Sharma MK, Sahu M, Prasad M, Muthiah MD, Schulz M, Bajpai M, Reddy MS, Praktiknjo M, Yu ML, Prasad M, Sharma M, Elbasiony M, Eslam M, Azam MG, Rela M, Desai MS, Vij M, Mahmud N, Choudhary NS, Marannan NK, Ormeci N, Saraf N, Verma N, Nakayama N, Kawada N, Oidov Baatarkhuu, Goyal O, Yokosuka O, Rao PN, Angeli P, Parikh P, Kamath PS, Thuluvath PJ, Lingohr P, Ranjan P, Bhangui P, Rathi P, Sakhuja P, Puri P, Ning Q, Dhiman RK, Kumar R, Vijayaraghavan R, Khanna R, Maiwall R, Mohanka R, Moreau R, Gani RA, Loomba R, Mehtani R, Rajaram RB, Hamid SS, Palnitkar S, Lal S, Biswas S, Chirapongsathorn S, Agarwal S, Sachdeva S, Saigal S, Kumar SE, Violeta S, Singh SP, Mochida S, Mukewar S, Alam S, Lim SG, Alam S, Shalimar, Venishetty S, Sundaram SS, Shetty S, Bhatia S, Singh SA, Kottilil S, Strasser S, Shasthry SM, Maung ST, Tan SS, Treeprasertsuk S, Asthana S, Manekeller S, Gupta S, Acharya SK, K C S, Maharshi S, Asrani S, Dadhich S, Taneja S, Giri S, Singh S, Chen T, Gupta T, Kanda T, Tanwandee T, Piratvishuth T, Spengler U, Prasad VGM, Midha V, Rakhmetova V, Arroyo V, Sood V, Br VK, Wong VW, Pamecha V, Singh V, Dayal VM, Saraswat VA, Kim W, Jafri W, Gu W, Jun WY, Qi X, Chawla YK, Kim YJ, Shi Y, Abbas Z, Kumar G, Shiina S, Wei L, Omata M, Sarin SK",Hepatol Int,2025 Feb,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
29201773,Epidemiology of Hepatitis B and C in Republic of Indonesia.,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections pose serious problems in terms of public health and clinical intervention in a country with approximately 250 million people, who live in more than 17,000 islands. Efforts to combat HBV and HCV have been made through the implementation of universal infant hepatitis B immunization, blood screening, and other health promotion actions, and building epidemiological data to develop intervention strategies. A nationwide study in 2013 revealed hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) prevalence of 7.1%, which indicates that Indonesia has moved from high to moderate endemicity of hepatitis B, leaving the prevalence of 9.4% in 2007. The occurrences of new hepatitis B cases still continue in early childhood period, which may root from low coverage of birth-dose hepatitis B immunization in remote islands, and the potential mother-to-child transmission of HBV from HBsAg-positive pregnant mothers. Other problems still exist including the high HBV infection rates among young adults in remote islands, the presence of occult hepatitis B, as well as the substantial prevalence of HCV infection in general population, who do not have access to diagnosis and treatment. Effective preventive and control strategies are being developed tailored to the local capacity, infrastructures, socioeconomics, and culture, as well as geographical aspects of the country.

36851280,Barriers to and Facilitators of Hepatitis B Vaccination among the Adult Population in Indonesia: A Mixed Methods Study.,"To reach the goals of the Global Hepatitis Elimination 2030 program, Indonesia is now preparing a new regulation for hepatitis B vaccinations for adult population. This study aimed to determine the factors influencing vaccine uptake for hepatitis B in the adult population, and identify barriers to, and facilitators of, hepatitis B vaccination programmes. An explanatory sequential mixed methods design was implemented in this study. We conducted a survey involving 893 participants in the general population followed by 14 in-depth interviews with health providers. The survey found that only 15% (95% confidence interval 13-18%) of participants received at least one dose of the hepatitis B vaccine. Factors associated with vaccine uptake were, living in Yogyakarta compared to living in Aceh, having secondary and higher education compared to primary education, working as a health worker compared to working in other sectors, and having health insurance that covered hepatitis B vaccination compared to not having such health insurance. Our qualitative study also identified several barriers to the adult hepatitis B vaccination programme in Indonesia such as the high cost of vaccination, lack of vaccine availability in certain areas, limited human resources to implement the hepatitis B vaccination programme, and the ineffective dissemination of hepatitis B vaccination. This study highlights that accessibility and affordability of vaccinations are important determinants of vaccination uptake that should be taken into account when planning vaccination campaigns.","Machmud PB, Fuhrer A, Gottschick C, Mikolajczyk R",Vaccines (Basel),2023 Feb 9,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
39147893,"Liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma in the Asia-Pacific region: burden, trends, challenges and future directions.","Globally, nearly half of deaths from cirrhosis and chronic liver diseases (CLD) and three-quarters of deaths from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occur in the Asia-Pacific region. Chronic hepatitis B is responsible for the vast majority of liver-related deaths in the region. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the most common form of CLD, affecting an estimated 30% of the adult population. Compared with people of European descent, people from the Asia-Pacific region carry more genetic variants associated with MASLD and its progression. Alcohol is a fast-growing cause of CLD and HCC in Asia as a result of the rising per-capita consumption of alcohol. Drug-induced liver injury is under-recognized and probably has a high prevalence in this region. The epidemiological and outcome data of acute-on-chronic liver failure are heterogeneous, and non-unified definitions across regions contribute to this heterogeneity. CLDs are severely underdiagnosed, and effective treatments and vaccinations are underutilized. In this Review, we highlight trends in the burden of CLD and HCC in the Asia-Pacific region and discuss the rapidly changing aetiologies of liver disease. We examine the multiple gaps in the care cascade and propose mitigating strategies and future directions.","Mak LY, Liu K, Chirapongsathorn S, Yew KC, Tamaki N, Rajaram RB, Panlilio MT, Lui R, Lee HW, Lai JC, Kulkarni AV, Premkumar M, Lesmana CRA, Hsu YC, Huang DQ",Nat Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol,2024 Dec,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
38367629,Progress towards elimination of viral hepatitis: a Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology Commission update.,"The top 20 highest burdened countries (in disability-adjusted life years) account for more than 75% of the global burden of viral hepatitis. An effective response in these 20 countries is crucial if global elimination targets are to be achieved. In this update of the Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology Commission on accelerating the elimination of viral hepatitis, we convene national experts from each of the top 20 highest burdened countries to provide an update on progress. Although the global burden of diseases is falling, progress towards elimination varies greatly by country. By use of a hepatitis elimination policy index conceived as part of the 2019 Commission, we measure countries' progress towards elimination. Progress in elimination policy has been made in 14 of 20 countries with the highest burden since 2018, with the most substantial gains observed in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Japan, and Russia. Most improvements are attributable to the publication of formalised national action plans for the elimination of viral hepatitis, provision of publicly funded screening programmes, and government subsidisation of antiviral treatments. Key themes that emerged from discussion between national commissioners from the highest burdened countries build on the original recommendations to accelerate the global elimination of viral hepatitis. These themes include the need for simplified models of care, improved access to appropriate diagnostics, financing initiatives, and rapid implementation of lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cooke GS, Flower B, Cunningham E, Marshall AD, Lazarus JV, Palayew A, Jia J, Aggarwal R, Al-Mahtab M, Tanaka Y, Jeong SH, Poovorawan K, Waked I, Hiebert L, Khue PM, Grebely J, Alcantara-Payawal D, Sanchez-Avila JF, Mbendi C, Muljono DH, Lesi O, Desalegn H, Hamid S, de Araujo A, Cheinquer H, Onyekwere CA, Malyuta R, Ivanchuk I, Thomas DL, Pimenov N, Chulanov V, Dirac MA, Han H, Ward JW",Lancet Gastroenterol Hepatol,2024 Apr,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
34851983,Seroprevalence and incidence of hepatitis A in Southeast Asia: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: A previous review on hepatitis A virus (HAV) seroprevalence in 2005 categorized Southeast Asia as a low HAV endemicity region. In 2010, the World Health Organization modified this from low to low/medium endemicity, pointing out that these estimates were based on limited evidence. Since then, there has been no attempt to review HAV epidemiology from this region. We conducted a systematic review of literature to collect information on HAV incidence and seroprevalence in select countries in the Southeast Asian region, specifically, The Association of Southeast Asian Nations over the last 20 years. METHODOLOGY: This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. From the relevant articles, we extracted data and conducted a risk of bias assessment of individual studies. RESULTS: The search yielded 22 and 13 publications on HAV seroprevalence and incidence, respectively. Overall, our findings point to a very low HAV endemicity profile in Thailand and Singapore and evidence of a shift towards low HAV endemicity in Indonesia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Only Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines have existing HAV disease surveillance and reported incidence rates below 1 per 100,000. Several outbreaks with varying magnitude documented in the region provide insights into the evolving epidemiology of HAV in the region. Risk of bias assessment of studies revealed that the individual studies were of low to medium risk. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The available HAV endemicity profiles in Southeast Asian countries, aside from Thailand, are limited and outdated, but suggest an endemicity shift in the region that is not fully documented yet. These findings highlight the need to update information on HAV epidemiology through strengthening of disease surveillance mechanisms to confirm the shift in HAV endemicity in the region.","Hernandez-Suarez G, Saha D, Lodrono K, Boonmahittisut P, Taniwijaya S, Saha A, Badur S, Poovorawan Y",PLoS One,2021,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
37999611,"Evaluation of Process Indicators and Challenges of the Elimination of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV, Syphilis, and Hepatitis B in Bali Province, Indonesia (2019-2022): A Mixed Methods Study.","BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to describe the prevalence of and evaluate the processes and challenges in implementing the elimination of HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B transmission from mother to child in Bali Province, Indonesia. METHODS: The research method used is a descriptive approach using indicators and a set of processes by the WHO, quantitative methods using descriptive analysis, and qualitative methods using phenomenological paradigms through in-depth interviews and FGD with healthcare professionals involved in the elimination of mother-to-child transmission (EMTCT) program. RESULTS: The indicators that have successfully met the target for 4 years are antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage in Badung District (>/=95%) and ANC coverage (at least one visit) in Buleleng District (>/=95%). The study found low prevalence rates of HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B among pregnant women in the three districts. There are some indicators that show improvement from 2019 to 2022, namely, syphilis (60.44% to 86.98%) and hepatitis B (29.03% to 95.35%) screening coverage showed improvements, with increasing screening rates observed in Buleleng District. However, adequate treatment coverage for pregnant women with syphilis decreased in Denpasar City in 2022 compared to 2019 (100% to 71.28%). Despite data on hepatitis B treatment being unavailable, hepatitis B vaccination coverage exceeded the WHO target in all three districts. The utilization of the information system is not yet optimal, and there is a lack of ability to track cases. Furthermore, there is insufficient involvement of the private sector, particularly in screening, and a lack of standardized procedures in the management of referrals for pregnant women with hepatitis B. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B among pregnant women has consistently remained below the Ministry of Health's target for four years. Despite this, there are a lot of targets, and the indicator EMTCT process has yet to reach the WHO target. The challenges for each district in reaching the WHO target include providing syphilis and hepatitis B reagents and benzatine penicillin; increasing private sector involvement; and strengthening information systems, policies, and guidelines for the management of hepatitis B among pregnant women in line with WHO recommendations to achieve EMTCT.","Armini LN, Setiawati EP, Arisanti N, Hilmanto D",Trop Med Infect Dis,2023 Nov 3,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
26478663,Hepatitis B virus infection in Indonesia.,"Approximately 240 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), 75% of whom reside in Asia. Approximately 600000 of infected patients die each year due to HBV-related diseases or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The endemicity of hepatitis surface antigen in Indonesia is intermediate to high with a geographical difference. The risk of HBV infection is high in hemodialysis (HD) patients, men having sex with men, and health care workers. Occult HBV infection has been detected in various groups such as blood donors, HD patients, and HIV-infected individuals and children. The most common HBV subgenotype in Indonesia is B3 followed by C1. Various novel subgenotypes of HBV have been identified throughout Indonesia, with the novel HBV subgenotypes C6-C16 and D6 being successfully isolated. Although a number of HBV subgenotypes have been discovered in Indonesia, genotype-related pathogenicity has not yet been elucidated in detail. Therefore, genotype-related differences in the prognosis of liver disease and their effects on treatments need to be determined. A previous study conducted in Indonesia revealed that hepatic steatosis was associated with disease progression. Pre-S2 mutations and mutations at C1638T and T1753V in HBV/B3 have been associated with advanced liver diseases including HCC. However, drug resistance to lamivudine, which is prominent in Indonesia, remains obscure. Although the number of studies on HBV in Indonesia has been increasing, adequate databases on HBV infection are limited. We herein provided an overview of the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of HBV infection in Indonesia.","Yano Y, Utsumi T, Lusida MI, Hayashi Y",World J Gastroenterol,2015 Oct 14,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia

Regular monitoring and vaccine efficacy of HAV are still lacking in different countries. This study aimed to investigate HAV and HEV prevalence in developed, developing, and least-developed Asian countries using wastewater as a surveillance tool. A total of 232 untreated wastewater samples were collected from six wastewater treatment plants, a sewage treatment plant, or an open drainage in six countries [Nepal (n = 51), Indonesia (n = 37), Thailand (n = 30), Vietnam (n = 27), the Philippines (n = 17), and Japan (n = 70)] between April and October 2022. Viruses in wastewater were concentrated by simple centrifugation or polyethylene glycol precipitation method, followed by viral RNA extraction and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. HAV and HEV RNA were detected in the samples from Nepal (51 % for HAV and 2 % for HEV), Thailand (3 % for both viruses), and Japan (1 % for HAV and 24 % for HEV). Only HAV RNA was found in 11 % of the samples in Indonesia, whereas only HEV RNA was detected in Vietnam and the Philippines, with a positive ratio of 15 % and 12 %, respectively. These results highlighted the geographic variability in HAV and HEV prevalence, underscoring the need for localized public health strategies to address specific viral hepatitis challenges in each country.","Raya S, Tandukar S, Kattel HP, Sharma S, Sangsanont J, Sirikanchana K, Ngo HTT, Inson JGM, Enriquez MLD, Alam ZF, Setiyawan AS, Setiadi T, Haramoto E",Sci Total Environ,2024 Nov 15,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia

In average the prevalence of clinical hepatitis in Indonesia was 0.6% in the year 2007. Of 82 clinical acute hepatitis patients treated in hospitals in several cities, acute hepatitis A accounted for 28.0%, acute hepatitis B 13.4%, and acute hepatitis C 1.2%; 35.4% patients were infected by unknown etiology. In 1980s, the prevalence of anti-HAV in the age group 10- to 14-years was almost 100% in smaller towns and 45 to 60% in big cities. About 30 years later, anti-HAV prevalence decreased to around 13% in the same smaller town. Outbreaks of hepatitis A were reported between 2006 and 2009 in several cities in Java island. The prevalence of HBsAg in the islands other than Java island (8.5%) was significantly higher than in Java island (4.9%). In 1,409 viremic subjects, 4 genotypes of HBV were found, i.e., genotype B (60%), followed by genotype C (33%), genotype D (7%), and genotype A (0.3%). In contrast, the prevalence of hepatitis C was much higher in Java island compared to other islands. In blood donors in Java island, the prevalence of anti-HCV and HCV RNA were 1.5 and 1.1% respectively, while in other islands, the prevalence were only 0.7 and 0.2% respectively.

27621573,Current hepatitis B virus infection situation in Indonesia and its genetic diversity.,"Indonesia has a moderate to high endemicity of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The risk for chronic HBV infection is highest among those infected during infancy. Since 1997, hepatitis B (HepB) vaccination of newborns has been fully integrated into the National Immunization Program. Although HBV infection has been reduced by the universal newborn HepB immunization program, it continues to occur in Indonesia. The low birth dose coverage and the presence of vaccine escape mutants might contribute to this endemicity among children. Although limited information is available for an analysis of occult HBV infection (OBI), several variations and substitutions in the pre-S/S region have been detected in Indonesian HBV strains. Additionally, persistent infection and disease progression of chronic hepatitis B are related to not only viral factors but also the host genome. Indonesia is one of the most ethnically heterogeneous nations, with Javanese and Sundanese as the two highest ethnic groups. This multi-ethnicity makes genomic research in Indonesia difficult. In this article, we focused on and reviewed the following aspects: the current hepatitis B immunization program and its efficacy, OBI, HBV infection among high-risk patients, such as hemodialysis patients, and research regarding the host genome in Indonesia.","Lusida MI, Juniastuti, Yano Y",World J Gastroenterol,2016 Aug 28,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia

The prevalence of HBsAg, antibody to HBV core antigen (anti-HBc), and antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) was 4.7, 18.5, and 36.7% respectively, while 57.3% were negative for all seromarkers, indicating susceptibility to this infection. Increasing trend with age was observed in the exposure to infection (anti-HBc) (p <0.001) and the marker of resolved infection (HBsAg-, anti-HBc+, anti-HBs+) (p = 0.004), suggesting accumulated exposure to HBV infection by increasing age. Rising trend of exposure rate was also observed across the administration, nonintervention, and intervention groups (p < 0.001). By length of service period, significant escalation of exposure (p = 0.010) and resolved infection (p < 0.001) were also observed, suggesting increasing occupational risk to HBV infection. There is an urgent need to safeguard the HCWs with hepatitis B vaccination and provide continuing education at various health care setups. The establishment of a national policy and a roadmap for effective and efficient intervention is required for the prevention, diagnosis, postexposure management, and treatment of HBV infection in this special population.

28404097,Hepatitis B and hepatitis C in southeast and southern Asia: challenges for governments.,"In 2015, the Coalition to Eradicate Viral Hepatitis in Asia Pacific gathered leading hepatitis experts from Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Thailand to discuss common challenges to the burden posed by hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), to learn from each other's experience, and identify sustainable approaches. In this report, we summarise these discussions. Countries differ in their policy responses to HBV and HCV; however, substantial systemic, cultural, and financial barriers to achievement of elimination of these infections persist in all countries. Common challenges to elimination include limited availability of reliable epidemiological data; insufficient public awareness of risk factors and modes of transmission, leading to underdiagnosis; high rates of transmission through infected blood products, including in medical settings; limited access to care for people who inject drugs; prevailing stigma and discrimination against people infected with viral hepatitis; and financial barriers to treatment and care. Despite these challenges, promising examples of effective programmes, public-private initiatives, and other innovative approaches are evident in all countries we studied in Asia Pacific. The draft WHO Global Health Sector Strategy on Viral Hepatitis 2016-21 provides a solid framework upon which governments can build their local strategies towards viral hepatitis. However, greater recognition by national governments and the international community of the urgency to comprehensively tackle both HBV and HCV are still needed. In all countries, strategic plans and policy goals need to be translated into resources and concrete actions, with national governments at the helm, to enable a sustainable response to the rising burden of hepatitis B and C in all countries.","Wait S, Kell E, Hamid S, Muljono DH, Sollano J, Mohamed R, Shah S, Mamun-Al-Mahtab, Abbas Z, Johnston J, Tanwandee T, Wallace J",Lancet Gastroenterol Hepatol,2016 Nov,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
29174317,"Status and progress of hepatitis B control through vaccination in the South-East Asia Region, 1992-2015.","In 2016, the Immunization Technical Advisory Group of the South-East Asia Region (SEAR) endorsed a regional goal to achieve </=1% prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) among 5-year-old children by 2020. Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is largely preventable with a birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine (HepB-BD) followed by two to three additional doses. We reviewed the progress towards hepatitis B control through vaccination in SEAR during 1992-2015. We summarized hepatitis B vaccination data and reviewed the literature to determine the prevalence of chronic HBV infection pre- and post-vaccine introduction. We used a mathematical model to determine post-vaccine prevalence of HBsAg among 5 year olds in countries lacking national serosurvey data and estimated the impact of vaccination on disease burden. Regional coverage with three doses of hepatitis B vaccine (HepB3) increased from 56% in 2011 to 87% in 2015. By 2016, 7 of 11 countries had introduced universal HepB-BD. Regional HepB-BD coverage increased from 9% in 2011 to 34% in 2015. In 2015, estimated HBsAg among 5 year olds was 1.1% with variability among countries. Myanmar (3.8%), Timor-Leste (2.7%), Indonesia (1.8%), and India (1%) had the highest prevalence of HBsAg. During 1992-2015, vaccination prevented approximately 16 million chronic HBV infections and 2.6 million related deaths. In 2015, around 197,640 perinatal HBV infections occurred in SEAR with majority occurring in India (62%), Bangladesh (24%), and Myanmar (8%). Myanmar had the highest rate of perinatal chronic HBV infections at 16 per 1000 live births. Despite significant progress in the control of HBV, SEAR needs to secure political commitment for elimination and consider additional strategies, such as promoting health facility births, universal birth dose administration, developing strong coordination between health sectors, and using alternative vaccine delivery methods, to improve HepB-BD coverage and subsequently achieve HBV control and elimination.","Childs L, Roesel S, Tohme RA",Vaccine,2018 Jan 2,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
25424941,Cost-effectiveness of hepatitis A vaccination in Indonesia.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of hepatitis A immunization in Indonesia, including an explicit comparison between one-dose and two-dose vaccines. METHODS: An age-structured cohort model based on a decision tree was developed for the 2012 Indonesia birth cohort. Using the model, we made a comparison on the use of two-dose and one-dose vaccines. The model involved a 70-year time horizon with 1-month cycles for children less than 2 years old and annually thereafter. Monte Carlo simulations were used to examine the economic acceptability and affordability of the hepatitis A vaccination. RESULTS: Vaccination would save US$ 3,795,148 and US$ 2,892,920 from the societal perspective, for the two-dose and one-dose vaccine schedules, respectively, in the context of hepatitis A treatment. It also would save 8917 and 6614 discounted quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs), respectively. With the vaccine price of US$ 3.21 per dose, the implementation of single dose vaccine would yield an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$ 4933 per QALY gained versus no vaccination, whereas the two-dose versus one-dose schedule would cost US$ 14 568 per QALY gained. Considering the 2012 gross-domestic-product (GDP) per capita in Indonesia of US$ 3557, the results indicate that hepatitis A vaccination would be a cost-effective intervention, both for the two-dose and one-dose vaccine schedules in isolation, but two-dose vaccination would no longer be cost-effective if one-dose vaccination is a feasible option. Vaccination would be 100% affordable at budgets of US$ 71,408 000 and US$ 37,690,000 for the implementation of the two-dose and one-dose vaccine schedules, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of hepatitis A vaccination in Indonesia would be a cost-effective health intervention under the market vaccine price. Given the budget limitations, the use of a one-dose-vaccine schedule would be more realistic to be applied than a two-dose schedule. The vaccine price, mortality rate and discount rate were the most influential parameters impacting the ICERs.","Suwantika AA, Beutels P, Postma MJ",Hum Vaccin Immunother,2014,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
39010774,Factors Associated with Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C among Infected Patients in Indonesia and Their Knowledge and Attitude: A Multicenter Observational Study.,"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are global health problems, including in Indonesia. The purpose of this study was to assess the knowledge and attitudes about HBV and HCV infection among infected patients in Indonesia. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used a questionnaire survey. The questionnaire was adapted and translated into Indonesian language, and trialed with 27 HBV and 27 HCV patients. The final validated questionnaire was later used in the target population. Patients diagnosed with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C were included. The patients were enrolled from November 2019 until February 2020 in sixteen multicenter locations. Multivariate analysis with logistic regression was conducted to determine the factors that are associated with the knowledge and attitude among HBV and HCV patients toward their illness. RESULTS: A total of 931 HBV patients and 254 HCV patients were included in this survey. The proportion of infected patients with adequate knowledge of Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C was 72.1% and 53.9%, respectively. Positive attitudes about Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C were 28.5% and 41.3%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that higher education level, higher income level, diagnosis duration of more than 5 years, and receiving of antiviral therapy were independent factors associated with adequate knowledge about Hepatitis B among HBV patients. Among HCV patients, independent factors associated with adequate knowledge about Hepatitis C were being married, higher education level, higher income level, and receiving antiviral therapy. Moreover, older age and receiving of antiviral therapy were independent factors associated with positive attitudes towards Hepatitis B among HBV patients. However, only higher education level was found to be an independent factor associated with positive attitudes towards Hepatitis C among HCV patients. CONCLUSION: The knowledge and attitude of patients regarding HBV and HCV were quite low among infected patients in Indonesia.","Kurniawan J, Aprilicia G, Purnomo HD, Permatawedi CO, Kholili U, Karo-Karo T, Widita H, Darmayani A, Widodo AN, Agustanti N, Miro S, Suyata S, Yusuf F, Triwikatmani C, Mustika S, Bachtiar RR, Gosal F, Mariadi IK, Hasan I",Acta Med Indones,2024 Apr,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
39164708,"Patient perspective on the elimination mother-to-child transmission of HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B in Bali, Indonesia: a qualitative study.","BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the facilitators and barriers to the elimination of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), syphilis, and hepatitis B transmission based on the perspectives of mothers living with HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B. METHODS: This study employed a descriptive, qualitative design. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with mothers living with HIV, syphilis, and/or hepatitis B virus. A total of 25 participants were included in the study. This study used a triangulation method conducted by members to enhance the validity and dependability of the findings. The study was conducted at referral hospitals and community health centers between September 2022 and February 2023. Data analysis utilized deductive content analysis and categorized themes based on a socio-ecological framework. RESULTS: The findings revealed facilitators and barriers across five levels of the socio-ecological framework and 21 subcategories. The findings included the following: (1) At the policy level, facilitators were mandatory testing programs, and barriers were separating testing services from antenatal care facilities. (2) At the community level, facilitators included the involvement of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and cross-sector support. Barriers included challenges faced by non-residents and fear of stigma and discrimination. (3) At the healthcare system level, facilitators included tracking and follow-up by midwives, positive relationships with healthcare providers, and satisfaction with healthcare services. Barriers included prolonged waiting times, insufficient information from healthcare providers, and administrative limitations. (4) At the interpersonal level, facilitators included partner and family support, open communication, and absence of stigma. Barriers included the reluctance of sexual partners to undergo screening. (5) At the individual level, facilitators included the desire for a healthy baby, adequate knowledge, self-acceptance, and commitment to a healthy lifestyle; barriers included the lack of administrative discipline. CONCLUSION: Mothers living with HIV, syphilis, or hepatitis B require tailored healthcare approaches. Healthcare professionals must understand and meet the needs of mothers within a comprehensive care continuum. The findings of this study advocate for the development and implementation of integrated care models that are responsive to the specific challenges and preferences of affected mothers, aiming to improve health outcomes for both mothers and their children.","Armini LN, Setiawati EP, Arisanti N, Hilmanto D",BMC Public Health,2024 Aug 20,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia

38902642,Impact of the 2008 economic crisis on the burden of hepatitis B and C diseases in Southern European countries.,"BACKGROUND: The economic crisis that began in 2008 has severely affected Southern (Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain) Western European (SWE) countries of Western Europe (WE) and may have affected ongoing efforts to eliminate viral hepatitis. This study was conducted to investigate the impact of the economic crisis on the burden of HBV and HCV disease. METHODS: Global Burden of Diseases 2019 data were used to analyse the rates of epidemiological metrics of HBV and HCV acute and chronic infections in SWE and WE. Time series modelling was performed to quantify the impact of healthcare expenditure on the time trend of HBV and HCV disease burden in 2000-2019. RESULTS: Declining trends in incidence and prevalence rates of acute HBV (aHBV) and chronic HBV were observed in SWE and WE, with the pace of decline being slower in the post-austerity period (2010-2019) and mortality due to HBV stabilised in SWE. Acute HCV (aHCV) metrics and chronic HCV incidence and mortality showed a stable trend in SWE and WE, whereas the prevalence of chronic HCV showed an oscillating trend, decreasing in WE in 2010-2019 (p < 0.001). Liver cancer due to both hepatitis infections showed a stagnant burden over time. An inverse association was observed between health expenditure and metrics of both acute and chronic HBV and HCV. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological metrics for HBV and HCV showed a slower pace of decline in the post-austerity period with better improvement for HBV, a stabilisation of mortality and a stagnant burden for liver cancer due to both hepatitis infections. The economic crisis of 2008 had a negative impact on the burden of hepatitis B and C.

35457514,"Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice towards Hepatitis B Infection Prevention and Screening among Indonesians.","Hepatitis B has been one of the most prevalent infectious diseases in the world and specifically in Indonesia. Although the total conversion of hepatitis B virus (HBV) to chronic disease in Indonesia was reduced by 50%, the total number of hepatitis B cases increased by 2.5 times in 2021. Ineffective HBV immunization program in Indonesia prior to 1997 was addressed by the Ministry of Health through a more comprehensive HBV control, which, among others, involved Health Promotion to increase people's knowledge and awareness towards hepatitis B infection prevention. In this regard, this study aims to identify the level of knowledge, attitude, and practice/behavior of the Indonesian population towards hepatitis B infection prevention and their willingness for screening, particularly in areas with high prevalence of hepatitis B. This study used a quantitative approach in looking at correlations between this set of knowledge, attitude, and practice, mainly by using Structural Equation Model (SEM) and SmartPLS 3.3.3 toolkit in SPSS. Through an analysis of online questionnaire results from over 400 respondents in four provinces (DKI Jakarta, West Java, DI Yogyakarta, and South Sulawesi), this study shows that respondents have a very high level of knowledge about hepatitis B; high level of positive attitude; and very high level of positive practice towards hepatitis B infection prevention. However, we also noticed some dissonances between the key aspects, namely that knowledge on hepatitis B correlates negatively with the behavior of the respondents and that the behavior also correlates negatively with their willingness for screening. In conclusion, we suggest that factors such as socio-economic context and prior informed knowledge on hepatitis B be considered to build a better strategy of Health Promotion and hepatitis B diagnostic screening among the population.","Dwiartama A, Nirbayati WF, Giri-Rachman EA, Niloperbowo W, Tan MI, Anin A",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2022 Apr 12,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
37887736,"Prevalence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Hepatitis B Population within Southeast Asia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of 39,050 Participants.","BACKGROUND AND AIM: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a significant complication of hepatitis B and still poses a global public health concern. This systematic review and meta-analysis provide adequate details on the prevalence of HCC in the HBV population within Southeast Asian countries. METHOD: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) criteria, a thorough search for literature discussing the prevalence of HCC in the HBV population within southeast Asia was performed. Eligible studies were subjected to a meta-analysis utilising a DerSimonian and Laird approach and a random effect model. A protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023423953). RESULT: Our study meticulously recovered 41 articles from seven countries in Southeast Asia, namely Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. A total of 39,050 HBV patients and 7479 HCC cases in southeast Asia were analysed. The pooled prevalence of HCC in HBV cases within southeast Asia was 45.8% (95% CI, 34.3-57.8%, I(2) = 99.51%, p < 0.001). Singapore (62.5%, CI: 42.4-79.1) had the highest pooled prevalence of HCC in the HBV population compared to Vietnam, with the lowest estimate (22.4%, CI: 9.9-44.9). There was a drop in the pooled prevalence of HCC in HBV from 2016 until now (37.6%, CI: 19.2-60.5).

2988352,"Serologic markers of hepatitis A and B in the population of Bali, Indonesia.","A total of 343 sera from Balinese subjects in different age groups and geographic locations were tested by radioimmunoassay (RIA) for serum antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) and hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc); most sera were also tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and for antibody to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV). One hundred percent of the adult population was found to have anti-HAV, with antibody acquisition beginning in early childhood and reaching a level of 95% by the age of 10 years. Antibodies to hepatitis B virus were also frequent in young children, rapidly peaking to near 80% in older children and adolescents, then declining to a plateau that fluctuated between 40% and 60% throughout adult life. Overall, anti-HBc (49%) was detected slightly more often than anti-HBs (45%), but the relative frequencies of the 2 antibodies varied considerably from group to group. Despite these high antibody prevalences, HBsAg was detected in only 1.5% of the general population, and in no woman of child-bearing age. In utero infection is thus far less likely to account for the early acquisition of antibody to hepatitis B virus than inapparent percutaneous transmission occurring under conditions of close personal contact.","Brown P, Breguet G, Smallwood L, Ney R, Moerdowo RM, Gerety RJ",Am J Trop Med Hyg,1985 May,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia

30630464,Knowledge and awareness of hepatitis B among households in Malaysia: a community-based cross-sectional survey.,"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B (HepB) is a major public health concern in Malaysia yet little is known about knowledge and awareness of this infection in the country. Such information is essential for designing effective intervention strategies for HepB prevention and control. The aim of this study was to characterize knowledge and awareness regarding HepB in Malaysia and to identify their associated sociodemographic determinants. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted between January and May 2016 in Selangor state of Malaysia. A two-stage cluster random sampling design was used and one adult member of selected households was interviewed face-to-face. Logistic regression was used to estimate the differences in knowledge and awareness between groups. RESULTS: A total of 764 households completed the interviews and were included in the final analysis. Only 36.9 and 38.8% of the participants had good knowledge and awareness, respectively. The factors associated with good knowledge were being in the 35-44 year age group, Malay ethnicity, high educational attainment and high family income. Being Chinese, being older and having high educational attainment were determinants of having good awareness towards HepB. Participants who had good knowledge were 2.5 times more likely to also have good awareness (OR: 2.41, 95% CI: 1.78-3.26, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals a low level of knowledge and awareness of HepB among households in Malaysia. This finding highlights the need to improve public knowledge and awareness through well-designed programs targeting vulnerable groups in order to reduce hepatitis B virus transmission and achieve the governmental target of eliminating viral hepatitis as a public health concern by 2030.","Rajamoorthy Y, Taib NM, Munusamy S, Anwar S, Wagner AL, Mudatsir M, Muller R, Kuch U, Groneberg DA, Harapan H, Khin AA",BMC Public Health,2019 Jan 10,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia

There has been limited data regarding HBV infection in young adult population. This study aimed to evaluate the seroepidemiology of HBV infection and characterize occult HBV variants in healthy young adults in Banjarmasin, Indonesia, who were born before the implementation of the universal infant hepatitis B vaccination. Serum samples of 195 healthy young adults were tested for HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs. The prevalence of HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs was 9 (4.6%), 62 (31.8%), and 96 (49.2%), respectively. Seventy four (37.9%) samples were seronegative for all three parameters, indicating the susceptibility to HBV infection. Among 66 samples positive for HBsAg and/or anti-HBc, 13 (19.7%) were HBV DNA positive; of these, four were HBsAg positive and nine were HBsAg negative, and categorized as occult HBV infection. Most occult HBV cases had high-level anti-HBs (>100 IU/l), suggesting that blood with positive anti-HBs and anti-HBc could not be regarded as noninfectious. Thirteen amino acid substitutions were identified: T126S, P127S, Q129R, T131N, M133T, and Y161S in the HBsAg-positive group; P120T, T126I, G145S, Y161F, E164V, and V168F in the occult-HBV group; and T143S in both groups. More studies are required to provide data on the prevalence and characteristics of mutants to ensure reliable diagnosis. The occult HBV infection, combined with the HBsAg prevalence, could indicate the high HBV carriage among young adults in this area. The high percentage of individuals susceptible to HBV infection reiterates the need for catch-up immunization strategies targeted at young adults.","Darmawan E, Turyadi, El-Khobar KE, Nursanty NK, Thedja MD, Muljono DH",J Med Virol,2015 Feb,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
32896077,Meta-analysis: Association between hepatitis B virus preS mutation and hepatocellular carcinoma risk.,"Previous observational studies suggested that hepatitis B virus (HBV) preS mutation plays an important role in the existence of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the results are still debatable. With an increasing number of studies about this topic, this study employed a meta-analysis to identify the association between HBV preS mutation and HCC risk. We searched for eligible studies from PubMed, ProQuest, CINAHL, ScienceDirect and Springer databases to assess the association between HBV mutation and HCC risk. This meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.3 to provide pooled estimate for odds ratio (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Twenty-one clinical studies were included in this meta-analysis study which consisted of 1738 participants with HBV-related HCC and 3740 HBsAg-positive patients without HCC. All studies used samples of Asian population. PreS deletion was the most common mutation found in all studies. We found that ORs of HBV overall preS deletion was associated with HCC (OR = 3.28; 95% CI = 2.32-4.65; P < .00001; random-effects model). Each preS1 and preS2 deletion was associated with increased risk of HCC, with OR 2.42 (95% CI = 1.25-4.68, P = .008) and 3.36 (95% CI = 2.04-5.55, P < .00001), respectively. PreS2 start codon mutation was also significantly associated with HCC risk (OR = 2.47; 95% CI: 1.15-5.27; P = .02; random-effect model). The result of this meta-analysis suggested that HBV preS deletion (all, preS1 and preS2) and preS2 start codon mutation might contribute to the increased risk of HBV-related HCC.","Wungu CDK, Ariyanto FC, Prabowo GI, Soetjipto S, Handajani R",J Viral Hepat,2021 Jan,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia

Before its implementation, the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive individuals in the general population was approximately 5-10%. The study aimed to investigate the hepatitis B virus (HBV) serological status and molecular profile among children, 15 years after adoption of a universal infant vaccination program in Indonesia. According to the Local Health Office data in five areas, the percentages of children receiving three doses of hepatitis B vaccine are high (73.9-94.1%), whereas the birth dose coverage is less than 50%. Among 967 children in those areas, the seropositive rate of HBsAg in preschool- and school-aged children ranged from 2.1% to 4.2% and 0% to 5.9%, respectively. Of the 61 HBV DNA-positive samples, the predominant genotype/subtype was B/adw2 Subtype adw3 was identified in genotype C for the first time in this population. Six samples (11.5%) had an amino acid substitution within the a determinant of the S gene region, and one sample had T140I that was suggested as a vaccine-escape mutant type. The low birth dose coverage and the presence of a vaccine-escape mutant might contribute to the endemicity of HBV infection among children in Indonesia.","Purwono PB, Juniastuti, Amin M, Bramanthi R, Nursidah, Resi EM, Wahyuni RM, Yano Y, Soetjipto, Hotta H, Hayashi Y, Utsumi T, Lusida MI",Am J Trop Med Hyg,2016 Sep 7,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
25559671,"Full genome characterization and phylogenetic analysis of hepatitis B virus in gibbons and a caretaker in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia.","Hepatitis B virus (HBV) from gibbons was characterized, and the possibility of horizontal transmission between gibbons and humans was examined in a gibbon rehabilitation center in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Ten gibbons that were positive for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) on arrival and 13 caretakers for those gibbons were included in this study. The duration of stay at the rehabilitation center ranged from 1 to 10 years. Serological and molecular analyses were performed. Six gibbons were positive for HBsAg, whereas HBV DNA was detected in all ten of the gibbons sampled. On the other hand, HBsAg was detected in only 1 of the 13 caretakers. HBV samples from seven gibbons and from the one infected human were chosen for complete genome sequencing. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that the cluster of gibbon strains in this study was distinct from strains previously reported from other countries. In the pre-S1 region, we found a unique amino acid residue substitution (P89K), three insertions between T87 and L88 in the genomes of three gibbons, and a 33-nucleotide deletion at the start of pre-S1 that is common in non-human primates. The caretaker sample was identified as HBV subgenotype B3, the most common type in Indonesia. For the complete HBV sequences, the similarity between gibbons in this study and other non-human primate and human HBV isolates was 90-91.9 % and 85.5-89.6 %, respectively.

23585411,Reactivation of hepatitis B virus associated with chemotherapy and immunosuppressive agent.,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation after chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy is a serious cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality. The mechanism of HBV reactivation is still unclear, but it is believed due to the suppression of immune response hence increasing the viral load. No uniform diagnostic criteria are available, HBV reactivation can be confirmed by an increase in serum HBV-DNA level. There are many consensus regarding this issue, including the type and duration of nucleoside analogue therapy which need to be understood as not all chronic hepatitis B patients will lead to HBV reactivation. Recently, there has been an increased awareness of reactivation of occult hepatitis B virus, especially in hepatitis B virus endemic area, including Indonesia as part of Asia Pacific region. Preempative antiviral therapy was the best approach to prevent the HBV reactivation.","Wijaya I, Hasan I",Acta Med Indones,2013 Jan,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
38660644,Hepatitis B virus genotypes in precision medicine of hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma: Where we are now.,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major player in chronic hepatitis B that may lead to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBV genetics are diverse where it is classified into at least 9 genotypes (A to I) and 1 putative genotype (J), each with specific geographical distribution and possible different clinical outcomes in the patient. This diversity may be associated with the precision medicine for HBV-related HCC and the success of therapeutical approaches against HCC, related to different pathogenicity of the virus and host response. This Editorial discusses recent updates on whether the classification of HBV genetic diversity is still valid in terms of viral oncogenicity to the HCC and its precision medicine, in addition to the recent advances in cellular and molecular biology technologies.","Sukowati CHC, Jayanti S, Turyadi T, Muljono DH, Tiribelli C",World J Gastrointest Oncol,2024 Apr 15,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
38455604,"Evaluating the impact of triple elimination program for mother-to-child transmission of HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B in Indonesia.","Indonesian government launched a triple elimination program to eliminate mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), syphilis, and hepatitis B in 2018, aiming to increase screening uptake among pregnant women during antenatal visits and to reduce the rates of these infections in children less than 50 per 100,000 live births. Despite this initiative, a thorough assessment of its effectiveness, particularly in Bandung, the capital city of West Java, as one of the most densely populated cities in Indonesia with a high HIV incidence, has yet to be conducted. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of this triple elimination program in Bandung by assessing the data between 2017 and 2020. Monthly data was obtained from the Health Office of Bandung for four years, including number of screenings done for HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B, number of confirmed cases and number of pregnant women treated for those infections. Additionally, data on children under 24 months old afflicted by these infections were also collected. Our data indicated an increase in screening coverage for HIV, syphilis, and HBV among pregnant women; however, it remained below the national set benchmarks for screening coverage. Only 59.5% of HIV-positive pregnant women received anti-retroviral therapy in 2020, while merely 25% of syphilis-positive cases were administered benzathine penicillin G. Syphilis screening was correlated with an increase in positive cases among children, suggesting missed opportunities in managing syphilis-positive pregnant women. Furthermore, management of HIV- and syphilis-positive cases had suboptimal outcomes. Data on hepatitis B was not evaluated since it was not available. To achieve the triple elimination program goals, comprehensive coordination among all relevant stakeholders is required, as is continuous monitoring and evaluation.","Azhali BA, Setiabudi D, Alam A",Narra J,2023 Dec,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
37915151,A Very Young Adult Female Patient with Hepatitis B Flare: A Case Report.,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major global health problem. It can cause chronic infection and put people at high risk of death from cirrhosis and liver cancer. This study aims to present a case of chronic hepatitis B flare in a very young adult patient. An 18-year-old previously healthy female presented with jaundice developing in one week, following the previous complaints of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, and tiredness for about three months. The patient had no risk factors for getting HBV infection, but her HBsAg-positive mother was probably an inactive HBV carrier. The hepatitis B serological testing revealed HBsAg positivity, anti-HBs seronegativity, HBeAg positivity, anti-HBe seronegativity, anti-HBc IgM seronegativity, and high levels of HBV DNA detected > 1.70 x 108 IU/mL. There was a sharp increase in serum ALT to >/= 5-fold ULN. The abdominal ultrasonography revealed a hepatitis feature, unremarkable portal venous flow, and an extrahepatic biliary system. The liver transient elastography revealed 15.6 kPa of liver stiffness, which was in accordance with the F3-F4 fibrosis stage. These features were typical of a hepatitis B flare, the HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B, previously known as the immune reactive phase.

24498341,"Prevalence and risk factors of hepatitis B virus infection in Bahrain, 2000 through 2010.","Hepatitis B infection is one of the world's major infectious diseases with about 350 million chronic carriers. Because no data is published on the prevalence and risk factors of this important disease in Bahrain, this article evaluates the available data from 2000 to 2010 to estimate the prevalence of the infection and to evaluate the risk factors. Epidemiologic data on HBV cases were collected from the major hospitals and health centers in Bahrain and statistically analyzed. Over this indicated decade, 877,892 individuals were screened for HBV infection and 5055 positive cases were reported in Bahrain. The prevalence of HBV infection during that period was 0.58%. Although there was no significant difference in the prevalence over the period of 10 years, the actual number of positive cases has almost doubled in the later years especially in 2007 and 2008. The prevalence was significantly higher among males (62.3%; P<0.01). Most cases were associated with non Bahrainis and the prevalence was significantly higher among them (68.3%; P<0.01) than it was among Bahrainis (31.7%). Seventy eight percent (2877/3690) of non Bahraini cases were for citizens of six countries which are highly endemic for HBV, namely India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Philippines, Indonesia and Ethiopia. Dental procedures and surgical operations were the main risk factors of infection as 37.2% and 35.6% of the patients were probably infected through this route. The prevalence of hepatitis B virus infection in Bahrain indicates that Bahrain had low HBV endemicity for the last 10 years (2000-2010). Our study verifies the significant role played by expatriates/immigrants in the present epidemiology of hepatitis B in Bahrain. Increasing HBV vaccination of high risk groups, active educational and media campaign, screening HBV infection during pregnancy, and surveillance of hepatitis B infected individuals will further decrease the prevalence of the disease in Bahrain.",Janahi EM,PLoS One,2014,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
19705499,Hepatitis B virus subgenotypes and basal core promoter mutations in Indonesia.,"AIM: To identify the distribution of hepatitis B virus (HBV) subgenotype and basal core promoter (BCP) mutations among patients with HBV-associated liver disease in Indonesia. METHODS: Patients with chronic hepatitis (CH, n = 61), liver cirrhosis (LC, n = 62), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, n = 48) were included in this study. HBV subgenotype was identified based on S or preS gene sequence, and mutations in the HBx gene including the overlapping BCP region were examined by direct sequencing. RESULTS: HBV genotype B (subgenotypes B2, B3, B4, B5 and B7) the major genotype in the samples, accounted for 75.4%, 71.0% and 75.0% of CH, LC and HCC patients, respectively, while the genotype C (subgenotypes C1, C2 and C3) was detected in 24.6%, 29.0%, and 25.0% of CH, LC, and HCC patients, respectively. Subgenotypes B3 (84.9%) and C1 (82.2%) were the main subgenotype in HBV genotype B and C, respectively. Serotype adw2 (84.9%) and adrq+ (89.4%) were the most prevalent in HBV genotype B and C, respectively. Double mutation (A1762T/G1764A) in the BCP was significantly higher in LC (59.7%) and HCC (54.2%) than in CH (19.7%), suggesting that this mutation was associated with severity of liver disease. The T1753V was also higher in LC (46.8%), but lower in HCC (22.9%) and CH (18.0%), suggesting that this mutation may be an indicator of cirrhosis. CONCLUSION: HBV genotype B/B3 and C/C1 are the major genotypes in Indonesia. Mutations in BCP, such as A1762T/G1764A and T1753V, might have an association with manifestations of liver disease.","Utama A, Purwantomo S, Siburian MD, Dhenni R, Gani RA, Hasan I, Sanityoso A, Miskad UA, Akil F, Yusuf I, Achwan WA, Soemohardjo S, Lelosutan SA, Martamala R, Lukito B, Budihusodo U, Lesmana LA, Sulaiman A, Tai S",World J Gastroenterol,2009 Aug 28,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
37614017,"Assessing the Impact of Hepatitis B Elimination Program on Maternal-Infant Health in West Java, Indonesia: A Cross-Sectional Study.","BACKGROUND Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection during pregnancy is a significant concern due to the risk of vertical transmission to the newborn, posing serious health complications. Understanding the effectiveness of intervention programs is paramount, especially in regions where comprehensive research is sparse. This study delves into the efficacy of the HBV elimination program in Garut Regency, West Java, Indonesia, targeting pregnant women and their newborns. MATERIAL AND METHODS This cross-sectional research encompassed 100 HBsAg-positive pregnant women who delivered at a singular facility in Garut Regency and their 62 offspring. Clinical data collection was rigorous, and HBsAg status was determined using rapid test kits, employing the precision of the 2-sided sandwich assay immunochromatography method. Data interpretation was multifaceted, involving univariate, bivariate, and multiple regression logistic analyses. RESULTS Notably, 16.95% of women, previously diagnosed as HBsAg-negative by initial health assessments, were subsequently diagnosed as positive at the specialized referral hospital. A noteworthy finding was that children administered with the HBV vaccine manifested a significantly diminished Positive-HBsAg status (P=0.029). Intriguingly, a majority of the maternal variables displayed a direct correlation with the HBsAg status of their offspring. The protective role of the HBV vaccine against HBV infection stood out distinctly (OR=0.326; CI 0.019-5.554; P=0.029). CONCLUSIONS While our center successfully met the desired HBsAg testing coverage in pregnant women, the administration of the hepatitis B vaccine to infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers lags behind the intended target. Emphasizing the vaccination's vital role, our study underscores its significance as a frontline defense for such infants.","Anwar AD, Nugrahani AD, Santoso DPJ, Aziz MA, Ulfah L, Surachman A",Med Sci Monit,2023 Aug 24,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia

39713069,Exploring the impact of hepatitis B immunoglobulin and antiviral interventions to reduce vertical transmission of hepatitis B virus.,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major public health burden. In HBV endemic regions, high prevalence is also correlated with the infections acquired in infancy through perinatal transmission or early childhood exposure to HBV, the so-called mother-to-child transmission (MTCT). Children who are infected with HBV at a young age are at higher risk of developing chronic HBV infection than those infected as adults, which may lead to worse clinical outcome. To reduce the incidence of HBV MTCT, several interventions for the infants or the mothers, or both, are already carried out. This review explores the newest information and approaches available in literature regarding HBV MTCT prevalence and its challenges, especially in high HBV endemic countries. This covers HBV screening in pregnant women, prenatal intervention, infant immunoprophylaxis, and post-vaccination serological testing for children.","Wibowo DP, Agustiningsih A, Jayanti S, Sukowati CHC, El Khobar KE",World J Exp Med,2024 Dec 20,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
37214093,"The effectiveness of hepatitis B vaccine in toddlers based on the five-year period national basic health research (Riskesdas 2007, 2013 and 2018) in Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B is a viral infection that has a high prevalence in Indonesia. The Ministry of Health of Indonesia has conducted a national vaccination program for hepatitis B. In order to evaluate the success of the hepatitis B vaccination in Indonesia, a community study based on basic health research (Riskesdas) was performed nationwide since 2007 for five year period in 2007, 2013, and 2018. METHODS: Further statistical analysis was performed specifically for the children under 59 months old (toddlers) immunized in both urban and rural areas in 2007, 2013, and 2018 based on certain characteristics by examining antibodies against HBsAg (anti-HBs), IgG antibodies against the core antigen (HBcAb), surface antigen (HBsAg) of hepatitis B virus (HBV). The data obtained from the data management laboratory of Ministry of Health, Indonesia, was analyzed with Bivariate analysis with continuity correction chi-square or Pearson chi-square using Stata software version 16. RESULTS: This study showed an increase in hepatitis B coverage of complete immunization (30% in 2007, 60.3% in 2013, and 57% in 2018), which was also influenced by mothers' level of education (Pearson chi-square , p  inverted exclamation mark 0.05) and access to health service points within 30 minutes (OR = 1.3-2.8, p  inverted exclamation mark 0.05). The trend of the percentage of immune status (anti-HBs) was increased (41.8% in 2007; 56.1% in 2013; and 79.1% in 2018). The higher anti-HBs was found in complete hepatitis B immunization status (OR = 1.5-2, p  inverted exclamation mark 0.05) and in good nutritional status (p  inverted exclamation mark 0.05). However, the anti-HBs was found decreased with increasing age (p  inverted exclamation mark 0.05). The trend of positive HBcAb (exposure to HBV infection) showed a decrease gradually of almost ten times from 2007 (8.6%-13.5%) compared to 2013 (2.6%-11.1%) and 2018 (1.1%-2%). Urban areas were at higher risk of hepatitis B exposure (OR = 1.4-2.2) than rural areas (OR = 0.37-0.80). The HBsAg data were only available in 2013 and 2018. Riskesdas data analysis showed the prevalence of hepatitis B (HBsAg) was lower in complete immunization status than that in incomplete one (p  inverted exclamation mark 0.05), but with an increase from 3.9% (2013) to 9.3% (2018), possibly due to inappropriate implementation of birth dose immunization or a vaccine-escape mutant from the HBV variants. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of hepatitis B vaccine obtained from the three Riskesdas periods in Indonesia showed an improvement, with an increase in immune status, reduced exposure to HBV and a lower prevalence of hepatitis B in children with complete vaccination. However, there is still an increase in hepatitis B infection, especially in urban areas. Therefore, a long-term evaluation of immunization coverage especially ensuring that the initial dose of immunization was given within the first 24 h of birth, HBsAg and HBcAb, nutritional status, genomic surveillance of HBV, and other aspects of program quality evaluation are needed to ensure that elimination efforts have been implemented properly.","Lestari CSW, Dewi RM, Sunarno S, Hasugian AR, Handayani S, Maha MS, Panjaitan NSD, Ningrum N, Sari M, Fairuza F",PeerJ,2023,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
37357696,Molecular epidemiology of hepatitis B among Indigenous Australians in Queensland and the Torres Strait Islands.,"BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major health problem for all Indigenous Australians. Post-2000, Hepatitis B surface antigen prevalence has decreased, although remaining four times higher among Indigenous compared with non-Indigenous people. AIMS: This study aimed to characterise the HBV from Indigenous populations in Queensland and the Torres Strait Islands. METHODS: Serum samples were collected, with consent, from people within Queensland Indigenous communities prior to 1990 as part of the Queensland Health vaccination programme. Ethics approval was subsequently obtained to further characterise the HBV from 93 of these stored samples. HBV DNA was extracted and genotype was obtained from 82 samples. HBV full genome sequencing was carried out for a subset of 14 samples. RESULTS: Seventy-eight samples were identified as genotype C (2 x C12, 3 x C13 and 73 x C14), one sample as genotype A (A2) and three samples as genotype D (1 x D2, 1 x D3 and 1 x D4). The HBV/C sequences identified were most closely related to sequences isolated from Papua New Guinea and Indonesia (Papua Province). CONCLUSIONS: The HBV isolated from the Torres Strait Islanders was notably different to the HBV/C4 strain isolated from Indigenous people of mainland northern Australia, with no evidence of recombination. This reflects the differences in culture and origin between Torres Strait Islanders and mainland Indigenous people.","Littlejohn M, Jaskowski LA, Edwards R, Jackson K, Yuen L, Crawford D, Locarnini SA, Cooksley G",Intern Med J,2024 Jan,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
2894501,"Waterborne non-A, non-B hepatitis.","Waterborne non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANB) is responsible for outbreaks of hepatitis with a predilection for young adults. The disease is usually mild, except in pregnant women, who have a high case-fatality rate from fulminant hepatic failure. Diagnosis is largely based on the epidemiological findings of faecal contamination of drinking water and serological exclusion of hepatitis A and B virus infection. Histological features of liver biopsy specimens are characteristic and virus-like particles in the stool are aggregated by antibody present in acute and convalescent phase sera of the test subject. NANB is widespread in India and several countries of South-East Asia; it is increasingly recognised in Africa and may occur in Latin America. Control measures include provision of clean water supplies, safe disposal of human excreta, and sound personal and food hygiene practices. Passive immunisation with immunoglobulin derived from healthy donors resident in the countries affected by the disease may protect vulnerable groups.","Ramalingaswami V, Purcell RH",Lancet,1988 Mar 12,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
30521602,The relationship between perceptions and self-paid hepatitis B vaccination: A structural equation modeling approach.,"BACKGROUND: Malaysia has a comprehensive, publicly-funded immunization program for hepatitis B (HepB) among infants, but adults must pay for the vaccine. The number of HepB carriers among adults is expected to increase in the future; therefore, we examined the impact of five constructs (cues to action, perceived barriers, perceived benefit, perceived severity, and perceived susceptibility) on adults' willingness to pay (WTP) for HepB vaccine; secondarily, we examined the association between perceived barriers and perceived benefits. METHODS: Adults were selected through a stratified, two-stage cluster community sample in Selangor, Malaysia. The reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity of the measurement model were assessed before implementing a partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM) to evaluate the significance of the structural paths. RESULTS: A total of 728 participants were enrolled. The five constructs all showed adequate internal reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. There was a significant, positive relationship to WTP from constructs (perceived barriers [Path coefficient (beta) = 0.082, P = 0.036], perceived susceptibility [beta = 0.214, P<0.001], and cues to action [beta = 0.166, P<0.001]), and the model all together accounted for 8.8% of the variation in WTP. There was a significant, negative relationship between perceived barriers and perceived benefit [beta = -0.261, P<0.001], which accounted for 6.8% of variation in perceived benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Policy and programs should be targeted that can modify individuals' thoughts about disease risk, their obstacles in obtaining the preventive action, and their readiness to obtain a vaccine. Such programs include educational materials about disease risk and clinic visits that can pair HepB screening and vaccination.","Rajamoorthy Y, Radam A, Taib NM, Rahim KA, Wagner AL, Mudatsir M, Munusamy S, Harapan H",PLoS One,2018,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
22499006,Clinical and virological characteristics of hepatitis B or C virus co-infection with HIV in Indonesian patients.,"Hepatitis virus-related liver disease increases substantially the mortality rate of patients with HIV on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Therefore, early diagnosis of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) is important. However, the prevalence of HBV and HCV infection in Indonesian patients infected with HIV is unknown. Therefore, this study examined the molecular and clinical characteristics of HBV and HCV in 126 patients infected with HIV, mostly on HAART, at Dr. Sardjito Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The rates of triple infection, HIV/HCV co-infection, HIV/HBV co-infection, and mono-infection were 4.8%, 34.1%, 3.2%, and 57.9%, respectively. Seven HCV genotypes were detected, with genotypes 1a, 1b, 1c, 3a, 3k, 4a, and 6n found in 23 (52%), 1 (2%), 4 (9%), 5 (11%), 7 (16%), 3 (6%), and 1 (2%) patients, respectively, indicating multiple modes of transmission. HBV-DNA was detected in 2/10 patients with hepatitis B surface antigen; both patients were HAART naive. Univariate analysis revealed that male sex, higher education level, injection drug use, sexual contact, alanine aminotransferase >/=40 IU/L, and aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index > 0.5 were associated with HCV co-infection. In multivariate analysis, injection drug use (OR: 26.52; 95% CI: 3.52-199.54) and alanine aminotransferase >/=40 IU/L (OR: 6.36; 95% CI: 1.23-32.89) were independently associated with HCV co-infection. HCV co-infection was common among Indonesian patients infected with HIV, particularly among injecting drug users, and was a risk factor for disease progression of HIV.","Anggorowati N, Yano Y, Heriyanto DS, Rinonce HT, Utsumi T, Mulya DP, Subronto YW, Hayashi Y",J Med Virol,2012 Jun,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia

21318309,"Ethnogeographical structure of hepatitis B virus genotype distribution in Indonesia and discovery of a new subgenotype, B9.","The distribution of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the populations of island Southeast Asia is of medical and anthropological interest and is associated with an unusually high genetic diversity. This study examined the association of this HBV genetic diversity with the ethnogeography of the populations of the Indonesian archipelago. Whole genome analysis of 21 HBV isolates from East Nusa Tenggara and Papua revealed two recently reported HBV/B subgenotypes unique to the former, B7 (7 isolates) and B8 (5 isolates), and uncovered a further novel subgenotype designated B9 (4 isolates). Further isolates were collected from 419 individuals with defined ethnic backgrounds representing 40 populations. HBV/B was predominant in Austronesian-language-speaking populations, whereas HBV/C was the major genotype in Papua and Papua-influenced populations of Moluccas; HBV/B3 was the predominant subgenotype in the western half of the archipelago (speakers of the Western Malayo-Polynesian [WMP] branch of Austronesian languages), whereas B7, B8 and B9 were specific to Nusa Tenggara (Central Malayo-Polynesian (CMP)). The result provides the first direct evidence that the distribution of HBV genotypes/subgenotypes in the Indonesian archipelago is related to the ethnic origin of its populations and suggests that the HBV distribution is associated with the ancient migratory events in the peopling of the archipelago.","Thedja MD, Muljono DH, Nurainy N, Sukowati CH, Verhoef J, Marzuki S",Arch Virol,2011 May,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia

In this study, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) subtyping and HBV genotyping were carried out on sera obtained from HBsAg-positive HBV carriers, including healthy blood donors; patients with acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma; and patients on hemodialysis all located in Surabaya, Indonesia. We report here that all HBV isolates tested in Surabaya belonged to genotype B, with more than 90% of them being classified into subtype adw. Our results also revealed that prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection among HBV carriers in Surabaya was approximately 10% for healthy blood donors and patients with chronic liver disease, and approximately 60% for patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Interestingly, HBsAg titers were lower in HBV carriers with HCV co-infection than in those without HCV co-infection. We also found that prevalence of hepatitis D virus (HDV) co-infection was < 0.5% among HBV carriers in Surabaya.","Lusida MI, Surayah, Sakugawa H, Nagano-Fujii M, Soetjipto, Mulyanto, Handajani R, Boediwarsono, Setiawan PB, Nidom CA, Ohgimoto S, Hotta H",Microbiol Immunol,2003,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
36406974,Baseline serum Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer as a predictor of hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic hepatitis B patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: A minimally invasive tool to promptly predict hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is currently needed. In this study, we aimed via a meta-analysis to identify the serum Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) as a novel glycoprotein-based liver fibrosis marker for predicting HCC in CHB patients. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search on PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, Wiley Online Library, and CINAHL Plus (via EBSCOhost). The articles were screened based on several eligibility criteria and were further assessed for study qualities using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The outcomes were presented as standard mean difference (SMD), hazard ratio (HR), and predictive accuracy parameters of a baseline cutoff index (COI) for serum M2BPGi. RESULTS: Fourteen studies involving 5918 CHB patients were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Baseline COI serum M2BPGi was significantly higher in CHB patients who developed HCC than in those who did not (SMD 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.91-1.72). A significant HCC risk prediction was also observed (multivariate HR 1.18, 95%CI 1.05-1.32). Baseline COI serum M2BPGi could predict HCC with a pooled sensitivity of 74% (95%CI 50-89%), specificity of 80% (95%CI 65-90%), and area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.84 (95%CI 0.81-0.87). CONCLUSION: High baseline COI serum M2BPGi may predict the development of HCC in CHB patients with moderate-to-high accuracy.","Witarto AP, Witarto BS, Pramudito SL, Putra AJE, Nurhadi GM, Maimunah U",Ann Gastroenterol,2022 Nov-Dec,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
38021059,Correlation Between Vitamin D Status and HBsAg Antibody Levels in Indonesian Adolescents Immunised Against Hepatitis B.,"INTRODUCTION: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global health problem. Anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) levels increase along with vitamin D levels in adults. However, few studies have examined this relationship in adolescents. Few studies have examined the relationship between vitamin D and HBsAg antibody levels, especially in Indonesia. METHODS: This cross-sectional study examined vitamin D and anti-HBsAg levels before and after hepatitis B immunisation. All subjects blood was taken to check for vitamin D level. This study was part of the Safety and Preliminary of Immunogenicity Following Recombinant Hepatitis B (Bio Farma) Vaccine in Adults and Children Phase I trial. RESULTS: This study found that 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] status was primarily deficient based on endocrine criteria. The children's hepatitis B antibody response was mostly <10 mIU/mL before and >/=10 mIU/mL after vaccination. There was a relationship between sex and 25(OH)D status, with median 25(OH)D levels higher in females (18.2 ng/mL) than in males (9.8 ng/mL). However, the relationship between vitamin 25(OH)D status and anti-HBsAg levels pre- and post-vaccination was not significant. DISCUSSION: However, some research found that vitamin D supplementation after immunisation did not impact vaccine response, several studies have reported that vitamin D can decrease HBV replication through various mechanisms, including reducing viral transcription and interfering with viral protein synthesis. CONCLUSION: There was no relationship between 25(OH)D status and anti-HBsAg levels. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and establish optimal treatment strategies.","Girsang RT, Rusmil K, Fadlyana E, Kartasasmita CB, Dwi Putra MG, Setiabudiawan B",Int J Gen Med,2023,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
16953033,Hepatocarcinogenesis in viral Hepatitis B infection: the role of HBx and p53.,"Infection of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) is a risk factor of chronic active hepatitis (CAH), hepatic cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Infection of HBV may develop to HCC without antecedent hepatic cirrhosis. Pathogenesis of HBV causing malignant changes has not been fully understood. HBx, a protein of HBV, is an activator of transcription process involved in hepatocarcinogenesis. Most of human cancer associated with mutation of p53, a Tumor Suppressor Genes, a protein serves as cellular protection for growth and cell division, which is one of predisposition factor of hepatocarcinoma. Some studies indicate the correlation between mutation / inactivation of p53 and HBV protein x (HBx) in hepatocarcinogenesis. In that process, HBx will suppress p53 function, which will lead to ineffective liver cell division and resulting in HCC.","Dewantoro O, Gani RA, Akbar N",Acta Med Indones,2006 Jul-Sep,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
30964934,"Willingness to pay for hepatitis B vaccination in Selangor, Malaysia: A cross-sectional household survey.","BACKGROUND: In Malaysia, one million individuals are estimated to be infected with the hepatitis B virus. A vaccine for infants has been compulsory since 1989, whereas those born before 1989 need to spend their own money to be vaccinated in private clinics or hospitals. The aim of this study was to investigate and ascertain the determinants of willingness to pay (WTP) for adult hepatitis B vaccine in Selangor, Malaysia. METHODS: In 2016, 728 households were selected through a stratified, two stage cluster sample and interviewed. Willingness to pay for hepatitis B vaccine was estimated using the Contingent Valuation Method, and factors affecting WTP were modelled with logit regression. RESULTS: We found that 273 (37.5%) of the households were willing to pay for hepatitis B vaccination. The mean and median of WTP was estimated at Ringgit Malaysia (RM)303 (approximately US$73) for the three dose series. The estimated WTP was significantly greater in those with higher levels of education, among Malays and Chinese (compared to others, predominantly Indians), and for those with greater perceived susceptibility to hepatitis B virus infection. Other factors-perceived severity, barriers, benefits and cues to action-were not significantly associated with WTP for adult hepatitis B vaccination. CONCLUSION: Additional resources are needed to cover the households that are not willing to pay for hepatitis B vaccination. More awareness (particularly in regards to hepatitis B virus susceptibility) could change the national perception towards self-paid hepatitis B virus vaccination and increase hepatitis B vaccine coverage.","Rajamoorthy Y, Radam A, Taib NM, Rahim KA, Munusamy S, Wagner AL, Mudatsir M, Bazrbachi A, Harapan H",PLoS One,2019,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
25037178,Epidemiology of HBV subgenotypes D.,"The natural history of hepatitis B virus infection is not uniform and affected from several factors including, HBV genotype. Genotype D is a widely distributed genotype. Among genotype D, several subgenotypes differentiate epidemiologically and probably clinically. D1 is predominant in Middle East and North Africa, and characterized by early HBeAg seroconversion and low viral load. D2 is seen in Albania, Turkey, Brazil, western India, Lebanon, and Serbia. D3 was reported from Serbia, western India, and Indonesia. It is a predominant subgenotype in injection drug use-related acute HBV infections in Europe and Canada. D4 is relatively rare and reported from Haiti, Russia and Baltic region, Brazil, Kenya, Morocco and Rwanda. Subgenotype D5 seems to be common in Eastern India. D6 has been reported as a rare subgenotype from Indonesia, Kenya, Russia and Baltic region. D7 is the main genotype in Morocco and Tunisia. D8 and D9 are recently described subgenotypes and reported from Niger and India, respectively. Subgenotypes of genotype D may have clinical and/or viral differences. More subgenotype studies are required to conclude on subgenotype and its clinical/viral characteristics.","Ozaras R, Inanc Balkan I, Yemisen M, Tabak F",Clin Res Hepatol Gastroenterol,2015 Feb,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
36788421,Updates on Organoid Model for the Study of Liver Cancer.,"Liver cancer remains one of the most common cancers worldwide with limited therapy options. The main risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of liver cancer, include chronic infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C viruses, alcohol abuse, and metabolic disease. Current systemic therapies for advanced HCCs have greatly improved in the last decade, but there is still a need to develop more targeted drug therapy for HCCs. The development of liver organoids, a self-organising and self-renewal three-dimensional cell culture model, has greatly improved cancer research, including liver cancer. The generation of liver organoids provides a physiologically relevant model to study cancer drug screening and development, personalized medicine, liver disease modeling, and liver regeneration. However, the advent of organoid development also comes with few shortcomings that must be overcome, including the high cost of the model, the availability of origin tissues, and the need for multilineage liver organoids to replicate the true cellular heterogeneity of the liver. Despite all the limitations, liver organoids provide a reliable in vitro model for translational applications to develop more effective HCC therapy and to understand the underlying pathogenic mechanism in various liver diseases.","El-Khobar KE, Sukowati CHC",Technol Cancer Res Treat,2023 Jan-Dec,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
39599836,"Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Clinical Profiles of Hepatitis D Virus in Nigeria: A Systematic Review, 2009-2024.","BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends hepatitis D virus (HDV) screening among hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected individuals, with a focus on priority populations in resource-limited settings like Nigeria. HDV infection is a growing public health challenge, particularly among individuals with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. HDV accelerates liver disease progression and significantly increases the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite this, the epidemiology of HDV in Nigeria remains inadequately documented. This scoping review critically evaluates the prevalence, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of HDV co-infection among HBV patients in Nigeria. METHOD: We conducted a systematic review following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. The review included observational cross-sectional studies published between 2009 and 2024. We focused on studies that used Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody testing or RNA-based diagnostics to assess HDV prevalence. We included PubMed, Google Scholar, and Dimensions databases due to their broad indexing and coverage of peer-reviewed articles and accessibility. We screened the studies for their relevance to HDV prevalence, risk factors, and clinical outcomes, while excluding those that only tested for IgM or HDV antigen. Eleven studies, with a combined sample size of 2308 participants, were included in the final analysis. We performed a narrative synthesis of the findings, considering geographic, gender, and age-based variations in HDV prevalence and clinical impact. RESULTS: HDV prevalence among HBV-infected individuals in Nigeria ranged from 2.0% to 31.6%. The highest prevalence was reported in the Southwest (31.6%) among malaria patients, while lower rates were observed in the Southeast (2.8%). Prevalence was higher in males, particularly those aged 21-30 years in the Southwest and 31-40 years in other regions. RNA-based testing provided more accurate data on active viremia, with viremic HDV prevalence rates ranging from 3.2% to 16%. Triple infection with HIV/HBV/HDV was associated with significantly lower CD4+ cell counts and worse clinical outcomes, including elevated liver enzymes and rapid progression to liver cancer. Key risk factors for HDV co-infection included multiple sexual partners, sharing of needles, and unsafe medical practices. Co-infected patients demonstrated worse clinical outcomes, such as elevated liver enzymes, decompensated cirrhosis, and higher rates of hepatocellular carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Our review underscores the urgent need for routine HDV screening among HBV patients in Nigeria, especially given the severe clinical consequences of co-infection. The recent WHO guidelines recommending HDV screening align with our findings, which emphasize the importance of RNA-based HDV testing among HBV-positive patients to improve diagnostic accuracy. Public health efforts should prioritize tailored interventions based on geographic, age, and gender disparities in HDV prevalence. Triple infection with HIV/HBV/HDV requires integrated care models to address both immune suppressions as indicated by diminished CD4 cell count and liver disease progression, as these patients face worse outcomes. Targeted HDV screening in mostly affected demographics and geographies and improved Nigeria capacity for cheaper HDV RNA/PCR diagnostics can reduce liver-related morbidity and mortality caused by HBV, which can be worsened and accelerated by HDV coinfection.","Adepoju VA, Udah DC, Adnani QES",Viruses,2024 Oct 31,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
35875205,Association of Toll-Like Receptor 2 (TLR2) Expression in Placenta and Intrauterine Exposure to Hepatitis B Virus.,"INTRODUCTION: The placenta is a specialized organ that only performs during pregnancy and serves as an immunological barrier in preventing pathogens to reach the fetus. It has been known that toll-like receptors (TLRs) on the placenta respond to antigens, such as zymosan, lipopolysaccharide, and other viral infections. This study analyzes the distribution of TLR2 protein and hepatitis B DNA virus (HBV DNA) virus identification to gain an understanding of hepatitis B viral transmission from the mother to child. METHODS: We performed enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay of HBeAg, HBsAg titer, Anti-HBs, and Anti-HBc to 59 HBsAg-positive pregnant women and identified HBV DNA using nested PCR in their cord blood during delivery for evidence of exposure to HBV DNA. The expression of TLR2 protein in the placenta was performed using immunohistochemistry analysis. RESULTS: Intrauterine exposure to the hepatitis B virus occurred in 69.5% of all pregnant women who were HbsAg positive. TLR2 expression was predominantly identified in syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast cells with the highest score in mothers aged 20-35 years (75%), multigravida (58.3%), and mothers with term pregnancies (70.8%). Statistical analysis results showed that placental TLR2 expression did not indicate any association with hepatitis B virus DNA identified in cord blood with a p value of 0.730 and an OR of 0.650 (95% CI 0.173-2.440). CONCLUSION: TLR2 expression is not associated with intrauterine exposure of hepatitis B virus.","Utami D, Chalid MT, Masadah R, Sjahril R, Bahagia Febriani AD",Interdiscip Perspect Infect Dis,2022,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia

Mothers with history of chronic liver disease were excluded. Data were collected by questionnaires including obstetric history, hepatitis B immunization history, and the presence of jaundice; maternal venous blood samples were taken before parturition for HBsAg determination that was performed by ELISA. RESULTS: of 1,009 parturient women screened for hepatitis B infection, 22 were found positive, giving an overall hepatitis B prevalence of 2.2%, previous 5.2% in 1985. None of the subjects had any symptoms of HBV infection. The highest HBsAg prevalence was found in the East Jakarta study site, with predominance in mothers aged <20 years and those with multi-parities. CONCLUSION: present prevalence of HBsAg among Indonesian parturient women in Jakarta was 2.2% and markedly reduced compared with prevalence in 1985.","Gunardi H, Zaimi LF, Soedjatmiko, Turyadi, Harahap AR, Muljono DH",Acta Med Indones,2014 Jan,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
37260808,Association Between Serum Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Antigen (CTLA)-4 Level and Disease Progression in Patients With Chronic Hepatitis B.,"BACKGROUD: Immune impairment, marked by increased expression of cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4, promotes the disease progression of chronic hepatitis B. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the association between serum CTLA-4 level and disease progression in patients with chronic hepatitis B. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at Haji Adam Malik General Hospital Medan, Indonesia between October 2021 to September 2022. A total of 150 participants were enrolled. Patients aged 18 years or older with evidence of chronic hepatitis B, HBV-related liver cirrhosis, and HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were enrolled. Exclusion criteria were history of chronic hepatotoxic drug consumption, underlying liver abnormalities other than HBV infection, and liver injury due to metastasized malignancy from other sites. Serum CTLA-4 level was determined from serum using human CTLA-4 enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kit. RESULTS: Most participants were males and aged between 40 and 60 years. Serum CTLA-4 level was positively associated with chronic hepatitis B progression (P<0.001). Serum CTLA-4 level was negatively correlated with serum platelet (P<0.001) and albumin levels (P<0.001) but positively correlated with serum ALT (P=0.045) and total bilirubin levels (P<0.001).

Therefore, new hepatitis B sources are needed. This study aimed to evaluate the immunogenicity of the DTP-HB-Hib vaccine (Bio Farma) that used a different source of hepatitis B. A prospective randomized, double-blind, bridging study was conducted. Subjects were divided into two groups with different batch numbers. Healthy infants 6-11 weeks of age at enrollment were immunized with three doses of the DTP-HB-Hib vaccine after a birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine. Blood samples were obtained prior to vaccination and 28 days after the third dose. Adverse events were recorded until 28 days after each dose. Of the 220 subjects, 205 (93.2%) completed the study protocol. The proportion of infants with anti-diphtheria and anti-tetanus titers >/= 0.01 IU/mL was 100%, with anti-HBsAg titers >/= 10 mIU/mL was 100%, and with Polyribosylribitol Phosphate-Tetanus Conjugate (PRP-TT) titers > 0.15 microg/mL was 96.1%. The pertussis response rate was 84.9%. No serious adverse events related to the study vaccine occurred.

26392157,"High Prevalence of Hepatitis B Virus Infection in Young Adults in Ternate, Eastern Indonesia.","The incidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has been declining thanks to the universal hepatitis B infant immunization program. Nevertheless, young adults born before the program implementation might have acquired HBV in early childhood or remain susceptible to infection. This study aimed to evaluate hepatitis B epidemiology in asymptomatic young adult population in Ternate, eastern Indonesia. Serum samples of 376 subjects (aged 17-25, mean 19.82 +/- 1.69 years; male/female 138/238) were screened for HBV parameters serologically (HBV surface antigen [HBsAg]; its antibody [anti-HBs]; anti-core antigen [anti-HBc]), and molecularly (HBV DNA). HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HBs, and HBV DNA prevalence were 15.7%, 36.2%, 24.2%, and 27.9%, respectively, with male predominance. Of all subjects, 13.0% were HBsAg negative with detectable HBV DNA (occult hepatitis B [OHB]), and 56.4% showed negativity for all seromarkers. This population showed high hepatitis B prevalence with substantial occurrence of OHB. However, a high percentage of the population were still susceptible and at risk of HBV infection. This study emphasizes the necessity to improve prevention strategies to screen and manage HBV carriers, including the adoption of catch-up or booster vaccination targeted to young adult populations. Investigations on the roles of host-virus interactions associated with OHB and its implications are warranted.","Ie SI, Turyadi, Sidarta E, Sadhewa A, Purnomo GA, Soedarmono YS, Pattiiha MZ, Thedja MD, Harahap AR, Muljono DH",Am J Trop Med Hyg,2015 Dec,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
27624502,Hepatitis B virus infection in children of HBV-related chronic liver disease patients: a study of intra-familial HBV transmission.,"BACKGROUND: HBV-infected patients are potential sources of intra-familial transmission. We studied HBV transmission and molecular characteristics within families of HBV-related chronic liver disease (CLD) patients. METHODS: Family members [index cases (ICs), spouses, and 1-18-year-old children] of HBV-related CLD patients were tested for HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs. HBsAg-positive subjects were tested for HBeAg/anti-HBe. Anti-HBc-positive children together with their family members were further investigated for HBV DNA. Sequences of positive isolates were analyzed over surface, precore (PC) and basal core promoter (BCP) regions. RESULTS: Among 94 children of 46 ICs, the prevalence of HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs was 10 (10.6 %), 19 (20.2 %), and 46 (48.9 %), respectively. Thirty-eight (40.4 %) children were seronegative, indicating susceptibility to HBV infection. HBV DNA was identified in all ICs, 4 spouses, and 16 children. Having both parents with HBsAg positive and at least two HBV carriers in the households were significant risk factors of intra-familial transmission. HBV genotype/subtype distributions were comparable between children and ICs/spouses, with predominance of genotype B. The majority of HBV DNA sequences found in children were identical to their corresponding ICs-particularly mothers-including mutation patterns in the surface, PC, and BCP regions. Recognized mutations associated with HBsAg detection and/or vaccination failure, T140I, T143S/M, G145R, and Y161F, were identified in 20 subjects; while mutations linked to HBeAg-defective variants, PC G1896A and BCP A1762T/G1764A, were found in 7 and 11 subjects, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Children of HBV-related CLD patients were at increased risk of HBV infection through multi-modal transmission routes despite negative parental HBsAg and HBeAg status.","Gunardi H, Iskandar MY, Turyadi, Ie SI, Dwipoerwantoro PG, Gani RA, Muljono DH",Hepatol Int,2017 Jan,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
36064856,A cautionary note to hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative test results in pregnant women in an area prevalent of HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B.,"Maternal hepatitis B e Antigen (HBeAg) positivity poses a risk for hepatitis B virus (HBV) mother-to-child transmission (MTCT). In resource-constrained settings, HBeAg testing is recommended as an alternative to HBV DNA testing to establish antiviral prophylaxis eligibility. Nevertheless, the high prevalence of HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (e-CHB) in many countries should not be overlooked. We studied HBV characteristics and explored the potential MTCT risk among HBeAg-negative/HBsAg-positive expectant mothers in an area prevalent of e-CHB. Among 1348 pregnant mothers screened for HBV infection, 81 (6.0%) were HBsAg-positive. These women were examined for HBeAg, HBV DNA, and cord blood HBV DNA. Sixteen (19.8%) of the HBsAg-positive mothers were HBeAg-positive, whereas 65 (80.2%) were HBeAg-negative, including eight inactive carriers (HBsAg <100 IU/ml, HBV DNA </= 2000 IU/ml, and ALT < 40 IU/L). Of the remaining 57 HBeAg-negative mothers, ten revealed HBV Basal Core Promoter or Precore mutations, with three having high viremia (HBV DNA > 200 000 IU/mL), which is associated with a high MTCT risk and therefore qualifies them for antiviral prophylaxis. This pilot study provides a cautionary note to the interpretation of negative HBeAg test results when determining eligibility for MTCT antiviral prophylaxis in situations with limited resources and in regions where e-CHB is prevalent.","Chalid MT, Turyadi, Ie SI, Sjahril R, Wahyuni R, Nasrum Massi M, Muljono DH",J Med Virol,2023 Jan,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia

37519778,Development of Chimeric Hepatitis B (HBV) - Norovirus (NoV) P particle as candidate vaccine against Hepatitis B and norovirus infection.,"INTRODUCTION: Hepatitis B remains a global problem with no effective treatment. Here, a mucosal vaccine candidate was developed with HBsAg and HBcAg, to provide both prophylactic and therapeutic protection against hepatitis B. The antigens were presented using the P particle of human norovirus (HuNov). As a result, the chimeric HBV - HuNoV P particle can act as a dual vaccine for hepatitis B and HuNoV. METHODS: The vaccine candidate was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. HBV-HuNoV chimeric P particles were successfully expressed and isolated, with sizes of approximately 25.64 nm. Then, the HBV-HuNoV chimeric P particles were evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in mice and gnotobiotic (Gn) pigs. After three doses (5 microg/dose in mice and 200 microg/dose in Gn pigs) of intranasal immunization, humoral and cellular immune responses, as well as toxicity, were evaluated. RESULTS: The vaccine candidate induced strong HBV-HuNoV specific IFN-gamma producing T-cell responses in the ileum, spleen, and blood of Gn pigs. Serum IgG and IgA antibodies against HBV-HuNoV chimeric P particles also increased significantly in Gn pigs. Increased HBsAg- and HuNoV-specific serum IgG responses were observed in mice and Gn pigs, although not statistically significant. The vaccine candidate did not show any toxicity in mice. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the chimeric HBV-HuNoV P particle vaccine given intranasally was safe and induced strong cellular and humoral immune responses in Gn pig. Modifications to the vaccine structure and dosage need to be evaluated in future studies to further enhance immunogenicity and induce more balanced humoral and cellular responses.","Giri-Rachman EA, Irasonia Tan M, Ramesh A, Fajar PA, Nurul Ilmi A, Retnoningrum DS, Hertadi R, Irawan A, Wojciechowska GEP, Yuan L",Vaccine X,2023 Aug,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia

METHODS: Ninety-seven sera from chronic hepatitis B patients were collected in this study. Hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid levels were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Quantitative hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B e antigen levels were determined by two-site sandwich chemiluminescence immunoassay. Alanine transaminase levels were measured by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry-approved methods. RESULTS: A significant correlation between quantitative hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid levels was observed in hepatitis B e antigen-positive group (r = 0.453, P = .002), but not in hepatitis B e antigen-negative group (r = 0.117, P = .454). No significant correlation between quantitative hepatitis B surface antigen and alanine transaminase was found in the hepatitis B e antigen-positive group (r = 0.521, P = .241). However, a significant correlation was shown between quantitative hepatitis B surface antigen and alanine transaminase levels in the hepatitis B e antigen-negative group (r = 0.455, P = .001). The best cut-off value of quantitative hepatitis B surface antigen for predicting high hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid levels was 3.422 x 103 IU/mL. CONCLUSION: Correlation between quantitative hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid levels is significant in the hepatitis B e antigen-positive group. Quantitative hepatitis B surface antigen can be used to predict high hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid levels in the hepatitis B e antigen-positive group.","Nirmala VFI, Aryati A, Susianti H, Mustika S",Turk J Gastroenterol,2023 Apr,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia

The objectives of this survey were to evaluate the extent of pre-travel health advice, the prevalence of behaviours with HBV infection risks and the prevalence of HBV vaccination amongst Australian travellers to Southeast Asia and East Asia. METHODS: In 2004, a telephone survey was conducted amongst Australians, who had travelled overseas to Southeast Asia and East Asia in the past three years for three nights or more. RESULTS: Three hundred and nine travellers aged 14 years and over completed the interview, including 138 males (45%) and 171 females (55%). Respondents travelled for leisure (64%), business (20%), and visiting friends and relatives (VFR) (16%). The most common destinations were Indonesia (34%), Thailand (32%), and China (27%). About half of the travellers (54%) sought vaccination specific health advice before travel of which about half (56%) had sought this advice more than six weeks before travel. Just over one quarter of travellers reported receiving HBV vaccination (28%) of whom most (70%) were vaccinated at least three weeks before travel. About half of the travellers (49%) had participated in at least one activity with HBV risk during their last overseas trip. Of those travellers aged 18 years and over who either had no HBV vaccination or who were unsure, about half (49%) had participated in at least one activity with HBV risk during their last overseas trip. CONCLUSIONS: Australian travellers to Southeast Asia and East Asia commonly undertake activities with a risk of exposure to HBV. Hepatitis B vaccination coverage amongst this group remains low. It is important that travellers to this region seek travel health advice from a qualified source, which will include a risk assessment for hepatitis B vaccination.","Leggat PA, Zwar NA, Hudson BJ",Travel Med Infect Dis,2009 Nov,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
29846357,Seroprevalence of Hepatitis B Among HIV-infected Children and Adolescents Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy in the TREAT Asia Pediatric HIV Observational Database.,"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B (HBV)-HIV coinfection is associated with liver inflammation, which can progress to liver fibrosis/cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. We determined HBV seroprevalence in children and adolescents participating in the TREAT Asia Pediatric HIV Observational Database. METHODS: A multisite cross-sectional study was conducted in HIV-infected patients currently <25 years old receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) who had HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), or HBV surface antibody (anti-HBs) or HBV core antibody (anti-HBc) tested during 2012-2013. HBV coinfection was defined as having either a positive HBsAg test or being anti-HBc positive and anti-HBs negative, reflective of past HBV infection. HBV seroprotection was defined as having a positive anti-HBs test. RESULTS: A total of 3380 patients from 6 countries (Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Indonesia and India) were included. The current median (interquartile range) age was 11.2 (7.8-15.1) years. Of the 2755 patients (81.5%) with HBsAg testing, 130 (4.7%) were positive. Of 1558 (46%) with anti-HBc testing, 77 (4.9%) were positive. Thirteen of 1037 patients with all 3 tests were anti-HBc positive and HBsAg and anti-HBs negative. One child was positive for anti-HBc and negative for anti-HBs but did not have HBsAg tested. The prevalence of HBV coinfection was 144/2759 (5.2%) (95% confidence interval: 4.4-6.1). Of 1093 patients (32%) with anti-HBs testing, 257 (23.5%; confidence interval: 21.0-26.0) had positive tests representing HBV seroprotection. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated prevalence of HBV coinfection in this cohort of Asian HIV-infected children and adolescents on ART was 5.2%. The majority of children and adolescents tested in this cohort (76.5%) did not have protective HBV antibody. The finding supports HBV screening of HIV-infected children and adolescents to guide revaccination, the use of ART with anti-HBV activity and future monitoring.","Aurpibul L, Kariminia A, Vibol U, Fong MS, Le ON, Hansudewechakul R, Bunupuradah T, Kurniati N, Chokephaibulkit K, Kumarasamy N, Wati DK, Yusoff NKN, Razali KAM, Nallusamy RA, Sohn AH, Lumbiganon P",Pediatr Infect Dis J,2018 Aug,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
26933963,Hepatitis B and C Co-Infection in HIV Patients from the TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database: Analysis of Risk Factors and Survival.,"BACKGROUND: We assessed the effects of hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) co-infection on outcomes of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-infected patients enrolled in the TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database (TAHOD), a multi-center cohort of HIV-infected patients in the Asia-Pacific region. METHODS: Patients testing HBs antigen (Ag) or HCV antibody (Ab) positive within enrollment into TAHOD were considered HBV or HCV co-infected. Factors associated with HBV and/or HCV co-infection were assessed by logistic regression models. Factors associated with post-ART HIV immunological response (CD4 change after six months) and virological response (HIV RNA <400 copies/ml after 12 months) were also determined. Survival was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method and log rank test. RESULTS: A total of 7,455 subjects were recruited by December 2012. Of patients tested, 591/5656 (10.4%) were HBsAg positive, 794/5215 (15.2%) were HCVAb positive, and 88/4966 (1.8%) were positive for both markers. In multivariate analysis, HCV co-infection, age, route of HIV infection, baseline CD4 count, baseline HIV RNA, and HIV-1 subtype were associated with immunological recovery. Age, route of HIV infection, baseline CD4 count, baseline HIV RNA, ART regimen, prior ART and HIV-1 subtype, but not HBV or HCV co-infection, affected HIV RNA suppression. Risk factors affecting mortality included HCV co-infection, age, CDC stage, baseline CD4 count, baseline HIV RNA and prior mono/dual ART. Shortest survival was seen in subjects who were both HBV- and HCV-positive. CONCLUSION: In this Asian cohort of HIV-infected patients, HCV co-infection, but not HBV co-infection, was associated with lower CD4 cell recovery after ART and increased mortality.","Chen M, Wong WW, Law MG, Kiertiburanakul S, Yunihastuti E, Merati TP, Lim PL, Chaiwarith R, Phanuphak P, Lee MP, Kumarasamy N, Saphonn V, Ditangco R, Sim BL, Nguyen KV, Pujari S, Kamarulzaman A, Zhang F, Pham TT, Choi JY, Oka S, Kantipong P, Mustafa M, Ratanasuwan W, Durier N, Chen YM",PLoS One,2016,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
23919229,"Hepatitis B and C virus infection among hemodialysis patients in Yogyakarta, Indonesia: Prevalence and molecular evidence for nosocomial transmission.","Hemodialysis patients are at an increased risk of acquiring hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. However, the prevalence of hepatitis viral infection and its genotype distribution among hemodialysis patients in Indonesia are unclear. In order to investigate these issues and the possibility of nosocomial transmission, 161 hemodialysis patients and 35 staff members at one of the hemodialysis unit in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, were tested for serological and virological markers of both viruses. HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) was detected in 18 patients (11.2%) and in two staff members (5.7%). Anti-HCV was detected in 130 patients (80.7%) but not in any staff members. Occult HBV and HCV infection were detected in 21 (14.7%) and 4 (12.9%) patients, respectively. The overall prevalence rates of HBV and HCV infection among patients were 24.2% and 83.2%, respectively. HCV infection was independently associated with hemodialysis duration and the number of blood transfusions. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 23 of 39 tested HBV strains (59%) were genotype B, 11 (28.2%) were genotype C, and 5 (12.8%) were genotype A. HCV genotype 1a was dominant (95%) among 100 tested HCV strains. Nosocomial transmission was suspected because the genotype distribution differed from that of the general population in Indonesia, and because the viral genomes of several strains were identical. These findings suggest that HBV and HCV infection is common among hemodialysis patients in Yogyakarta, and probably occurs through nosocomial infection. Implementation of strict infection-control programs is necessary in hemodialysis units in Indonesia.","Rinonce HT, Yano Y, Utsumi T, Heriyanto DS, Anggorowati N, Widasari DI, Lusida MI, Soetjipto, Prasanto H, Hotta H, Hayashi Y",J Med Virol,2013 Aug,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
9886108,Hepatitis A virus: declining seroprevalence in children and adolescents in Southeast Asia.,"The prevalence of hepatitis A virus (HAV) in a country largely reflects its standards of hygiene and socioeconomic conditions. Countries which undergo socioeconomic development show major change in HAV prevalence from high to low endemicity, and this is largely reflected in patterns of age-related seroprevalence. This paper presents age-related HAV seroprevalence patterns of SE Asian countries, and highlights how these patterns have changed over recent decades. Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia have experienced a decline in childhood and adolescent HAV seroprevalence, typical of countries which undergo socioeconomic development. By contrast, India has remained a country of high endemicity, with almost universal seroconversion in childhood. The Philippines and Vietnam show age-related seroprevalence patterns typical of high to moderate endemicity, while Indonesia shows significant regional variation in HAV seroprevalence. Populations within countries which exhibit major improvements in endemicity and age related HAV seroprevalence patterns are at risk of HAV epidemics, and a paradoxical increase in incidence tends to occur as seroconversion shifts from children to adults. The residents of these countries, a significant number of whom are at-risk, would benefit from a program of vaccination, as would non-infected individuals visiting high-risk areas.","Kunasol P, Cooksley G, Chan VF, Isahak I, John J, Loleka S, Villar EP, Poovorawan Y, Seong NH, Sulaiman HA, Wah LB",Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health,1998 Jun,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
25964874,Viral hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus co-infections in Asia.,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) affect many people in Asian countries, although there are geographic differences. Both HBV and HIV (HBV/HIV) and HCV/HIV co-infections are highly prevalent in Asia. Hetero- and homosexual, injection drug use, and geographic area are strong predictors of HBV, HCV, and HIV serostatus. In HBV endemic regions, the prevalence and genotype distribution of HBV/HIV co-infection is almost comparable with that in the general population. In Japan, where HBV has low endemicity, the prevalence of HBV/HIV co-infection is approximately 10-fold higher than that in the general population, and HBV Ae is the most common subgenotype among HIV infected individuals. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is an effective treatment for HIV/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. Lamivudine, a component of HAART, is an effective treatment for HBV, HIV, and HBV/HIV co-infection; however, cost, emerging drug resistance, antiretroviral-associated liver toxicity and liver-related morbidity due to HCV progression are particular concerns. HCV/HIV co-infection may accelerate the clinical progression of both HCV and HIV. The high prevalence of HBV/HIV and HCV/HIV co-infections in Asia underscores the need to improve prevention and control measures, as fewer evidence-based prevention strategies are available (compared with Western countries). In this review, the most recent publications on the prevalence of HBV/HIV and HCV/HIV co-infections and related issues, such as therapy and problems in Asia, are updated and summarized.","Utsumi T, Lusida MI",World J Virol,2015 May 12,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia

30905683,KLRG1+ natural killer cells exert a novel antifibrotic function in chronic hepatitis B.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Natural killer (NK) cells are known to exert strong antiviral activity. Killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily G member 1 (KLRG1) is expressed by terminally differentiated NK cells and KLRG1-expressing lymphocytes are known to expand following chronic viral infections. We aimed to elucidate the previously unknown role of KLRG1 in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). METHODS: KLRG1+ NK cells were taken from the blood and liver of healthy individuals and patients with CHB. The phenotype and function of these cells was assessed using flow cytometry and in vitro stimulation. RESULTS: Patients with CHB had a higher frequency of KLRG1+ NK cells compared to healthy controls (blood 13.4 vs. 2.3%, p <0.0001 and liver 23.4 vs. 2.6%, p <0.01). KLRG1+ NK cells were less responsive to K562 and cytokine stimulation, but demonstrated enhanced cytotoxicity (9.0 vs. 4.8%, p <0.05) and IFN-gamma release (8.0 vs. 1.5%, p <0.05) via antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity compared to their KLRG1- counterparts. KLRG1+ NK cells possessed a mature phenotype, demonstrating stronger cytolytic activity and IFN-gamma secretion against hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) than KLRG1- NK cells. Moreover, KLRG1+ NK cells more effectively induced primary HSC apoptosis in a TRAIL-dependent manner. Increased KLRG1+ NK cell frequency in the liver and blood was associated with lower fibrosis stage (F0/F1) in patients with CHB. Finally, the expression of CD44, degranulation and IFN-gamma production were all increased in KLRG1+ NK cells following stimulation with osteopontin, the CD44 ligand, suggesting that HSC-derived osteopontin may cause KLRG1+ NK cell activation. CONCLUSIONS: KLRG1+ NK cells likely play an antifibrotic role during the natural course of CHB infection. Harnessing this antifibrotic function may provide a novel therapeutic approach to treat liver fibrosis in patients with CHB. LAY SUMMARY: Individuals that are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) possess an increased number of immune cells, called natural killer (NK) cells expressing the surface marker KLRG1 in the blood and liver. Here, we demonstrate that these specific NK cells are able to kill activated stellate cells in the liver. Because activated stellate cells contribute to liver scarring, i.e. fibrosis, and subsequent liver dysfunction in individuals with chronic HBV infection, KLRG1+ NK cells are a novel immune cell type that can limit liver scarring.","Wijaya RS, Read SA, Schibeci S, Eslam M, Azardaryany MK, El-Khobar K, van der Poorten D, Lin R, Yuen L, Lam V, George J, Douglas MW, Ahlenstiel G",J Hepatol,2019 Aug,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
31086664,"Analysis of hepatitis B virus genotype and gene mutation in patients with advanced liver disease in East Kalimantan, Indonesia.","Liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are life-threatening conditions frequently associated with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Asian countries, including Indonesia. HBV genotypes and several specific mutations are associated with disease progression. To clarify the geographical variation in viral characteristics, HBV genotypes and gene mutations were investigated in patients with advanced liver disease (ALD) in Samarinda, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Sera were collected from 41 patients with ALD at Abdul Wahab Sjahranie Hospital and HBV carriers from Red Cross Center blood bank in Samarinda, and screened for hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B e-antigen. Liver function data were obtained from the medical records from each patient. HBV genotype and gene mutations were determined by polymerase chain reaction sequencing. Analysis of HBV isolates indicated that genotype B was the most frequent genotype, at 85.4 and 97.8%, followed by C, at 14.6 and 2.2%, in patients with ALD and in HBV carriers, respectively. The C1505A mutation in X region, T1753V and A1762T/G1764A mutations in the basal core promoter region and C1858T in precore (PC) region were frequent and only detected in patients with ALD (28.9, 40, 73.5 and 17.6%, respectively), whereas the G1896A mutation in the PC region was frequently detected in HBV carriers.

The association between the knowledge of hepatitis A and incidence of infection was also determined. Serum samples were obtained from 88 individuals with clinical manifestations of acute hepatitis in Lamongan (n=54) in January 2018 and Bangkalan (n=34) in March 2018. The outbreak investigation was started one day after the outbreaks were reported by the Public Health Offices in Lamongan and Bangkalan. Anti-HAV immunoglobulin M (IgM) and PCR amplification products of the VP1 capsid protein-P2A protease and VP1-VP3 junctions were analysed. Positive PCR products were sequenced, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis X software. The control group comprised healthy students and staff members from the two affected areas. Thus, 172 responses from the control and hepatitis A case groups were analysed to assess the association between the students' knowledge level and the incidence of HAV infection. A total of 32 (59.25%) of the 54 individuals from Lamongan and 19 (55.9%) of the 34 participants from Bangkalan were positive for anti-HAV IgM; 26 PCR tests were positive in the VP3-VP1 and/or VP1-P2A junction, which were identified as HAV subgenotype IA. The subtype of HAV in the two areas was IA, similar to those identified previously, but the viruses did not originate from the same strain, as identified by multiple alignment. The knowledge level of the students and staff members in Lamongan studying and working at a half-day school exhibited a significant association with the incidence; however, no association was observed among the students in Bangkalan studying at a full-day school with a dormitory.","Setyowati D, Mubawadi T, Mirasa YA, Purwanto D, Amin M, Utsumi T, Soetjipto S, Juniastuti J, Lusida MI",Biomed Rep,2020 Feb,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia

HBsAg, anti-HBs and anti-HBc as HBV markers and anti-HCV (ELISA, Ortho) as an HCV marker were tested. Positive rates of HBsAg and anti HCV among blood donors were 7.1% and 3.1% respectively, and there was no significant difference among age groups. Donors negative for all viral markers accounted for 21.4%. Of acute hepatitis cases, 18 (23.1%) cases were hepatitis A and 8 (10.3%) cases were hepatitis B, one case of which was considered to be double infection. Acute exacerbation cases of HBV carriers were 16 (20.5%), of which 6 cases were positive for HCV antibody. Those diagnosed non-A, non-B hepatitis were 37 (47.4%), of which 3 cases where positive for HCV antibody.

37851688,Global regulatory reforms to promote equitable vaccine access in the next pandemic.,"There is broad consensus that the global response to the Covid-19 pandemic was inadequate, leading to unacceptable levels of avoidable morbidity and mortality. Three strategic missteps led to the lack of equitable vaccine access: The heavy reliance on commercial vaccine manufacturers in high-income countries (HICs) versus low- and middle-income countries (LMICs); the emergence of vaccine nationalism restricting and delaying the supply of vaccines to LMICs; and an inadequate support or recognition for LMIC national regulatory authorities. To avoid these inequities in a future pandemic, we focus on three successful vaccine development and technology transfer case studies-the Hepatitis B vaccine produced in South Korea in the 1980s; the Meningitis A vaccine for Africa led by Program for Appropriate Technologies in Health (PATH) and the World Health Organization (WHO) in the 2000s; and a recombinant SARS CoV-2 protein-based vaccine technology from the Texas Children's Hospital transferred to India and to Indonesia. In addition to expanding support for academic or non-profit product development partnerships, our analysis finds that an essential step is the strengthening of selected LMIC regulatory systems to become Stringent Regulatory Authorities (SRAs), together with a re-prioritization of the WHO Prequalification (PQ) system to ensure early vaccine availability in LMICs especially during pandemics. Advancing LMIC National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) to Stringent Regulatory Authorities (SRAs) status will require substantial resources, but the benefits for future pandemic control and for health in LMIC would be immense. We call on the WHO, United Nation (UN) agencies and SRAs, to collaborate and implement a comprehensive roadmap to support LMIC regulators to achieve stringent status by 2030.","Mahoney R, Hotez PJ, Bottazzi ME",PLOS Glob Public Health,2023,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia

It may lead to prolonged liver damage, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Persistent chronic HBV infection is related to host immune response and the stability of the covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in human hepatocytes. In addition to being essential for viral transcription and replication, cccDNA is also suspected to play a role in persistent HBV infections or hepatitis relapses since cccDNA is very stable in non-dividing human hepatocytes. Understanding the pathogenicity and oncogenicity of HBV components would be essential in the development of new diagnostic tools and treatment strategies.

One-half to one-third of the total HBV infected people died due to late detection of HBV. Serological antigen and viral HBV detections can help in the diagnosis, referral, and treatment of HBV. Available methods for HBV detection mostly used bulky instruments. Miniaturization of devices for HBV detection has been started by narrowing down the size of the devices. Several methods have also been proposed to increase the selectivity and sensitivity of the miniaturized methods, such as sandwich recognition of the biomarkers and the use of nano- to micro-sized materials. This review presents recent HBV detections in the last two decades from laboratory-based instruments towards microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (microPADs) for point-of-care testing (POCT) purposes. Early and routine analysis to detect HBV as early as possible could be achieved by POCT, especially for areas with limited access to a central laboratory and/or medical facilities.","Tyas AA, Raeni SF, Sakti SP, Sabarudin A",ScientificWorldJournal,2021,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
32134738,Indonesia: country report on children's environmental health.,"Children's bodies are in dynamic stages of development that make them more susceptible to harm from exposure to environmental agents. Children's physical, physiological and behavioral traits can lead to increased exposure to toxic chemicals or pathogens. In addition, the social determinants of health interact with this exposure and create an increasing risk for further disparities among children. In Indonesia, the fourth most populated country in the world, children are under threat of exposure to contaminated water, air, food and soil, which can cause gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases, birth defects and neurodevelopmental disorders. A safe and balanced nutrition is still an unmet need for too many children. At the same time, the prevalence of obesity and the risk of later development of metabolic diseases, including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, are increasing as a consequence of both unhealthy diets and inadequate physical activity. The risks of potential long-term toxicity, including carcinogenic, neurotoxic, immunotoxic, genotoxic, endocrine-disrupting and allergenic effects of many chemicals, are also close to their lives. This paper provides an overview of common disease risks in Indonesian children, including: acute hepatitis A, diarrheal diseases, dengue and malaria due to lack of water supply and sanitation, vectors, and parasites; asthma, bronchopneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute respiratory infections (ARIs) due to air pollution and climate change; some chronic diseases caused by toxic and hazardous waste; and direct or indirect consequences due to the occurrence of disasters and health emergencies.",Haryanto B,Rev Environ Health,2020 Mar 26,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia

We previously reported that a cellular hydrogen peroxide scavenger protein, peroxiredoxin 1, a target gene of transcription factor Nrf2, acts as a novel HBV X protein (HBx)-interacting protein and negatively regulates hepatitis B virus (HBV) propagation through degradation of HBV RNA. This study further demonstrates that the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway is activated during HBV infection, eventually leading to the suppression of HBV replication. We provide evidence suggesting that Keap1 interacts with HBx, leading to Nrf2 activation and inhibition of HBV replication via suppression of HBV core promoter activity. This study raises the possibility that activation of the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway is a potential therapeutic strategy against HBV. Our findings may contribute to an improved understanding of the negative regulation of HBV replication by the antioxidant response.","Ariffianto A, Deng L, Abe T, Matsui C, Ito M, Ryo A, Aly HH, Watashi K, Suzuki T, Mizokami M, Matsuura Y, Shoji I",J Virol,2023 Oct 31,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia

Of 149 patients with chronic liver disease including 24 with chronic hepatitis, 86 with liver cirrhosis, and 39 with primary hepatocellular carcinoma, HBsAg was detected in 40 (27%) and HCV RNA in 48 (32%); one patient was positive both for HBsAg and HCV RNA. Thus, the cause of chronic liver disease was not identified in 62 (42%) patients. Of 58 patients on maintenance hemodialysis, four (7%) were positive for HBsAg and 44 (76%) for HCV RNA. Subtype adw was found in 34 (74%) of 46 HBsAg samples and adr in five (11%); compound subtypes, such as adyw and adyr were detected in the remaining seven (15%). Among HCV RNA samples from 48 patients with chronic liver disease, 23 (48%) were of genotype II, 17 (35%) of genotype III and one (2%) of genotype V, in a distribution strikingly different from that of 44 samples from patients on maintenance hemodialysis, 39 (89%) of which were of genotype I and only one (2%) of genotype II. Genotypes were not classifiable in seven (15%) patients with liver disease and four (9%) patients on hemodialysis despite high HCV RNA titers in them all. These results indicate that different HCV genotypes prevail in patients with distinct diseases, as well as unclassifiable HCV genotypes in Indonesia.","Hadiwandowo S, Tsuda F, Okamoto H, Tokita H, Wang Y, Tanaka T, Miyakawa Y, Mayumi M",J Med Virol,1994 Jun,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
39147134,cccDNA epigenetic regulator as target for therapeutical vaccine development against hepatitis B.,"Chronic hepatitis B virus infection (CHB) remains a global health concern, with currently available antiviral therapies demonstrating limited effectiveness in preventing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. Two primary challenges in CHB treatment include the persistence of the minichromosome, covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), and the failure of the host immune response to eliminate cccDNA. Recent findings indicate several host and HBV proteins involved in the epigenetic regulation of cccDNA, including HBV core protein (HBc) and HBV x protein (HBx). Both proteins might contribute to the stability of the cccDNA minichromosome and interact with viral and host proteins to support transcription. One potential avenue for CHB treatment involves the utilization of therapeutic vaccines. This paper explores HBV antigens suitable for epigenetic manipulation of cccDNA, elucidates their mechanisms of action, and evaluates their potential as key components of epigenetically-driven vaccines for CHB therapy. Molecular targeted agents with therapeutic vaccines offer a promising strategy for addressing CHB by targeting the virus and enhancing the host's immunological response. Despite challenges, the development of these vaccines provides new hope for CHB patients by emphasizing the need for HBV antigens that induce effective immune responses without causing T cell exhaustion.","Naully PG, Tan MI, Agustiningsih A, Sukowati C, Giri-Rachman EA",Ann Hepatol,2024 Aug 13,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia

Blood samples were taken from the mother 3 h before delivery and from the newborn immediately after birth by cord blood, and they were then examined for anti-HBs using the Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immunoassay. RESULTS: Transplacental transfer of maternal anti-HBs was analyzed in 79 mother-infant pairs. Seventeen mothers (21.5%) had positive anti-HBs and all cord blood of newborns from these mothers had anti-HBs detected. Overall, there were 44 (55.7%) newborn blood cords that were positive for anti-HBs. The geometric mean of anti-HBs cord blood titers in newborns with maternal anti-HBs titers < 10, >/=10, >/= 100, and >/= 1,000 mIU/mL were 52.42, 193.83, 437.12, and >/= 1,000 mIU /mL respectively. This study showed a significant correlation in anti-HBs between mother and infant cord blood (r = 0.863; p < 0,001). CONCLUSIONS: Anti-HB antibodies measured in mother and infant cord blood were strongly correlated, demonstrating efficient transplacental antibody transfer to protect infants against Hepatitis B infection. Hepatitis B vaccination is required for mothers to obtain immunogenicity and babies to receive hepatitis B vaccination on time.","Ermaya YS, Nugraha ES, Girawan D, Risan NA, Bestari MB, Judistiani RTD, Yuniati T, Prasetyo D",BMC Pediatr,2025 Mar 18,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
24529845,"Hepatitis B virus prevalence, risk factors and genotype distribution in HIV infected patients from West Java, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: Indonesia currently faces both an increasing HIV incidence and a high hepatitis B virus (HBV) burden. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study is to examine the prevalence, risk factors, and genotypic distribution of HBV infection among HIV infected patients in West Java, Indonesia. STUDY DESIGN: A cross sectional study was conducted among a cohort of HIV infected patients in 2008. Demographic and disease related variables were compared between HBV negative and positive patients. Logistic regression was applied to determine risk factors for HBV co-infection. HBV and HIV genotyping was performed in co-infected patients. RESULTS: Of 636 HIV-infected patients, the rate of HBV co-infection was 7%. The proportion of males was higher in HBV/HIV co-infected patients than in HIV mono-infected patients (93% vs. 72%, P=0.001). A history of injecting drug use (IDU), but not tattooing, was associated with HBV co-infection [P=0.035 OR 2.41 (95% CI 1.06-5.47)]. In the HIV and HBV treatment naive patients, CD4 cells counts <50cells/mm(3), HIV-RNA plasma >/=10,000copies/ml and AST level above normal were more often found in patients with high HBV-DNA levels (>/=20,000IU/ml) as compared to those with low HBV DNA (<20.000IU/ml) (P<0.05). As in the general population, B3 was the dominant subtype in HBV co-infected patients. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of active HBV infection and the genotype distribution among HIV infected individuals is similar to the overall population in Java. However, an increased prevalence was observed in men with a history of IDU, underlining the need for routine HBV screening and monitoring.","Fibriani A, Wisaksana R, Alisjahbana B, Indrati A, Schutten M, van Crevel R, van der Ven A, Boucher CA",J Clin Virol,2014 Apr,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
30659645,"Analysis of genetic and serology of hepatitis A virus infection during and after outbreak in two junior high schools in Surabaya, Indonesia.","Outbreaks of hepatitis A have occurred in some cities in Indonesia. In Surabaya, the capital city of East Java province, Indonesia, hepatitis A outbreaks have been reported since2013, with a marked increase in the number of cases in 2015. The aim of the present study was to analyze the genetic and serology of acute symptomatic cases (early infection) during a hepatitis A outbreak and asymptomatic cases after the outbreak in two junior high schools in Surabaya in 2015 to 2016. Students with acute symptomatic hepatitis A during the outbreak and other students who were asymptomatic 3 to 4 months after the outbreak were enrolled. Asymptomatic students had no symptoms from the outbreak until they were enrolled. Sera were collected to identify anti-hepatitis A virus (HAV) IgM (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and HAV genetic variations/genotypes (using polymerase chain reaction [PCR]-sequencing and phylogenetic analysis). A total of 33 (97.1%) out of 34 sera of students with acute symptoms were positive for anti-HAV IgM and 18% of them were positive by PCR, identified as HAV subgenotype IA. No prominent amino acid variations were observed from reported HAV sequences from Indonesia. Among 38 sera of asymptomatic students, most (55.3%) were positive for anti-HAV IgM, while none were positive by PCR. In conclusion, HAV-IA was the only subgenotype identified in acute symptomatic cases during the outbreak. The percentage of HAV-specific IgM-positive cases was very high among acute symptomatic students, but that was also high among asymptomatic students, which might contribute as the important source of infection during the outbreak.","Juniastuti, Wahyuddin D, Nihayatussa'adah, Amin M, Yamani LN, Utsumi T, Sustini F, Lusida MI",J Med Virol,2019 Jun,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
18463220,"Novel subgenotypes of hepatitis B virus genotypes C and D in Papua, Indonesia.","Eight genotypes (A to H) and nine subtypes (adw2, adw4, ayw1, ayw2, ayw3, ayw4, adrq+, adrq-, and ayr) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) have been identified worldwide. They appear to be associated with geographical distribution, virological characteristics, and possibly clinical outcomes. We performed sequence analysis of part of the S gene and the entire precore/core gene of HBV isolates obtained from HBsAg-positive blood donors in Papua Province, Indonesia. Phylogenetic analysis of the S gene sequences revealed that 23 (85.2%) of the 27 HBV isolates tested belonged to genotype C (HBV/C) and 2 (7.4%) each to HBV/B and HBV/D. Interestingly, 19 (82.6%) of the 23 isolates of HBV/C clustered in a branch that was distinct from the previously reported subgenotypes C1 to C5 (HBV/C1 to HBV/C5). Similarly, two isolates of HBV/D clustered in a branch distinct from the reported subgenotypes HBV/D1 to HBV/D5. Phylogenetic analysis of the entire precore/core gene confirmed the consistent presence of the distinct branches in HBV/C and HBV/D. We therefore propose novel subgenotypes designated HBV/C6 and HBV/D6. The majority of HBV/C6 isolates in Papua had alanine at positions 159 and 177 (A159/A177) in the HBsAg. A159/A177 is different from the determinants for adrq+ (A159/V177), found throughout Asia, and adrq- (V159/A177), found in New Caledonia and Polynesia, possibly representing a unique antigenic group (provisionally referred to as adrq indeterminate). In conclusion, we have identified two novel HBV subgenotypes, HBV/C6 and HBV/D6, the first of which is the most prevalent subgenotype of HBV in Papua, Indonesia.","Lusida MI, Nugrahaputra VE, Soetjipto, Handajani R, Nagano-Fujii M, Sasayama M, Utsumi T, Hotta H",J Clin Microbiol,2008 Jul,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
19691824,"Hepatitis B virus genotypes/subgenotypes in voluntary blood donors in Makassar, South Sulawesi, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype appears to show varying geographic distribution. Molecular epidemiological study of HBV in particular areas in Indonesia is still limited. This study was aimed to identify the prevalence of HBV genotype/subgenotype and mutations in basal core promoter (BCP) region in voluntary blood donors in Makassar, one of the biggest cities in east part of Indonesia. A total of 214 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive samples were enrolled in this study. HBV genotype/subgenotype was identified by genotype-specific PCR method or direct sequencing of pre-S region. Mutations in BCP were identified by direct sequencing of the corresponding region. RESULTS: HBV/B and HBV/C were detected in 61.21% and 25.23% of the samples, while mix of HBV/B and HBV/C was found in 12.62% of the samples. Based on pre-S region, among HBV/B and HBV/C, HBV/B3 (95.00%) and HBV/C1 (58.82%) were predominant. Interestingly, HBV/D was identified in two samples (22.165.07 and 22.252.07). Complete genome sequences of two HBV/D strains (22.165.07 and 22.252.07) demonstrated that both strains belong to HBV/D6, and the divergence between the two strains were 1.45%, while divergences of both 22.165.07 and 22.252.07 strains with reference strain (AM422939/France) were 2.67%. A1762T/G1764A mutation was observed in 1.96% and 5.36%, whereas T1753V mutation was found in 2.94% and 1.79% of HBV/B and HBV/C, respectively. CONCLUSION: HBV/B and HBV/C are dominant in Makassar, similar to most areas in Indonesia. Mutations in BCP which might be associated with severity of liver disease are less common.","Utama A, Octavia TI, Dhenni R, Miskad UA, Yusuf I, Tai S",Virol J,2009 Aug 19,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
38446812,"Challenges to integrating programs for the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B into antenatal care: Experiences from Indonesia.","The WHO's Asia-Pacific framework for triple elimination recommends that countries evaluate their programs for the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B (EMTCT), including identifying gaps to improve program planning and the implementation of elimination strategies in antenatal care (ANC) services. In 2022, the Indonesian Ministry of Health reported that only 39% of pregnant women were tested for HIV, 14% for syphilis, and 28% for hepatitis B, respectively. We conducted a qualitative study involving a focus group discussion (FGD) and in-depth interviews with 25 key stakeholders in Bali and West Nusa Tenggara Provinces to identify specific challenges to testing for HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B in ANC settings. Thematic analysis was used to identify the themes generated from the data. Health system bottlenecks experienced by stakeholders included supply chain management issues involving stock forecasting and stock monitoring, stock-outs of rapid test reagents which were particularly most frequent and for longer durations for syphilis and hepatitis B, high staff turnover, lack of staff training on how to perform the test, the complexity and time needed to record the data on women's characteristics, risk behaviours, and testing in both paper format and into the computer-based surveillance systems, discrepancies in program coverage data from different divisions of the district health office involved in the reporting system, high levels of stigma that prevented women from being followed up, challenges in notifying partners, and inadequate reporting and referral of women from private providers to public ones for testing. Interventions addressing the above challenges are worthy of consideration to improve the health system function and integrate EMTCT into the ANC settings.","Wulandari LPL, Lubis DS, Kurniati DPY, Sumintang K, Ardrini DAM, Mariani P, Januraga PP, Camellia A, Laksmi NMDP, Mahmudah L, Ong JJ, Causer L, Liverani M, Guy R, Wiseman V",PLOS Glob Public Health,2024,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
24020990,Novel hepatitis B virus strain developing due to recombination between genotypes H and B strains isolated from a Japanese patient.,"AIM: In Japan, genotypes B and C are the predominant genotypes isolated from patients with chronic hepatitis B, while genotype A predominates in patients with acute hepatitis B. Globalization, however, appears to have changed the distribution of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes. Thus, the viral characteristics of HBV genotypes other than genotypes A, B and C were examined. METHODS: Screening of genotypes was performed by enzyme immunoassay and/or polymerase chain reaction INVADER method in 222 patients with HBV. The full-length nucleotide sequences of unusual strains were compared to those in the database, followed by construction of a phylogenetic tree. RESULTS: Unusual HBV strains were isolated from two patients: a 27-year-old Japanese bisexual man with acute hepatitis B with HIV co-infection and a 52-year-old Japanese man with chronic hepatitis B. The former strain was classified as genotype H, showing an overall identity of 99.8% to the Thailand strain (EU498228), while the nucleotide sequence of the latter strain showed similarity to the genotype B strains isolated in Malaysia (JQ027316) and Indonesia (JQ429079) between DR2 and DR1 in the X region, with identities of 96.9%. However, this strain was classified as genotype H by full-length sequence analysis, and the sequence between nt2023 and nt2262 showed no similarity to that in any previously reported strains. CONCLUSION: HBV strains showing recombination between genotype B and H strains were found even in chronic hepatitis patients in Japan. Globalization may yield HBV strains of possible novel genotypes containing novel nucleotide sequences in the precore/core region.","Uchida Y, Kouyama JI, Naiki K, Sugawara K, Inao M, Nakayama N, Mochida S",Hepatol Res,2014 Oct,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
15564741,"Genetic diversity of hepatitis B virus strains derived worldwide: genotypes, subgenotypes, and HBsAg subtypes.","Sequences of 234 complete genomes and 631 hepatitis B surface antigen genes were used to assess the worldwide diversity of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Apart from the described two subgenotypes each for A and F, also B, C, and D divided into four subgenotypes each in the analysis of complete genomes supported by significant bootstrap values. The subgenotypes of B and C differed in their geographical distribution, with B1 dominating in Japan, B2 in China and Vietnam, B3 confined to Indonesia, and B4 confined to Vietnam, all strains specifying subtype ayw1. Subgenotype C1 was common in Japan, Korea, and China; C2 in China, South-East Asia, and Bangladesh, and C3 in the Oceania comprising strains specifying adrq-, and C4 specifying ayw3 is encountered in Aborigines from Australia. This pattern of defined geographical distribution was less evident for D1-D4, where the subgenotypes were widely spread in Europe, Africa, and Asia, possibly due to their divergence having occurred a longer time ago than for genotypes B and C, with D4 being the first split and still the dominating subgenotype of D in the Oceania. The genetic diversity of HBV and the geographical distribution of its subgenotypes provide a tool to reconstruct the evolutionary history of HBV and may help to complement genetic data in the understanding of the evolution and past migrations of man.","Norder H, Courouce AM, Coursaget P, Echevarria JM, Lee SD, Mushahwar IK, Robertson BH, Locarnini S, Magnius LO",Intervirology,2004,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
22451183,Prevalence of hepatic steatosis in chronic hepatitis B patients and its association with disease severity.,"AIM: to know the prevalence of liver steatosis in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients and evaluate whether its presence was associated with a more progressive disease. METHODS: a cross-sectional study was conducted in Cipto Mangunkusumo and Medistra Hospitals, Jakarta on CHB patients between 2007 and 2009. Data on patients' demography, anthropometry, liver function test and hepatitis B serology were collected. Hepatic steatosis was assessed by liver biopsy and graded as mild (<33%), moderate (33-66%) or severe (>66%). Fibrosis stage and necroinflammatory activity were assessed according to the METAVIR system. RESULTS: one-hundred and seventy four patients were enrolled; 99 (56.9%) among them were men. Patients' mean age was 39.9 +/- 10.69 years. About 56% of cases were HBeAg negative. The prevalence of liver steatosis was 29.9%. Patients with liver steatosis had significantly higher body mass index (25.1 +/- 3.3 vs. 22.7 +/- 3.33 kg/m2, p<0.001) and waist circumference (88.3 vs. 79.0 cm; p<0.001). No association between liver steatosis and HBeAg status (p=0.736). There were no differences of log HBV-DNA levels (5.72 +/- 1.993 vs. 6.07 +/- 2.077; p=0.675) and liver stiffness (8.3 +/- 6.28 vs. 9.5 +/- 10.18 kPa) between patients with and without liver steatosis. The presence of significant fibrosis (61.5% vs. 69.7%; p=0.295) and necroinflammation (63.5% vs. 65.6%; p=0.789) was not differed between patients with and without liver steatosis. CONCLUSION: liver steatosis was found in 30% of chronic hepatitis B patients. Its presence was mostly associated with central obesity. Unlike chronic hepatitis C, liver steatosis in chronic hepatitis B was not related to a more progressive disease.","Lesmana LA, Lesmana CR, Pakasi LS, Krisnuhoni E",Acta Med Indones,2012 Jan,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
31952213,PreS1 Mutations Alter the Large HBsAg Antigenicity of a Hepatitis B Virus Strain Isolated in Bangladesh.,"Mutations in the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome can potentially lead to vaccination failure, diagnostic escape, and disease progression. However, there are no reports on viral gene expression and large hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) antigenicity alterations due to mutations in HBV isolated from a Bangladeshi population. Here, we sequenced the full genome of the HBV isolated from a clinically infected patient in Bangladesh. The open reading frames (ORFs) (P, S, C, and X) of the isolated HBV strain were successfully amplified and cloned into a mammalian expression vector. The HBV isolate was identified as genotype C (sub-genotype C2), serotype adr, and evolutionarily related to strains isolated in Indonesia, Malaysia, and China. Clinically significant mutations, such as preS1 C2964A, reverse transcriptase domain I91L, and small HBsAg N3S, were identified. The viral P, S, C, and X genes were expressed in HEK-293T and HepG2 cells by transient transfection with a native subcellular distribution pattern analyzed by immunofluorescence assay. Western blotting of large HBsAg using preS1 antibody showed no staining, and preS1 ELISA showed a significant reduction in reactivity due to amino acid mutations. This mutated preS1 sequence has been identified in several Asian countries. To our knowledge, this is the first report investigating changes in large HBsAg antigenicity due to preS1 mutations.","Hossain MG, Mahmud MM, Nazir KHMNH, Ueda K",Int J Mol Sci,2020 Jan 15,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
33133698,"The High Prevalence of Negative Hepatitis B Surface Antibody (Anti-HBs) among Pregnant Women in Bandung, Indonesia: A Community-Based Study.","BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a disease that creates a high global burden by affecting approximately 3.5% of the total world population. The main transmission of this disease is from mother to child (MTCT). HBV vaccination program was already initiated in Indonesia in 1987. However, after three decades, the HBV infection prevalence stays stagnant. This study aimed to explore the seroprevalence of HBV markers and the attributable risk factors of pregnant women at risk of transmitting HBV to their offspring. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted on pregnant women from primary midwifery and obstetric clinics across Bandung, Indonesia, to assess the HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs serological markers. Questionnaire-based interviews were used to obtain the sociodemographic determinants. Logistic regression was applied to assess the association of each determinant factor to positive HBsAg or negative anti-HBs as a dependent variable, which was then reported as odds ratios (OR). RESULTS: A total of 196 subjects were recruited with 12/196 (6.1%) of them were positive HBsAg. After exclusions of those with positive HBsAg and anti-HBc, 24/175 (13.7%) women were isolated as positive anti-HBs, leaving 151/175 (86.3%) women with negative anti-HBs who were susceptible to HBV infection. Low body mass index (BMI) less than 18.5 kg/m(2) was a risk factor for positive HBsAg with OR = 5.850 (95% CI 1.466-23.34), p = 0.012. Nevertheless, no significant determinant factor was associated with negative anti-HBs. CONCLUSION: Most pregnant women in Bandung, Indonesia, are susceptible to HBV infection, as marked by the negative anti-HBs status.","Girawan D, Judistiani RTD, Risan NA, Bestari MB, Nugraha ES, Ermaya YS, Prasetyo D",Int J Hepatol,2020,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
38140670,Cellular Release of Infectious Hepatitis C Virus Particles via Endosomal Pathways.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that causes chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The release of infectious HCV particles from infected hepatocytes is a crucial step in viral dissemination and disease progression. While the exact mechanisms of HCV particle release remain poorly understood, emerging evidence suggests that HCV utilizes intracellular membrane trafficking and secretory pathways. These pathways include the Golgi secretory pathway and the endosomal trafficking pathways, such as the recycling endosome pathway and the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-dependent multivesicular bodies (MVBs) pathway. This review provides an overview of recent advances in understanding the release of infectious HCV particles, with a particular focus on the involvement of the host cell factors that participate in HCV particle release. By summarizing the current knowledge in this area, this review aims to contribute to a better understanding of endosomal pathways involved in the extracellular release of HCV particles and the development of novel antiviral strategies.","Deng L, Solichin MR, Adyaksa DNM, Septianastiti MA, Fitri RA, Suwardan GNR, Matsui C, Abe T, Shoji I",Viruses,2023 Dec 14,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
23336976,High prevalence of hepatitis B virus genotype C/C1 in the Minangkabau ethnic group in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: The Minangkabau is one of the major ethnic groups in Indonesia. Previous studies with a limited number of samples have shown a different prevalence of HBV/C in the Minangkabau compared to the Indonesian population in general. The aim of this study was to assess the HBV genotype distribution pattern and the prevalence of pre-S, T1753V and A1762T/G1764A mutations among the Minangkabau HBV carriers. The samples were collected from Padang, West Sumatera and from western Java. Mixed primers for specific genotypes were used to determine the HBV genotype. Pre-S or S genes were amplified, sequenced and aligned with reference sequences from GenBank to derive a phylogenetic tree for subgenotyping. Pre-S genes were also analyzed for mutations. The basal core promoter (BCP) region was amplified and directly sequenced to analyze T1753V and A1762T/G1764A mutations. RESULTS: The predominant HBV genotype among the Minangkabau HBV carriers (n=117) was C (72.6%) followed by B (24.8%) and co-infection with B and C (2.6%). The prevalence of pre-S mutations, including both the pre-S deletion and pre-S2 start codon mutation, was 41.0%, and the T1753V and A1762T/G1764A mutations were found in 51.9% and 71.2% respectively. HBV/C1 was the predominant HBV subgenotype in the Minangkabau HBV carriers, and was found in 66.2%, followed by B3, B7, C8, B2, B9, C2, and C10 (18.3%, 7.0%, 2.8%, 1.4%, 1.4%, 1.4%, and 1.4% respectively). From samples that were found to be co-infected with HBV B and C, two samples were successfully cloned and subgenotyped, including one with mixed subgenotypes of B3 and C1, and another one with mixed subgenotypes of B7, C1, putative intergenotypic of B/A, and C/A. Furthermore, three samples from donors of non-Minangkabau ethnicity from Padang were found to be infected with an intragenotypic recombination form, including a putative recombinant of B8/B3 and B9/B7. CONCLUSION: HBV/C with subgenotype C1 was the predominant HBV genotype among HBV carriers of Minangkabau ethnicity. The prevalence of pre-S, A1762T/G1764A, and T1753V mutations was higher among the Minangkabau compared to Indonesian HBV carriers in general.","Siburian MD, Utama A, Dhenni R, Arnelis N, Fanany I, Intan MD, Kurniasih TS, Andriani F, Afadlal S, Julianto EB, Rasman WS, Zubir N, Mathew G",Virol J,2013 Jan 22,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia

These appear to implicate HLA-DR [rs3135363; P= 6.53 x 10(-22); odds ratio (OR) = 1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.35-1.74]; HLA-DP, previously associated with the risk of chronic hepatitis B infection (rs9277535; P= 2.91 x 10(-12); OR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.63-0.81); and a gene rich HLA Class III interval (rs9267665; P = 1.24 x 10(-17); OR = 2.05, CI = 1.64-2.57). The substantial overlap of these variants and those identified by GWAS of chronic hepatitis B infection confirms vaccine response as a model for infection, while suggesting that the vaccine is least effective in those most at risk of lifelong infection, following exposure to the virus.","Png E, Thalamuthu A, Ong RT, Snippe H, Boland GJ, Seielstad M",Hum Mol Genet,2011 Oct 1,Hepatitis A OR Hepatitis B AND Indonesia
34586032,Facilitators and barriers for the delivery and uptake of cervical cancer screening in Indonesia: a scoping review.,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer (CC) is the second most common female cancer. In Indonesia, national CC screening coverage is low at 12%, highlighting the need to investigate facilitators and barriers to screening. OBJECTIVE: This review synthesises research on facilitators and barriers to the delivery and uptake of CC screening; analyses them in terms of supply- and demand-side factors and their interconnectedness; and proposes recommendations for further research. METHODS: Medline Ovid, CINAHL, Global Health, Neliti, SINTA and Google Scholar were searched, applying a search string with keywords relevant to screening, CC and Indonesia. In total 34 records were included, all were publications on CC screening in Indonesia (2000-2020) in English or Indonesian. Records were analysed to identify findings relevant to the categories of barriers and facilitators, supply-and demand-side factors. RESULTS: Demand-side facilitators identified included:  husband, family or social/peer support (14 studies); information availability, knowledge and awareness (12 studies); positive attitudes and strong perception of screening benefit and the seriousness of CC (12 studies); higher education and socioeconomic status (11 studies); having health insurance; and short distance to screening services (4 studies). Evidence on supply-side was limited. Supply-side facilitators included counselling and support (6 studies), and ease of access (6 studies). Demand-side barriers identified focused on: lack of knowledge/awareness and lack of confidence in screening (14 studies); fear, fatalism and shame (10 studies); time and transportation constraints (8 studies); and lack of husband approval and support (6 studies). Supply-side barriers included: lack of skilled screening providers (3 studies); lack of advocacy and health promotion (3 studies); resource constraints (3 studies); and lack of supervision and support for health care providers (3 studies). CONCLUSIONS: Facilitators and barriers were mirrored in the supply- and demand-side findings. The geographical scope and population diversity of existing research is limited and further supply-side research is urgently needed.","Robbers GML, Bennett LR, Spagnoletti BRM, Wilopo SA",Glob Health Action,2021 Jan 1,Cancer AND Indonesia
37576162,Cancer Incidence and Mortality in a Tertiary Hospital in Indonesia: An 18-Year Data Review.,"BACKGROUND: Every population, regardless of wealth or social development, faces the major health issue of cancer. Cancer incidence and mortality differ by region and period. Thus, this study aimed to determine the characteristics, incidence, and mortality of various cancers at Dr. Wahidin Sudirohusodo Hospital, a referral center hospital in Makassar, Indonesia. METHODS: This study employed a descriptive research design using secondary data recorded at Dr. Wahidin Sudirohusodo Hospital in Makassar, Indonesia, between January 2002 and December 2019. RESULTS: We classified the 7824 cancer patients in our study into solid and non-solid cancer groups. The incidence of solid cancer (79.3%) was higher than that of non-solid cancer (20.7%), causing 1063 deaths, or 61.7%, of all cancer-related deaths. There were 6083 (77.7%) cases of cancer survival. The cancers with the highest incidence were breast cancer (1008 cases [12.9%]), leukemia (683 cases [8.7%]), and cervical cancer (631 cases [8.1%]). Breast, cervical, and ovarian cancers were the most frequent cancers in female patients. Leukemia was the most frequent cancer in male patients, followed by colorectal and liver cancers. CONCLUSIONS: A region-based statistical record of cancer incidence and mortality is vital and useful to prioritizing cancer treatment at a given time.","Prihantono, Rusli R, Christeven R, Faruk M",Ethiop J Health Sci,2023 May,Cancer AND Indonesia
34443572,"Current Status, Distribution, and Future Directions of Natural Products against Colorectal Cancer in Indonesia: A Systematic Review.","In 2020, an estimated 19.3 million new cancer cases and nearly 10 million cancer deaths have occurred worldwide, with colorectal cancer ranking as the third most frequently diagnosed (10.0%). Several attempts have been conducted against cancer, including surgery, radiation, monoclonal antibodies, and chemotherapy. Many people choose natural products as alternatives against cancer. These products will not only help in human life preservation but also work as a source of up-to-date information, leading people away from incorrect information. We discuss the current status, distribution, and future implications of protecting populations with natural products as an alternative against colorectal cancer in Indonesia. Thirty-eight studies were included in this review for data extraction. The distribution of natural products in Indonesia that have potential activity against colorectal cancer cells was predominated by terpenoids, followed by phytosterols, phenolics, alkaloids, and polyisoprenoids. The type of cell line utilized in the cytotoxic activity analysis of natural products was the WiDr cell line, followed by HT-29 cells and HCT-116 cells. This review showed that MTT in vitro assay is a general method used to analyze the cytotoxic activity of a natural product against colorectal cancer cells, followed by other in vitro and in vivo methods. The systematic review provided predictions for several secondary metabolites to be utilized as an alternative treatment against colorectal cancer in Indonesia. It also might be a candidate for a future co-chemotherapy agent in safety, quality, and standardization. In addition, computational methods are being developed to predict the drug-likeness of compounds, thus, drug discovery is already on the road towards electronic research and development.","Illian DN, Hafiz I, Meila O, Utomo ARH, Nuryawan A, Siregar GA, Basyuni M",Molecules,2021 Aug 17,Cancer AND Indonesia
34702111,Mapping and Visualization of Cancer Research in Indonesia: A Scientometric Analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: The incidence of cancer and its prevalence are increasing in Indonesia. It is crucial to ensure national cancer policies are evidence-based and promote research. While cancer research is being conducted across Indonesia, the extent and focus of research activities are not known, with no existing synthesis of the cancer research landscape. We seek to address this gap by characterising trends in the extent and types of cancer research conducted in Indonesia. METHODS: Scientometric study using descriptive analyses to determine annual growth patterns in publications across all cancer research literature from Indonesia. We developed a classification system for both research type and study design which was applied to all included publications. A visualisation software tool (VOSviewer) was used to explore the geographical distribution of research activity. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to determine the influence of international collaboration on the impact factor of journals in which articles were published. RESULTS: We retrieved 1773 cancer-related articles published by Indonesia-affiliated authors from 1961 to 2020, with notable year-on-year increases in the annual total number of published articles since 2015. Most articles (84.0%) were published by authors affiliated with institutions on Java Island. The most commonly published article type was basic research and discovery science (28.8%), using a one-group analytical study design (28.8%). International collaboration was significantly correlated with a higher h-index of the journal in which research was published (P < .0001, r = .317). CONCLUSION: An increase in the number and range of topics explored in cancer-related publications over time was identified. The summary of the current corpus of cancer-related research for Indonesia can be used to direct the development of the national cancer control plan alongside informing the national cancer research strategy. Our novel and feasible scientometric approach can be used to direct future national and regional mapping of cancer research.","Puspitaningtyas H, Espressivo A, Hutajulu SH, Fuad A, Allsop MJ",Cancer Control,2021 Jan-Dec,Cancer AND Indonesia
37116129,Risk Factors Associated with Nasopharyngeal Cancer Incidences in Indonesia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk factors associated the incidence of NPC, particularly in Indonesia. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted according to PRISMA statement. Database including PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, Web of Science, and GARUDA were retrieved. Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the quality of published study and analyse the risk of bias of included study. Random-effect model and reported pooled Odds Ratio (OR) with 95%CI was carried out in our meta-analysis. RESULTS: A pooled of 7 studies were included in our study which included 764 participants. We found that female gender was not associated with the incidences of NPC (OR 1.45, 95% CI: 0.61-3.45, p=0.40), and smoking was highly increased the incidence of NPC (OR 4.39 95% CI (0.79-24.40), but not statistically significant (p=0.09). Furthermore, salted fish consumption and some HLA alleles were associated with increased risk. CONCLUSION: The incidence of NPC is not associated with female gender nor smoking habits. However, the risk of NPC is higher for those who consume salted fish and have some susceptible HLA alleles. Further investigations in larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.","Romdhoni AC, Rejeki PS, Guo HR, Milla C, Melbiarta RR, Visuddho V, Nugraha D",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2023 Apr 1,Cancer AND Indonesia
35345354,Twelve Years Implementation of Cervical and Breast Cancer Screening Program in Indonesia.,"OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to measure achievement of the national program of cervical and breast cancer screening in Indonesia after 12 years implementation and factors associated with the number of the screening. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study with descriptive and analytic analysis. Secondary data was collected from Directorate of Non Communicable Disease Control, Ministry of Health. RESULTS: From 2007 to 2018, the program was implemented in all 34 provinces, at 51% primary health centers (PHC) with 3 providers each. Total women aged 30-50 years screened was 3,664,625 (9.8% of the target). The number rose gradually from 2007 to 2014, with significant increase from 2015 to 2018. Bali province had the highest coverage (31%) and Papua had the lowest (1%). We found a wide disparity of coverage among provinces. There was 3.4% of VIA-positive, 16.1% was treated with cryotherapy, 1.3 per 1,000 of suspected cervical cancer, 5,4% lump in the breast, and 0.7 per 1,000 suspected breast cancer. Factors associated with number of the screening were number of PHC providing screening, number of GP, total provider, number of NCD post, number of Village with NCD Post, and income of the province. CONCLUSION: The cervical and breast cancer screening program was running in all provinces in more than half of primary health centers in Indonesia. National coverage (9.8%) was far below the target and varied widely among provinces. Number of PHC with screening services, number of GP, number of total provider, number of NCD post, number of Village with NCD Post, and income of the province have association with cervical and breast cancer screening.","Wahidin M, Febrianti R, Susanty F, Hasanah SR",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2022 Mar 1,Cancer AND Indonesia
33505867,Excess Risk of Lung Cancer Among Agriculture and Construction Workers in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: In Indonesia, many occupations and industries involve a variety of hazardous and toxic materials. The ILO estimates that about 21.1% of the tracheal, bronchial, and lung cancer deaths among men were attributable to workplace hazardous substances. This study investigated the relationship between occupations or workplace exposure and the risk of lung cancer in the country. The results will help determine how Indonesia can best mitigate the risk for its workers. OBJECTIVES: This case-control study utilizes the Indonesian Standard of Industrial Classification (IndSIC) 2015 with the aim of exploring the risk of lung cancer among Indonesian workers. METHODS: The study included patients aged 35 years old or older receiving thoracic CT at the radiology department of Persahabatan Hospital. The cases were histological-confirmed primary lung cancers, while the controls were negative thoracic CT scan for lung cancer. The subjects' job titles and industries were classified according to IndSIC 2015 and blind to the patient's grouping as a case or control. Logistic regression was used to determine the odds ratios for lung cancer among all sections and some divisions or groups of IndSIC 2015. FINDINGS: The mean age was 58.1 (+/-10.23) years for lung cancer patients and 54.5 (+/-10.23) years for controls. The majority of subjects (19.6%) worked in Section G (Wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycle). After adjusting for age, gender, level of education, and smoking habit, the risk of lung cancer was nearly three-times higher (OR = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.11-7.02) in workers of Division A01 (crop, animal production, and hunting) and two-times higher (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.05-3.46) in workers of Section F (construction) compared to the workers in other sections or divisions. CONCLUSIONS: The excess risk of lung cancer among certain categories of workers confirms the need for improved policy, monitoring, and control of occupational exposure for primary cancer prevention and workers' compensation purposes.","Suraya A, Nowak D, Sulistomo AW, Icksan AG, Berger U, Syahruddin E, Bose-O'Reilly S",Ann Glob Health,2021 Jan 6,Cancer AND Indonesia
26085688,Urologic cancer in Indonesia.,"Non-communicable diseases, including cancer, start to become more common in Indonesia. According to the government statement, incidence of malignant diseases increased annually up to 8% in the last decade and these diseases become the seventh leading cause of death in Indonesia. On the basis of the latest Globocan report on cancer incidence in Indonesia, prostate cancer ranks sixth; followed by bladder (12th) and kidney (18th). More than half of patients with kidney cancer are diagnosed in the advanced stage. Besides renal cell carcinoma, there are significant number of people affected with squamous cell and transitional cell carcinoma because of kidney stones. Radical nephrectomy or cytoreductive nephrectomy was the primary treatment, mostly done as an open procedure. Transitional cell carcinoma is the commonest histology type in bladder cancer cases followed by squamous cell carcinoma, which almost always related to bladder stones. Unfortunately, >70% of our cases were diagnosed with muscle invasive bladder cancer, and  approximately 60% of these patients refused further radical treatment. Incidence of prostate cancer is increasing rapidly and it becomes the third most common cancer in men. However, most of our patients are diagnosed in the advanced stage. Radical prostatectomy or external beam radiotherapy is the treatment of choice in localized disease. Nearly 40% of the elderly patients are treated with primary androgen deprivation therapy. Therefore, it requires more research by the Indonesian urologists and other healthcare providers to diagnose these cancers in earlier stage as well as community education for prevention.","Umbas R, Safriadi F, Mochtar CA, Djatisoesanto W, Hamid AR",Jpn J Clin Oncol,2015 Aug,Cancer AND Indonesia
36414948,Advance care planning for patients with cancer and family caregivers in Indonesia: a qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: Individuals' willingness to engage in advance care planning is influenced by factors such as culture and religious beliefs. While most studies on advance care planning in Asia have been performed in high-income countries, Indonesia is a lower-middle-income country, with a majority of strongly collectivist and religiously devout inhabitants. We studied the perspectives of Indonesian patients with cancer and family caregivers regarding advance care planning by first exploring their experiences with medical information-disclosure, decision-making, and advance care planning and how these experiences influence their perspectives on advance care planning. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews among 16 patients with cancer and 15 family caregivers in a national cancer center in Jakarta and a tertiary academic general hospital in Yogyakarta. We performed an inductive thematic analysis using open, axial, and selective coding. The rigor of the study was enhanced by reflective journaling, dual coding, and investigator triangulation. RESULTS: Twenty-six of 31 participants were younger than 60 years old, 20 were Muslim and Javanese, and 17 were college or university graduates. Four major themes emerged as important in advance care planning: (1) participants' perceptions on the importance or harmfulness of cancer-related information, (2) the importance of communicating bad news sensitively (through empathetic, implicit, and mediated communication), (3) participants' motives for participating in medical decision-making (decision-making seen as patients' right or responsibility, or patients' state of dependency on others), and (4) the complexities of future planning (e.g., due to its irrelevance to participants' religious beliefs and/or their difficulties in seeing the relevance of future planning). CONCLUSIONS: Culturally sensitive approaches to advance care planning in Indonesia should address the importance of facilitating open communication between patients and their families, and the various perspectives on information provision, bad news communication, and decision-making. Advance care planning should focus on the exploration of patients' values, rather than drafting treatment plans in advance.","Martina D, Kustanti CY, Dewantari R, Sutandyo N, Putranto R, Shatri H, Effendy C, van der Heide A, van der Rijt CCD, Rietjens JAC",BMC Palliat Care,2022 Nov 22,Cancer AND Indonesia
36636790,"Type of cancer and complementary and alternative medicine are determinant factors for the patient delay experienced by children with cancer: A study in West Java, Indonesia.","INTRODUCTION: Most pediatric cancer patients in developing countries present at an advanced stage due to delayed diagnosis, being an important barrier to effective care. The objective of this study was to evaluate the associated factor of patient delay and explore significant parental practice-associated risk factor to patient delay. METHODS: This was a sequential mixed methodology, utilizing data from the Indonesian Pediatric Cancer Registry for clinical variables and completed interviews with parents using structured questionnaires to obtain their sociodemographic data. A binary logistic regression analysis model was fitted to identify factors associated with patient delay. Additional semi-structured interviews related to parental practice of using complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) were administered to 30 parents. Thematic framework analysis was performed on qualitative data to explore determinant factors of parental practice of using CAM. RESULTS: We interviewed 356 parents with children with cancer. The median patient delay was 14 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 6-46.5 days). The most extended delay was in patients with malignant bone tumors (median 66, IQR: 14-126). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, solid cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 5.22, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.79-9.77, p < .001) and use of CAM (OR = 1.86, 95% CI: 1.13-3.08, p = .015) were associated with patient delay. Qualitative interviews highlighted key issues relative to determinant parental factors using CAM, including vague initial childhood cancer symptoms, parental health-seeking behavior, CAM availability and accessibility, also barriers of healthcare facilities. CONCLUSION: Type of cancer and use of CAM are essential factors that cause patient delay. It should be addressed in the future childhood cancer awareness and childhood cancer diagnosis pathway.","Sari NM, Devansyah S, Modjaningrat I, Suryawan N, Susanah S, Rakhmillah L, Wahyudi K, Kaspers GJL",Pediatr Blood Cancer,2023 Apr,Cancer AND Indonesia
37246534,"Temporal and spatial analyses of colorectal cancer incidence in Yogyakarta, Indonesia: a cross-sectional study.","We aimed to explore the district-level temporal dynamics and sub-district level geographical variations of colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence in the Special Region of Yogyakarta Province. We performed a cross-sectional study using data from the Yogyakarta population-based cancer registry (PBCR) comprised of 1,593 CRC cases diagnosed in 2008-2019. The age-standardized rates (ASRs) were determined using 2014 population data. The temporal trend and geographical distribution of cases were analysed using joinpoint regression and Moran's I statistics. During 2008-2019, CRC incidence increased by 13.44% annually. Joinpoints were identified in 2014 and 2017, which were also the periods when annual percentage change (APC) was the highest throughout the observation periods (18.84). Significant APC changes were observed in all districts, with the highest in Kota Yogyakarta (15.57). The ASR of CRC incidence per 100,000 person- years was 7.03 in Sleman, 9.20 in Kota Yogyakarta, and 7.07 in Bantul district. We found a regional variation of CRC ASR with a concentrated pattern of hotspots in the central sub-districts of the catchment areas and a significant positive spatial autocorrelation of CRC incidence rates in the province (I=0.581, p<0.001). The analysis identified four high-high clusters sub-districts in the central catchment areas. This is the first Indonesian study reported from PBCR data, showing an increased annual CRC incidence during an extensive observation period in the Yogyakarta region. A heterogeneous distribution map of CRC incidence is included. These findings may serve as basis for CRC screening implementation and healthcare services improvement.","Wiranata JA, Puspitaningtyas H, Hutajulu SH, Fachiroh J, Anggorowati N, Sanjaya GY, Lazuardi L, Sripan P",Geospat Health,2023 May 25,Cancer AND Indonesia
32742032,"Sales of anti-cancer medicines; China, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand.","OBJECTIVE: To assess sales of anti-cancer medicines in the 2017 World Health Organization's WHO Model list of essential medicines in China, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand from 2007 (2008 for Kazakhstan and Malaysia) to 2017. METHODS: We extracted sales volume data for 39 anti-cancer medicines from the IQVIA database. We divided the total quantity sold by the reference defined daily dose to estimate the total number of defined daily doses sold, per country per year, for three types of anti-cancer therapies (traditional chemotherapy, targeted therapy and endocrine therapy). We adjusted these data by the number of new cancer cases in each country for each year. FINDINGS: We observed an increase in sales across all types of anti-cancer therapies in all countries. The largest number of defined daily doses of traditional chemotherapy per new cancer case was sold in Thailand; however, the largest relative increase per new cancer case occurred in Indonesia (9.48-fold). The largest absolute and relative increases in sales of defined daily doses of targeted therapies per new cancer case occurred in Kazakhstan. Malaysia sold the largest number of adjusted defined daily doses of endocrine therapies in 2017, while China and Indonesia more than doubled their adjusted sales volumes between 2007 and 2017. CONCLUSION: The use of sales data can fill an important knowledge gap in the use of anti-cancer medicines, particularly during periods of insurance coverage expansion. Combined with other data, sales volume data can help to monitor efforts to improve equitable access to essential medicines.","Ferrario A, Stephens P, Guan X, Ross-Degnan D, Wagner A",Bull World Health Organ,2020 Jul 1,Cancer AND Indonesia
35025941,"Delays in the presentation and diagnosis of women with breast cancer in Yogyakarta, Indonesia: A retrospective observational study.","PURPOSE: To investigate factors associated with delays in presentation and diagnosis of women with confirmed breast cancer (BC). METHODS: A cross-sectional study nested in an ongoing prospective cohort study of breast cancer patients at Dr Sardjito Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia, was employed. Participants (n = 150) from the main study were recruited, with secondary information on demographic, clinical, and tumor variables collected from the study database. A questionnaire was used to gather data on other socioeconomic variables, herbal consumption, number of healthcare visits, knowledge-attitude-practice of BC, and open-ended questions relating to initial presentation. Presentation delay (time between initial symptom and first consultation) was defined as >/=3 months. Diagnosis delay was defined as >/=1 month between presentation and diagnosis confirmation. Impact on disease stage and determinants of both delays were examined. A Kruskal-Wallis test was used to assess the length and distribution of delays by disease stage. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to explore the association between delays, cancer stage and factors. RESULTS: Sixty-five (43.3%) patients had a >/=3-month presentation delay and 97 (64.7%) had a diagnosis confirmation by >/=1 month. Both presentation and diagnosis delays increased the risk of being diagnosed with cancer stage III-IV (odds ratio/OR 2.21, 95% CI 0.97-5.01, p = 0.059 and OR 3.03, 95% CI 1.28-7.19, p = 0.012). Visit to providers </=3 times was significantly attributed to a reduced diagnosis delay (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.06-0.37, p <0.001), while having a family history of cancer was significantly associated with increased diagnosis delay (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.03-5.04, p = 0.042). The most frequent reasons for delaying presentation were lack of awareness of the cause of symptoms (41.5%), low perceived severity (27.7%) and fear of surgery intervention (26.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of BC patients in our setting had a delay in presentation and 64.7% experienced a delay in diagnosis. These delays increased the likelihood of presentation with a more advanced stage of disease. Future research is required in Indonesia to explore the feasibility of evidence-based approaches to reducing delays at both levels, including educational interventions to increase awareness of BC symptoms and reducing existing complex and convoluted referral pathways for patients suspected of having cancer.","Hutajulu SH, Prabandari YS, Bintoro BS, Wiranata JA, Widiastuti M, Suryani ND, Saptari RG, Taroeno-Hariadi KW, Kurnianda J, Purwanto I, Hardianti MS, Allsop MJ",PLoS One,2022,Cancer AND Indonesia
36908296,"Quality of Life of Cancer Patients during Chemotherapy in Indonesia: A Comparison of EORTC QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D-5L, Based on Patients' Characteristics.","One of the important outcomes to define the success of cancer treatment is the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) that can be measured using generic and/or specific instruments. Our study aims to define the cancer patients' HRQoL in some hospitals in Indonesia as measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment for Cancer (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the EQ-5D-5L, to define the differences of cancer patients' HRQoL referring to patients' characteristics, and to explore determinants of cancer patients' HRQoL. We recruited 451 cancer patients using a cross-sectional design in two referral hospitals in Central Java, Indonesia, using the purposive sampling technique. All subjects, recruited from July 2020 to October 2021, met the inclusion criteria, namely, adult patients diagnosed with cancers in all stages who willingly participated in the study. The Indonesian value set was used to obtain the EQ-5D-5L index score. We further analyzed the data based on cancer stages and compared two questionnaires using independent t test. We highlighted that most of the cancer patients are female (69.4%), young (86%), and at advanced stages of cancer (54.1%). The physical and role functions and global health status of the cancer patients are poor, and the most severe symptom is fatigue. Moreover, most of them experience severe pain and perform daily activities with difficulties. Some patients' characteristics show significant influences on the HRQoL domains in both questionnaires (p < 0.05). Interestingly, both of the questionnaires have shown significant correlations between similar domains and revealed the poor HRQoL of advanced cancer patients (p < 0.05). Our study finds that cancer patients still have poor HRQoL in some domains. We suggest to the health providers that they apply education and psychological intervention to increase their HRQoL.","Perwitasari DA, Purba FD, Candradewi SF, Dania H, Muhammad Irham L, Noor Faridah I, Septiantoro BP",Int J Clin Pract,2023,Cancer AND Indonesia
38350928,Analyzing socio-environmental determinants of bone and soft tissue cancer in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: This study is designed to explore the potential impact of individual and environmental residential factors as risk determinants for bone and soft tissue cancers, with a particular focus on the Indonesian context. While it is widely recognized that our living environment can significantly influence cancer development, there has been a notable scarcity of research into how specific living environment characteristics relate to the risk of bone and soft tissue cancers. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we analyzed the medical records of oncology patients treated at Prof. Suharso National Referral Orthopedic Hospital. The study aimed to assess tumor malignancy levels and explore the relationships with socio-environmental variables, including gender, distance from the sea, sunrise time, altitude, and population density. Data were gathered in 2020 from diverse sources, including medical records, Google Earth, and local statistical centers. The statistical analyses employed Chi-square and logistic regression techniques with the support of Predictive Analytics SoftWare (PASW) Statistics 18. RESULTS: Both bivariate and multivariate analyses revealed two significant factors associated with the occurrence of bone and soft tissue cancer. Age exhibited a statistically significant influence (OR of 5.345 and a p-value of 0.000 < 0.05), indicating a robust connection between cancer development and age. Additionally, residing within a distance of less than 14 km from the sea significantly affected the likelihood of bone and soft tissue cancers OR 5.604 and p-value (0.001 < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The study underscores the strong association between age and the development of these cancers, emphasizing the need for heightened vigilance and screening measures in older populations. Moreover, proximity to the sea emerges as another noteworthy factor influencing cancer risk, suggesting potential environmental factors at play. These results highlight the multifaceted nature of cancer causation and underscore the importance of considering socio-environmental variables when assessing cancer risk factors. Such insights can inform more targeted prevention and early detection strategies, ultimately contributing to improved cancer management and patient outcomes.","Romadhon YA, Kurniati YP, Jumadi J, Alesheikh AA, Lotfata A",BMC Cancer,2024 Feb 14,Cancer AND Indonesia

Little is known about the spatial and temporal patterns of breast cancer incidence in Indonesia. This study aimed to analyze temporal and spatial variations of breast cancer incidence in Yogyakarta Province, Indonesia. METHODS: The study used breast cancer case data from the Yogyakarta Population-Based Cancer Registry (PBCR) from 2008 to 2019. The catchment areas of the PBCR included the 48 subdistricts of 3 districts (Sleman, Yogyakarta City, and Bantul). Age-standardized incidence rates (ASR) were calculated for each subdistrict. Joinpoint regression was used to detect any significant changes in trends over time. Global Moran's and Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) analyses were performed to identify any spatial clusters or outliers. RESULTS: The subdistricts had a median ASR of 41.9, with a range of 15.3-70.4. The majority of cases were diagnosed at a late stage, with Yogyakarta City having the highest proportion of diagnoses at stage 4. The study observed a significant increasing trend in breast cancer incidence over the study period the fastest of which is in Yogyakarta City with an average annual percentage change of 18.77%, with Sleman having an 18.21% and Bantul having 8.94% average changes each year (p <0.05). We also found a significant positive spatial autocorrelation of breast cancer incidence rates in the province (I = 0.581, p <0.001). LISA analysis identified 11 subdistricts which were high-high clusters in the central area of Yogyakarta City and six low-low clusters in the southeast region of the catchment area in the Bantul and Sleman Districts. No spatial outliers were identified. CONCLUSIONS: We found significant spatial clustering of BC ASR in the Yogyakarta Province, and there was a trend of increasing ASR across the region. These findings can inform resource allocation for public health efforts to high-risk areas and develop targeted prevention and early detection strategies. Further res is needed to understand the factors driving the observed temporal and spatial patterns of breast cancer incidence in Yogyakarta Province, Indonesia.","Ng B, Puspitaningtyas H, Wiranata JA, Hutajulu SH, Widodo I, Anggorowati N, Sanjaya GY, Lazuardi L, Sripan P",PLoS One,2023,Cancer AND Indonesia
33612266,"Knowledge and Practice Regarding Oral Cancer: A Study Among Dentists in Jakarta, Indonesia.","OBJECTIVE: To assess Indonesian dentists' knowledge of risk factors and diagnostic procedures related to oral cancer (OC) and to determine the factors that influenced their level of knowledge. METHODS: A modified version of a questionnaire that had been used to assess dentists' knowledge regarding OC in Canada was used. A total of 816 dentists were invited to participate in the study. RESULTS: The total response rate was 49.2%; however, the number of dentists from 5 regions in Jakarta were equally represented. Use of tobacco or alcohol and history of previous OC were the top 3 risk factors that were answered correctly by dentists, but there was a high proportion of dentists who considered some without any evidence as risk factors. Almost half of the dentists did not know the early signs of OC and that erythroplakia and leukoplakia were associated with increased risks of developing OC. Only about 27% of dentists had a high level of knowledge of risk factors and fewer dentists demonstrated a good knowledge of diagnostic procedures. Dentists' age group, year of graduation, and experience of continuing education significantly influenced the level of knowledge of diagnostic procedures (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Dentists in Jakarta had a considerable level of knowledge of major risk factors of OC, although some gaps in their knowledge, especially in diagnostic procedures, were present. Increasing these competencies may aid in the prevention and early detection of OC.","Wimardhani YS, Warnakulasuriya S, Wardhany II, Syahzaman S, Agustina Y, Maharani DA",Int Dent J,2021 Aug,Cancer AND Indonesia

However, this discrepancy has not been widely explored in the local population. This study aimed to investigate the site-specific likelihood of colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence in the Yogyakarta province, Indonesia. METHODS: This cross-sectional study analyses 1,295 CRC cases diagnosed in 2008-2019 registered in the Yogyakarta population-based cancer registry (PBCR) database. Cases were grouped into colon and rectal cancer. Log-binomial regression was used to determine the relative risk of either colon or rectal cancer across different gender, age group, and rurality of residence. The age-specific rates were calculated by age group and temporal trend for each group were analyzed using joinpoint regression. RESULTS: Females displayed higher odds of colon cancer (relative risk/RR = 1.20, 95%CI = 1.02-1.41) and lower odds of rectal cancer (RR = 0.92, 95%CI = 0.85-0.99). Elevated odds of colon cancer were observed in younger age group, especially 30-39 (RR = 1.87, 95%CI = 1.10-3.19), while decreased odds of rectal cancer was apparent in age group 30-39 and 40-49 (RR = 0.75, 95%CI = 0.60-0.93 and RR = 0.82, 95%CI = 0.69-0.98, respectively). Living in urban or rural areas did not significantly influence the odds of either having colon (RR = 0.98, 95%CI = 0.82-1.17) or rectal cancer (RR = 1.01, 95%CI = 0.93-1.10). During 2008-2019, trends of colon cancer in age <50 increased by 8.15% annually while rectal cancer displayed a 9.71% increase annually prior to 2017, followed by a 17.23% decrease until 2019.

Several oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes have been identified and have different roles related to survival rates in lung cancer patients. This study aims to determine the role of KRAS, EGFR, and TP53 mutations in the survival rate of lung cancer patients in the population of North Sumatra. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study involving 108 subjects diagnosed with lung cancer from histopathology specimens. DNA extractions were performed using FFPE followed by PCR examinations for assessing the expressions of EGFR, RAS, and TP53 protein. Sequencing analysis was carried out to determine the mutations of EGFR exon 19 and 21, RAS protein exon 2, and TP53 exon 5-6 and 8-9. Data input and analysis were conducted using statistical analysis software for Windows. The survival rate analysis was presented with Kaplan Meier. Results: 52 subjects completed all procedures in this study. Most of the subjects are male (75%), above 60 years old (53.8%), heavy smokers (75%), and suffer from adenocarcinoma type of lung cancer (69.2%). No subjects showed KRAS exon 2 mutations. Overall survival rates increased in patients with EGFR mutations (15 months compared to 8 months; p=0.001) and decreased in patients with TP53 mutations (7 months compared to 9 months; p=0.148). Also, there was increasing Progression-Free Survival in patients with EGFR mutations (6 months compared to 3 months) ( p=0.19) and decreasing PFS in patients with TP53 mutations (3 months compared to 6 months) ( p=0.07). Conclusions: There were no KRAS mutations in this study. EGFR mutations showed a higher survival rate, while TP53 mutations showed a lower survival rate in overall survival and progression-free survival.","Soeroso NN, Ananda FR, Sitanggang JS, Vinolina NS",F1000Res,2022,Cancer AND Indonesia
35534085,Planning human resources and facilities to achieve Sustainable Development Goals: a decision-analytical modelling approach to predict cancer control requirements in Indonesia.,"OBJECTIVES: Indonesia aims to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 3 target 4, which focuses on cancer control, by 2030. This study aimed to forecast the human resources for health (HRH) and facilities required for cancer control in Indonesia over an 11-year period to support these goals. DESIGN: A two-stage Markov model was developed to forecast the demand side of facilities and HRH requirements for cancer control in Indonesia over an 11-year period. SETTING: Data sources used include the Indonesia Health Profile Report (2019), the Indonesian Radiation Oncology Society Database and National Cancer Control Committee documents (2019). METHODS: The study involved modelling the current availability of HRH and healthcare facilities in Indonesia and predicting future requirements. The gap between the current and the required HRH and facilities related to oncology, and the costs associated with meeting these requirements, were analysed. RESULTS: Results indicate the need to increase the number of healthcare facilities and HRH to achieve SDG targets. However, UHC for cancer care still may not be achieved, as eastern Indonesia is predicted to have no tertiary hospital until 2030. The forecast shows that Indonesia had a median of only 39% of the HRH requirements in 2019. Closing the HRH gap requires around a 47.6% increase in salary expenditure. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the application of decision-analytical modelling approach to planning HRH and facilities in the context of a low-to-middle-income country. Scaling up oncology services in Indonesia to attain the SDG targets will require expansion of the number and capability of healthcare facilities and HRH. This work allows an in-depth understanding of the resources needed to achieve UHC and SDGs and could be utilised in other disease areas and contexts.","Melyda, Gondhowiardjo S, Jackson LJ, Oppong R",BMJ Open,2022 May 9,Cancer AND Indonesia
28095125,"Nitrate in drinking water and risk of colorectal cancer in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.","Nitrate concentration in well water in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, and its surroundings tended to increase rapidly from time to time, and it may be associated with an elevated risk for several types of cancer. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between nitrate in drinking water and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk occurrence. A case-control study was conducted in Yogyakarta Special Province. Pathologically confirmed 75 CRC patients and 75 controls were consulted and their individual well water was sampled and examined for nitrate concentrations. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to establish the association between nitrate and CRC risk development. There was a significant correlation between nitrate in drinking water and CRC occurrence, and this value was relatively stable after being adjusted for protein intake, smoking history, age, and family history of cancer. These findings demonstrated that the risk of CRC development was fourfold among those with >10 years of nitrate exposure from well water compared with those with </=10 years of nitrate exposure. Consequently, a significant association between nitrate in drinking water and occurrence of CRC in Yogyakarta was established.","Fathmawati, Fachiroh J, Gravitiani E, Sarto, Husodo AH",J Toxicol Environ Health A,2017,Cancer AND Indonesia
11959873,"Cancer in Indonesia, present and future.","Cancer control has been in effect in Indonesia since the early 1920s. It was the Dutch Colonial Government who started with the Institution for Cancer Control, which was closed by the Japanese Occupation Administration between 1942 and 1945. After the independence of the Republic of Indonesia, a Cancer Control Foundation was established in 1962. At present, clinical and non-clinical departments in government teaching hospitals (there are 13 teaching hospitals) usually handle all cancer problems. In 1993, Dharmais Cancer Center in Jakarta was established and has become the top referral cancer hospital for Indonesia. Until now, there have been no nationwide accurate data on cancer registration, owing to a lack of funds and manpower. Cancer data collection is usually provided as a relative frequency study from several departments of the teaching hospitals. It is currently estimated that there will be at least 170-190 new cancer cases annually for each 100 000 people. The most frequent and primary cancers are cervix, breast, lymph node, skin and nasopharynx. Since Indonesia is now in a transition phase and has many problems concerning the economy and health care, we suggested a well-planned cancer control program. It includes the primary, secondary and tertiary prevention of cancer in cities, where inhabitants can afford to subsidize a certain proportion of the budgets for the implementation of this program.","Tjindarbumi D, Mangunkusumo R",Jpn J Clin Oncol,2002 Mar,Cancer AND Indonesia
39991683,Differences in diversity and composition of mucosa-associated colonic microbiota in colorectal cancer and non-colorectal cancer in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is the third most common malignancy and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Several studies have shown an association between gut microbiota and colorectal cancer. Gut microbiota is unique and can be influenced by geographic factors and habits. This study aimed to determine the diversity and composition of colonic mucosal microbiota in patients with and without colorectal cancer. AIM: To determine the diversity and composition of colonic mucosal microbiota in patients with and without colorectal cancer in Indonesia. METHODS: This case-control study included 59 subjects (35 colorectal cancer patients and 24 non-colorectal cancer patients indicated for colonoscopy at Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Center and Fatmawati Hospital. Microbiota examination was performed using 16S rRNA sequencing. Bioinformatics analysis was performed using the wf-metagenomics pipeline from EPI2Me-Labs (Oxford Nanopore Technologies platform). RESULTS: Patients with colorectal cancer had a higher median index value on the Shannon index (3.28 vs 2.82, P > 0.05) and a lower value on the Simpson index (0.050 vs 0.060, P > 0.05). Significant differences in beta diversity were observed at the genus (P = 0.002) and species levels (P = 0.001). Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Fusobacteria were the dominant phyla. The genera Bacteroides, Campylobacter, Peptostreptococcus, and Parvimonas were found more frequently in colorectal cancer, while Faecalibacterium, Haemophilus, and Phocaeicola were more frequently found in non-colorectal cancer. The relative abundance of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Campylobacter hominis, and Enterococcus faecalis species was significantly elevated in patients with colorectal cancer. Meanwhile, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Faecalibacterium duncaniae, and Prevotella copri were more commonly found in non-colorectal cancer. CONCLUSION: Patients with colorectal cancer exhibit distinct differences in the composition and diversity of their colonic mucosal microbiota compared to those with non-colorectal cancer.

35749452,"Vitamin D status in breast cancer cases following chemotherapy: A pre and post observational study in a tertiary hospital in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.","OBJECTIVES: To observe pre- and post-treatment vitamin D level and its association with treatment and concomitant factors in breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. METHODS: We performed a pre-post observational analysis that nested in an ongoing prospective cohort study of breast cancer patients at Dr. Sardjito General Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. 136 subjects were recruited from the main study. Information on subjects' socio-demographic characteristics clinical status, and tumour profile was assessed at baseline. Number of chemotherapy cycles and chemotherapy-induced nausea vomiting (CINV) were also recorded. Vitamin D concentration was measured using ELISA methods at baseline and post-treatment. Vitamin D level of <20 ng/ml and <12 ng/ml were defined as deficiency and severe deficiency. Correlation between socio-demographic and clinical profile with baseline vitamin D was tested using Spearman correlation. Paired t-test was used to evaluate changes in post-treatment vitamin D concentration. The odds ratio for a subject to experience post-treatment vitamin D decrease was assessed based on number of chemotherapy cycles and CINV severity. RESULTS: The mean vitamin D level before chemotherapy was very low (8.80+/-3.64 ng/ml) in the whole panel. Higher AST level were associated with lower vitamin D level at baseline (r = -0.188, p = 0.028). Severe deficiency was found in 82.4% subjects at baseline and the rate increased to 89.0% after chemotherapy. Eighty-five cases showed a decrease level whereas 51 showed a slight improvement. Overall, a significant decrease of the vitamin D level was observed after chemotherapy (median change 3.13+/-4.03 ng/ml, p <0.001). Subjects who received >6 cycles of chemotherapy were less likely to experience a decreased level of post-treatment vitamin D (OR = 0.436, 95% CI = 0.196-0.968, p = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS: Indonesian breast cancer patients showed pre-existing severe vitamin D deficiency and deterioration of vitamin D after chemotherapy. Future research is needed to explore its implication towards patients' survival in the local setting. Evidence-based approach also needs to be taken to address this modifiable condition, including increasing awareness of the importance of maintaining vitamin D sufficiency both in patients and the general population.","Puspitaningtyas H, Sulistyoningrum DC, Witaningrum R, Widodo I, Hardianti MS, Taroeno-Hariadi KW, Kurnianda J, Purwanto I, Hutajulu SH",PLoS One,2022,Cancer AND Indonesia
33410363,"Dietary Intake as Determinant Nongenetic Factors to Colorectal Cancer Incidence and Staging Progression: A Study in South Sulawesi Population, Indonesia.","Reports from various population-based studies indicate that the incidence of colorectal cancer may be strongly affected by dietary patterns of the respective populations. The nature of dietary patterns of specific Indonesia population on the risk of colorectal cancer might differ from previously published data with the global population. Therefore, we conducted a study where the dietary pattern in colorectal cancer patient cohorts was compared to age- and population-matched control. We documented 89 colorectal cancer cases and among 173 individuals from the South Sulawesi population. A series of logistic regression and Fisher's exact tests were utilized to test associations of dietary intakes and colorectal cancer risk as well as colorectal cancer staging. Our data demonstrate that vegetable (p-value = 8.70 x 10(-26), OR = 0.49) and fruit (p-value = 7.59x10(-5), OR = 0.70) intakes are associated with the reduced risk of colorectal cancer incidence. Conversely, acidic food, reheated food, meat, spicy food, and alcohol are associated with the increment case of cancer. Moreover, meat intake (p-value < 0.01) shows a significant association with cancer staging progression. Common dietary pattern is a determinant aspect to the colorectal cancer incidence as well as its staging progression.","Nurlaila I, Hidayat AA, Budiarto A, Mahesworo B, Purwandari K, Pardamean B",Nutr Cancer,2021,Cancer AND Indonesia
37599514,The positive effects and mechanisms of honey against breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is a malignancy that occurs in cells in the breast tissue where cells in the breast divide and grow out of control, invade surrounding tissues, or spread (metastasize) to distant areas of the body. METHOD: This review was systematically carried out through PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar websites in English and Indonesian using the keyword content of the article, obtaining 21 selected articles. This review demonstrates honey's promising mechanism of combined synergistic effect for breast cancer management. CONCLUSION: Antioxidants in honey intercept free radicals of phenolic compounds which are the main factors responsible for the antioxidant activity of honey. The antimicrobial activity in most honey is due to the enzymatic production of hydrogen peroxide, and its anti-cancer properties are discussed in this section.","Usman AN, Ahmad M",Breast Dis,2023,Cancer AND Indonesia
30315686,Unmet supportive care needs and psychological distress among parents of children with cancer in Indonesia.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the needs and associating factors, psychological distress of parents, when taking care of children with cancer in Indonesia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 100 parents of children with cancer from the pediatric ward of two hospitals in Indonesia. The parents were assessed using the Indonesian version of the Supportive Care Needs Survey for Partner and Caregiver (unmet needs) and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (psychological distress). The factors associated with unmet needs were analyzed using hierarchical linear regression. RESULTS: Among the surveyed parents, 83% had over 10 unmet needs. Among these unmet needs, need for information was the highest one. In the self-report measure using a clinical cut-off, 49% of the parents reported signs of anxiety, and 25% had signs of depression. Parents reporting clinically relevant levels of anxiety had more unmet needs than parents without clinically relevant anxiety. Having fewer children was correlated with higher work and social needs, and higher levels of education were correlated with more psychological needs. However, the children's clinical variables were not associated with the overall needs in the regression model. CONCLUSIONS: Most parents of children with cancer reported a need for more information and reported signs of anxiety and depression. Parents with fewer children and higher levels of education were identified as a vulnerable population due to having greater needs. The result of this study can be used to improve supportive care for parents of children with cancer in hospital settings.","Aziza YDA, Wang ST, Huang MC",Psychooncology,2019 Jan,Cancer AND Indonesia
37827225,Anti-cancer bioprospecting on medicinal plants from Indonesia: A review.,"The Indonesian archipelago is home to the second largest biodiversity in the world and is inhabited by more than 300 ethnic groups with a total population of more than 270 million. The indigenous population still rely on traditional medicine practices, especially the use of plant-based remedies. Although modern science-based exploration on Indonesian medicinal plants started with the European settlement in the archipelago in the 16th century, it was not until the 1970's that the phytochemistry of Indonesian medicinal plants was recognized for its potency. The need for new cancer cures to increase the quality of human life has led to the bioprospecting of medicinal plants including those of Indonesian origin. Despite published reports on the anticancer potency of Indonesian medicinal plants, to date there has been no comprehensive review on this topic. In this manuscript, we review the phytochemical and pharmacological studies on medicinal plants from Indonesia related to cancer therapy. Established databases (GARUDA, SciFinder, and PubMed) were used to collate data from 1990 to 2022, resulting in the description of 134 medicinal plants and their phytochemical and pharmacological properties including examples containing potent agents against breast, leukaemia, cervix, lung, and colon cancer cell lines based on in vitro bioassays and in vivo evaluation. These findings provide valuable insights into the bioprospecting of Indonesian medicinal plant providing directions for future studies, including the development of new therapeutics, both as botanicals or by using conventional dosage.","Rani DM, Wongso H, Purwoko RY, Winarto NB, Shalas AF, Triatmoko B, Pratama ANW, Keller PA, Nugraha AS",Phytochemistry,2023 Dec,Cancer AND Indonesia

Studies had been done to search for predictors of response such as sTIL intensity and  expression, which is known to block sTIL action in killing cancer cells. This research assessed sTIL intensity and  expression as predictors of response to neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer. The preliminary data might be used to better tailored breast cancer patient therapy, considering the availability of anti-PD-1/ PD- L1 immunotherapy nowadays. OBJECTIVE: To assess TIL intensity,  expressions, and their roles as pathological predictors of breast cancer response to neoadjuvant therapy in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital (CMH). METHOD: This was an observational analytic retrospective cohort study on breast cancer patients undergoing biopsy/review of biopsy specimens, receiving neoadjuvant therapy and mastectomy in CMH from January 2014 to December 2021. Sixty cases fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Total sampling was done.   expression (immunohistochemistry, clone 22C3) and sTIL intensity (histopathology) was examined in the biopsy specimen. Linear regression analysis was done to determine the independent predictors of neoadjuvant therapy response (evaluated in the mastectomy specimen with residual cancer burden/ RCB score). RESULTS: There were 60 female patients, median age 46 years old. 91,7% had invasive carcinoma of no special type. Median sTIL intensity was 10% (1%-70%). 58,3% patients had low sTIL intensity (</=10%). 28,3% patients had positive  expression (CPS >/=1). Only 8,3% patients had pCR, while 90% patients had RCB class II-III. Every 1% increase in sTIL intensity, no lymphovascular invasion, and taxane chemotherapy were predicted to lower RCB score by 0,058, 0,781, dan 0,594, respectively.  expression associated with pCR-RCB class I (p=0,048), but CPS score was not a predictor of RCB score in linear regression analysis. CONSLUSION: sTIL intensity was an independent predictor of breast cancer response to neoadjuvant therapy in RSCM.  expression associated with pCR-RCB class I, but CPS score was not a predictor of RCB score.","Rustamadji P, Felicia D, Wuyung PE, Hellyanti T",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2023 Oct 1,Cancer AND Indonesia

The design of this study was a quasi-experimental pre-post test with a control group. We recruited children with cancer aged 7-18 years (n = 58) using a consecutive sampling method and assigned them to intervention and control groups (n = 29 in each group). The intervention group had the COMMASH-E intervention while the control group received routine care. Fatigue, sleep quality and functional status were measured on days 1 and 4 using Allen's Fatigue in Childhood Cancer Scale, the Sleep Problem in Children Scale and the Barthel Index, respectively. T-dependent and independent tests and Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA) tests were performed for the data analysis. There were significant differences in fatigue, sleep quality and functional status between the intervention and control groups after the COMMASH-E intervention. Nonetheless, chemotherapy drugs contributed to the children's sleep quality. COMMASH-E was found to be more effective than routine care in the reducing fatigue and increasing the sleep quality and functional status of children with cancer.","Sriasih NK, Allenidekania, Wanda D",Compr Child Adolesc Nurs,2019,Cancer AND Indonesia
36641657,Correlation analysis of HIF-1alpha and Ca15-3 in response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced breast cancer: A cohort study in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer among women worldwide and a leading cause of death in Indonesia. The primary treatment of locally advanced BC is neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). The rapid proliferation of tumor cells in a neoplastic microenvironment is largely due to hypoxia, which also encourages the development of chemoresistant BC. The master regulator of the hypoxia response is hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha). The response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) is an objective response metric that demonstrates the efficacy of a NAC based mostly on the size of the tumor. Ca15-3 is the protein product of the MUC1 gene and is the most widely used serum marker in BC. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between HIF-1alpha and RECIST and between Ca15-3 and RECIST and to assess the relationship among all of them in BC. METHODS: This observational study used the prospective cohort method included 11 patients with histopathologically confirmed BC, specifically invasive ductal carcinoma. We evaluated the changes in HIF-1alpha and Ca15-3 serum levels using ELISA and measured tumor lesions with RECIST. The procedure was carried out twice. Serum levels were measured at baseline, and after receiving two cycles of NAC (5 weeks). RESULTS: Among the 11 patients included in this study, HIF-1alpha, Ca15-3, and RECIST decreased significantly after NAC. The changes in RECIST correlated with Ca15-3: each unit decrease in RECIST score was associated with a 0.3-unit decrease in Ca15-3 levels (p = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: There was a decrease in HIF-1alpha, followed by a decrease in Ca15-3 and RECIST in response to chemotherapy. There was a statistically significant correlation between Ca15-3 and response to chemotherapy. This study evidences the relationship between factors that shape the local tumor microenvironment.","Manginstar C, Oley MH, Oley MC, Merung M, Langi FLFG, Kepel BJ, Rusli LV, Islam AA, Faruk M",Breast Dis,2022,Cancer AND Indonesia
30728000,Pathological profiles and clinical management challenges of breast cancer emerging in young women in Indonesia: a hospital-based study.,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer diagnosed at a young age is often associated with aggressive biology, advanced stage, and unfavorable prognosis. The median age of breast cancer diagnosis in Indonesia is younger (48 vs. 68 years-old in Europe) with a relatively higher proportion of patients younger than 40 years old. Although prognosis and outcome of young breast cancer are well studied in developed nations, research evaluating biological characteristics, delivered treatment, and clinical outcomes is very limited in Indonesia. METHODS: We analyzed all breast cancer patients who underwent surgery at Dr. Sardjito Hospital, Indonesia, in 2012-2017. Details of pathology profiles, treatment administrated, and outcomes, as well as reproductive factors among patients younger than 40 years old, were collected and analyzed. Kaplan-Meier curve was used to assess conditional survival based on baseline characteristics. RESULTS: From the total of 1259 breast cancer patients (median age 51 years), 144 (11.4%) were younger than 40 years old (median age 37 years). Of these young patients, 19 (13.2%) were bilateral and 92 (64%) were diagnosed in advanced stages (stages IIIA-C and IV). Median tumor diameter was 5.5 cm and nodal infiltration was present in 73%. Distant metastasis was found in 16% at the time of diagnosis. Moderate and poor differentiation of tumor were 20.8 and 78.5%, respectively, and lymphovascular invasion was found in 90.3%. Around 40% were hormone receptor-positive, 30.6% human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive, and 38.2% triple negative. Patients underwent radical surgery in 121 cases (84%) and breast conserving surgery in 7 cases (4.9%). Adjuvant chemotherapy was administrated in 68% and hormonal therapy in 34%. Progression-free survival was significantly shorter in patients with advanced stage, skin and chest wall involvement (T4), positive lymph node infiltration, positive hormonal receptor, and triple negative subtype (log-rank Mantel-Cox tests, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: We found a high frequency of young breast cancer with biologically more aggressive tumors, late diagnosis, frequent relapse, and poor prognosis. Further actions to improve clinical management and meet psychosocial needs in young breast cancer patients are warranted.","Anwar SL, Raharjo CA, Herviastuti R, Dwianingsih EK, Setyoheriyanto D, Avanti WS, Choridah L, Harahap WA, Darwito, Aryandono T, Wulaningsih W",BMC Womens Health,2019 Feb 6,Cancer AND Indonesia
28870266,Comparison of the lived experiences of family caregivers of patients with dementia and of patients with cancer in Indonesia.,"ABSTRACTBackground:Dementia, even more than cancer, demands long-term care. While in Indonesia cancer is accepted as a disease requiring caregiving, dementia is still considered ""a normal condition."" These differences might affect the experiences of caregivers, especially those relating to social health, the subject of our study. We aim to describe and compare the lived experiences of family caregivers of patients with cancer (PWC) with those of patients with dementia (PWD) in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, and to explore the role of their social health in these experiences. METHOD: A qualitative design was applied. In-depth face-to-face interviews were conducted with PWC and PWD caregivers in two outpatient clinics of a tertiary hospital. The constant comparative method was applied to analyze the data that were interpreted using the concept of social health to explore the experiences of the caregivers. We used Atlas.ti software. RESULTS: Three themes were identified: problems with caregiving, dealing with problems, and beliefs in caregiving. We found more similarities than differences in the experiences of caregivers in both groups. Half of the categories were related to social health: challenges, consequences, hiding, social support, and the caregiver's approach. The organization of dementia care is characterized by simplicity and direct ties between medical specialists, PWD, and caregivers, whereas cancer care encounters coordination problems. CONCLUSIONS: Family caregivers of both groups mostly had similar experiences of the caregiving process. Gaining a better understanding of the specific experiences of caregivers, and their social health, opens new avenues for interventions to improve their quality of life.","Kristanti MS, Engels Y, Effendy C, Astuti, Utarini A, Vernooij-Dassen M",Int Psychogeriatr,2018 Jun,Cancer AND Indonesia
33577563,"Survival outcome and prognostic factors of patients with nasopharyngeal cancer in Yogyakarta, Indonesia: A hospital-based retrospective study.","PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the survival outcome and prognostic factors of patients with nasopharyngeal cancer accessing treatment in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. METHODS: Data on 759 patients with NPC diagnosed from 2007 to 2016 at Dr Sardjito General Hospital were included. Potential prognostic variables included sociodemographic, clinicopathology and treatment parameters. Multivariable analyses were implemented using semi-parametric Cox proportional hazards modelling and fully parametric survival analysis. RESULTS: The median time of observation was 14.39 months. In the whole cohort the median observed survival was 31.08 months. In the univariable analysis, age, education status, insurance type, BMI, ECOG index, stage and treatment strategy had an impact on overall survival (OS) (p values <0.01). Semi-parametric multivariable analyses with stage stratification showed that education status, ECOG index, and treatment modality were independent prognostic factors for OS (p values <0.05). In the fully parametric models age, education status, ECOG index, stage, and treatment modality were independent prognostic factors for OS (p values <0.05). For both multivariable analyses, all treatment strategies were associated with a reduced hazard (semi-parametric models, p values <0.05) and a better OS (parametric models, p values <0.05) compared with no treatment. Furthermore, compared with radiation alone or chemotherapy alone, a combination of chemotherapy and radiation either in a form of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT), sequential chemotherapy and radiation, or induction chemotherapy followed by CCRT demonstrated a reduced hazard (hazard ratio/HR 0.226, 95% confidence interval/CI 0.089-0.363, and HR 0.390, 95%CI 0.260-0.519) and a better OS (time ratio/TR 3.108, 95%CI 1.274-4.942 and TR 2.531, 95%CI 1.829-3.233) (p values < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Median OS for the cohort was low compared to those reported in both endemic and non-endemic regions. By combining the findings of multivariable analyses, we showed that age, education status, ECOG index, stage and first treatment modality were independent predictors for the OS.","Hutajulu SH, Howdon D, Taroeno-Hariadi KW, Hardianti MS, Purwanto I, Indrasari SR, Herdini C, Hariwiyanto B, Ghozali A, Kusumo H, Dhamiyati W, Dwidanarti SR, Tan IB, Kurnianda J, Allsop MJ",PLoS One,2021,Cancer AND Indonesia
31759353,"P21 Ser31Arg and FGFR2 rs2981582 Polymorphisms as Risk Factors for Early Onset of Breast Cancer in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.","OBJECTIVES: Breast cancer tend to be more progressive with poorer prognosis in younger patients than those at an older age. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) of P53 Pro72Arg, MDM2 SNP309, P21 Ser31Arg, ER SNP594, HER2 Ile655Val, and FGFR2 rs2981582 have drawn attention as genetic factors associated with cancer risk. However, there were contradictory results involving different races and their association is still unknown in Indonesian populations. This study was performed to examine the proportion of these six genes polymorphisms and their associations with age of onset of breast cancer patients in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. METHODS: Biorepository DNA from 199 patients registered at Dr. Sardjito Hospital Yogyakarta from 2006-2013 were tested for polymorphisms using the PCR-RFLP method. Samples were taken from two age groups; early-onset (55 years). Chi-square tests with odds ratio were used for data analysis. RESULTS: The mean age of the early-onset group was 36+/-4.2 years, while the late-onset group was 62+/-6.9 years. AA genotype and A allele of P21 and TT genotypes and T allele of FGFR2 were significantly more frequent and were associated with an increased risk of early-onset of breast cancer (95%CI: 2.54 and 1.59; 2.63 and 1.64, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that the A allele of P21 and the allele T of FGFR2 may be associated with an increased risk of early-onset of breast cancer in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.

38788058,Contraceptive use with breast cancer incidence in Indonesia.,"INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide and is a significant threat to public health. This study aims to conduct a systematic review of the relationship between hormonal contraceptive use and breast cancer incidence. METHODS: The search was conducted using Google Scholar, Proquest, Pubmed and one Indonesian database, Garuda, using English and Indonesian keywords. The inclusion criteria in this study were the publication year of the last five years, namely 2019-2023, English and Indonesian language, case-control observational research, using the Indonesian population, and full-text access. RESULTS: A total of 165 studies were obtained from the Google Scholar database, including 104 studies. The overall multivariate analysis revealed that there was a statistically significant association of hormonal contraception with the incidence of breast cancer with OR values in the range of 2-6. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this systematic study suggest that the use of hormones can contribute to hormonal imbalances that further increase breast cell proliferation and disrupt gene expression, resulting in uncontrolled cell development/cancer. In addition, the findings recommend increasing the number of studies on this topic to obtain more adequate and possibly more diverse information.","Sulfiana S, Prihantono P, Usman AN, Ahmad M, Aryadi Arsyad M, Mumang AA",Breast Dis,2024,Cancer AND Indonesia

These cancers are detectable early, however only a few women participate in cancer screening especially in developing countries, including Indonesia. Family, culture and religion can influence why women have screening. Husbands, in Muslim families have a significant role in the family's health including their wife's reproductive health. However, information about Muslim husbands' roles in wife's health especially cancer is limited. Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine Muslim husband's roles in women's health and cancer from the perspectives of Muslim women. Methods: This study was a qualitative study using a descriptive exploratory approach. Purposive sampling was used to recruit 20 Muslim women, 10 from urban areas and 10 from rural areas of West Java Province, Indonesia. Women were interviewed using a semi-structured interview schedule. Data from the interviews were analyzed using the Comparative Analysis for Interview technique. Results: The study found two main themes emerged from the analysis: Muslim husbands' extensive roles in promoting women's health and Husbands' have limited actions with regard to cancer screening. This study also found similarities between rural and urban women's opinions that in general husbands actively supported promoting women's health. Conclusion: Muslim husbands focused on encouraging women to have healthy lifestyles, however, a lack of support from husbands related to cancer screening. This behaviour could be a hindrance to Muslim women's participation in prevention and the early detection of cancer. There is a need to improve Muslim husbands' awareness in women's cancer.","Widiasih R, Nelson K",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2018 Jun 25,Cancer AND Indonesia
39816081,Feasibility and pilot study of Indonesia's first telehealth support program for gynecological cancer survivors undergoing chemotherapy.,"Most Indonesian gynecological cancer survivors experience chemotherapy side effects on their physical and mental health as they face unmet needs of supportive care, which increases the likelihood of discontinuing treatment. Interventions in telehealth assist survivors in resolving these issues. The aim of this pilot study was to determine the feasibility of fighting distress, self-efficacy, health effects, and sexual (FoRSHE-X) interventions and evaluate their potential impact on distress level, side effects knowledge and management, self-efficacy, and sexual quality of life. The study involved gynecological cancer survivors who underwent chemotherapy and participated in ten weeks of individual social media-based education, tele-coaching, and teleconsultations, from September 2023 to June 2024. The study feasibility and pilot outcomes were evaluated using descriptive statistics and qualitative thematic analysis. Of the twelve women recruited, six (50%) completed the study, filled out pre- and post-intervention questionnaires, and participated in interviews. Fifty-four virtual education, coaching, and consultation sessions were performed individually. The statistical results indicated that participants were highly satisfied with the telehealth program, which significantly increased their knowledge (p = 0.02), health practices (p = 0.04), and self-efficacy (p = 0.01). The qualitative analysis highlighted participants' and coaches' perspectives on the study's acceptance, barriers, and recommendations. In conclusion, this pilot study suggests that a definitive trial to assess the FoRSHE-X interventions is feasible, acceptable, and can be applied not only to gynecological cancer survivors but also to other types of cancer, thereby broadening the potential impact of the study.","Afiyanti Y, Juliastuti D, So WK, Setiowati R, Nasution LA, Prawesti AD",Narra J,2024 Dec,Cancer AND Indonesia
30139225,Oral Contraceptive and Breast Cancer Risks: a Case Control Study in Six Referral Hospitals in Indonesia.,"Objective: This study aimed to understand the effects of the use of oral contraceptive to breast cancer risk in six referral hospitals in Indonesia. Methods: The research design was hospital based case-control, conducted in 2013. Population was women patients aged 15 years and above in six cancer-referral hospitals in five provinces. Total of 762 people were included in this study consisting of 381 who are diagnosed with breast cancer as confirmed by histopathologic examination in inpatient surgery ward, and 381 people who are not diagnosed with breast cancer based on interview in outpatient surgery ward as control group. A set of data were collected including the use of oral contraceptives, age, early menarche, childbirth status, breastfeeding status, obesity, unhealthy diet, history of benign breast tumors, family history of breast cancer, and age of menopause. Result: Results showed that Odds Ratio (OR) of patients using oral contraceptive <6 years was 1.93 (95% CI 1.23 - 3.03) and OR of those using oral contraceptive >/= 6 years was 2.90 (95% CI 1.65- 5.09) as compared to people who did not use oral contraceptive. Conclusion: Use of oral contraceptive in patients was indicated to increase the risk of breast cancer. Longer the duration of using oral contraceptive tend to have higher the risk of breast cancer.","Wahidin M, Djuwita R, Adisasmita A",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2018 Aug 24,Cancer AND Indonesia
22850550,Single-visit approach of cervical cancer screening: see and treat in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: We performed a cross-sectional study in Indonesia to evaluate the performance of a single-visit approach of cervical cancer screening, using visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), histology and cryotherapy in low-resource settings. METHODS: Women having limited access to health-care facilities were screened by trained doctors using VIA. If the test was positive, biopsies were taken and when eligible, women were directly treated with cryotherapy. Follow-up was performed with VIA and cytology after 6 months. When cervical cancer was suspected or diagnosed, women were referred. The positivity rate, positive predictive value (PPV) and approximate specificity of the VIA test were calculated. The detection rate for cervical lesions was given. RESULTS: Screening results were completed in 22 040 women, of whom 92.7% had never been screened. Visual inspection with acetic acid was positive in 4.4%. The PPV of VIA to detect CIN I or greater and CIN II or greater was 58.7% and 29.7%, respectively. The approximate specificity was 98.1%, and the detection rate for CIN I or greater was 2.6%. CONCLUSION: The single-visit approach cervical cancer screening performed well, showing See and Treat is a promising way to reduce cervical cancer in Indonesia.","Vet JN, Kooijman JL, Henderson FC, Aziz FM, Purwoto G, Susanto H, Surya IG, Budiningsih S, Cornain S, Fleuren GJ, Trimbos JB, Peters AA",Br J Cancer,2012 Aug 21,Cancer AND Indonesia
37378921,"The Relationship between Ethnicity and Health Seeking Behavior for Colorectal Cancer in East Java, Indonesia: A Case Study of Arek, Mataraman, and Pendalungan Ethnic Groups.","OBJECTIVE: The rising incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) in East Java has highlighted the need to investigate inter-ethnic causality. Previous studies have examined the relationship between ethnicity and health behavior in relation to CRC in East Java Province, but it is important to explore health-seeking behavior among CRC patients within the Arek, Mataraman, and Pendalungan ethnic groups, as these groups may have different behavioral patterns due to limited literacy. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 230 respondents, with 86 from Arek, 72 from Mataraman, and 72 from Pendalungan. Data were collected from August 1 to October 30, 2022,, and analyzed using structural equation modeling with SmartPLS application analysis. RESULT: The P-values for the direct path between culture and health-seeking behavior was 0.009, indicating a statistically significant relationship. Similarly, the P-Values for the direct path between self-health awareness and health seeking behavior is 0.000, indicating a very strong and statistically significant relationship. P-Values for the direct path between health accessibility and health seeking behavior was 0.257, suggesting that the relationship was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Cultural values and self-health awareness are suggested as important predictors of health-seeking behavior among CRC patients in East Java.. The study highlights the need for tailored healthcare services for different ethnic groups. Overall, these findings can help healthcare providers in addressing the specific needs of CRC patients in East Java.","Budianto A, Andarini S, Hariyanti T, Musliha N",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2023 Jun 1,Cancer AND Indonesia
39095977,Psychological Impact of Bladder Cancer: Insights from 219 Patients and Caregivers in Indonesia Using DASS-21 (2019-2023).,"BACKGROUND Bladder cancer (BC) is a common disease worldwide. Low survival rates and high recurrence lead to the risk of mental disorders. This study analyzed 219 patients with bladder cancer using the Indonesian Version of the 21-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and related factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS This cross-sectional study included 219 patients diagnosed with bladder cancer during 2019-2023 in a referral hospital in Indonesia. Data were collected using a questionnaire that assessed the characteristics of the patients and a DASS-21 questionnaire. RESULTS Some patients and caregivers experienced depression, stress, and anxiety. The percentage of caregivers who experienced anxiety was higher than for patients (47.9% vs 45.7%). Statistical analysis showed that age, income, and marital status were associated with the incidence of depression (p=0.000, p=0.001, and p=0.000, respectively), anxiety (p=0.000, p=0.012, and p=0.001, respectively), and stress (p=0.000, p=0.007, and p=0.000, respectively). Routes of patient admission (p=0.043, respectively) and employment status (p=0.005, respectively) were associated with the incidence of depression in patients (p=0.043, respectively). Employment status was also associated with stress in patients (p=0.038, respectively). Statistical analysis of caregivers found that routes of patient admission and marital status were related to the incidence of depression among caregivers (p=0.036 and p=0.007, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Monitoring and providing support for patients and caregivers are needed to prevent poor prognosis due to psychological problems, including paying attention to sociodemographic factors.","Djatisoesanto W, Azmi YA, Yatindra IBGTY",Med Sci Monit,2024 Aug 3,Cancer AND Indonesia
24870763,Parents' and health-care providers' perspectives on side- effects of childhood cancer treatment in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Efficacy of childhood cancer treatment in low-income countries may be impacted by parents' and health-care providers' perspectives on chemotherapy-related side-effects. This study explores prevalence and severity of side-effects in childhood cancer, and compares health beliefs about side-effects between parents and health-care providers, and between nurses and doctors in Indonesia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Semi-structured questionnaires were filled in by 40 parents and 207 health-care providers in an academic hospital. RESULTS: Parents exporessed a desire to receive more information about side-effects (98%) and worried about this aspect of treatment (90%), although side-effects were less severe than expected (66%). The most frequent was behavior alteration (98%) and the most severe was hair loss. Only 26% of parents consulted doctors about side-effects. More parents, compared to health-care providers, believed that medicines work better when side-effects are more severe (p<0.001), and accepted severe side-effects (p=0.021). More health-care providers, compared to parents, believed that chemotherapy can be stopped or the dosage altered when there are side-effects (p=0.011). More nurses, compared to doctors, stated that side-effects were unbearable (p=0.004) and made them doubt efficacy of treatment (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Behavior alteration is the most frequent and hair loss the most severe side-effect. Apparent discrepancies in health beliefs about side-effects exist between parents and health-care providers. A sustainable parental education program about side-effects is recommended. Health-care providers need to update and improve their knowledge and communication skills in order to give appropriate information. Such measures may improve outcome of childhood cancer treatment in low-income countries, where adherence to therapy is a major issue.","Gunawan S, Wolters E, van Dongen J, van de Ven P, Sitaresmi M, Veerman A, Mantik M, Kaspers G, Mostert S",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2014,Cancer AND Indonesia
38009492,"General dentists' knowledge, perceptions, and practices regarding oral potentially malignant disorders and oral cancer in Indonesia.","INTRODUCTION: The most effective means for reducing oral cancer (OC) mortality is by preventing late-stage disease. Early diagnosis can be improved by increasing awareness among healthcare providers, specifically general dental practitioners (GDP). Therefore, our study aimed to assess GDPs' knowledge of OC risk factors and perceived competence in performing conventional oral examination (COE) in routine dental practice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in five provinces of Indonesia, namely: Aceh, Banda Aceh (BA); Bandung, West Java (WJ); special district Jakarta (JKT), JKT; Pontianak, West Kalimantan (WK); and Sorong, West Papua (WP). The local Dental Association or Faculty of Dentistry invited the GDPs to attend an education program and complete the survey. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-seven GDPs completed the survey (WJ, n = 63; BA, n = 44, JKT, n = 27; WP, n = 23; and WP, n = 20). A large proportion (164 out of 177, 92.66%) of GDPs felt they had received insufficient training to equip them to diagnose OC and as many as 22.6% (n = 40) did not refer to specialists when they found suspicious mucosal lesions. Notwithstanding the significant regional variations, the majority of Indonesian GDPs self-reported inadequate knowledge and awareness of OC and scarce confidence in performing COE. CONCLUSION: GDP knowledge of OC risk factors and COE is key to improving early diagnosis of OC at a community level. Therefore, it is suggested that the lack of knowledge and confidence of GDPs reported here should be addressed through the national dental curriculum in Indonesia.","Sari EF, Hidayat W, Dewi TS, Rezeki S, Krimadi R, McCullough MJ, Cirillo N",Clin Exp Dent Res,2024 Feb,Cancer AND Indonesia
31776894,Knowledge and Acceptance Towards Mammography as Breast Cancer Screening Tool Among Yogyakarta Women and Health Care Providers (Mammography Screening in Indonesia).,"Annual mammography remains the gold standard of asymptomatic breast cancer screening for women starting at the age of 40. However, Indonesia has not designated mammography as its national screening program. To help policymakers decide whether mammography should be introduced into a national program, it is important to comprehensively understand the knowledge and acceptance of both consumers and providers. A total of 25 subjects including a range of women and health care professionals (HCPs) in Yogyakarta Province were recruited using purposive, maximum variation sampling and then interviewed in-depth. The interviews were recorded and all data were taken and transcribed from the audio recording, which were subsequently translated to English and analyzed thematically. Almost all of Yogyakarta women had heard about the term of mammography. However, only few of them have let themselves be screened, mainly because of their perceived lack of urgency to screen for asymptomatic breast cancer. Another important reason was the high cost of mammography. Meanwhile, several HCPs believed that breast cancer has not been a priority for the government and hence the government limited mammography screening's access and excluded it from the national insurance coverage. Most women in Yogyakarta have a good understanding about breast cancer screening, but their acceptance of mammography as a breast cancer screening tool is significantly influenced by high cost, limited access, and lack of urgency.","Choridah L, Icanervilia AV, de Wit MJM, van Asselt ADI, Kurniawan WT, Fahmi YI, Rengganis AA",J Cancer Educ,2021 Jun,Cancer AND Indonesia
30176284,Measuring the Symptom Experience of Patients With Cancer in Indonesia: Cross-Cultural Adaptation and Validation of the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale-Indonesian Version.,"CONTEXT: Little is known about cancer-related symptoms in terms of prevalence, severity, and distress among patients with cancer in Indonesia because of a lack of a valid and reliable scale. OBJECTIVES: To translate and validate the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) among cancer patients in Indonesia. METHODS: Two procedures consisting of forward-backward translation and validation were conducted. The validation process including pretesting involved 34 cancer patients, and the psychometric testing of the Indonesian version of MSAS (MSAS-I) involved 207 cancer patients. Internal consistency, test-retest reliability, construct, and concurrent validity of the MSAS-I were established. RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the total scale and subscales of the MSAS-I ranged from 0.75 to 0.87. The interclass correlations for test-retest reliability ranged from 0.80 to 0.89. A two-factor structure in the MSAS-I was produced by exploratory factor analysis, and the two factors accounted for 28.34% of the cumulative variance. In addition, the concurrent validity was demonstrated by the significant associations between the subscales of the MSAS-I and their corresponding subscales in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30, with r = -0.25 to -0.65 (all P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The MSAS-I presents a valid and reliable scale for assessing symptom frequency, severity, and distress among patients with cancer in Indonesia. IMPLICATION FOR NURSING: The MSAS-I can assess physical and psychological symptoms during cancer treatment. In addition, the MSAS-I may facilitate in measuring the effectiveness of symptom management strategies.","Haryani H, Hsu YY, Warsini S, Wang ST",J Pain Symptom Manage,2018 Dec,Cancer AND Indonesia
37394335,Advance Care Planning in Indonesia: Current state and future prospects.,"Indonesia is a low-middle income country in Southeast Asia, as well as the world's fourth most populous and largest archipelagic nation. Indonesia has approximately 1,300 ethnic groups that speak 800 different languages and are typically collectivist and religiously devout. With an aging population and an increasing number of cancer patients, palliative care in the country remains scarcely available, disproportionally distributed, and underfunded. All of these factors (economic level, geographical and cultural landscapes, and palliative care level of development) pose a considerable impact on the adoption of advance care planning in Indonesia. Nonetheless, recent advocacy initiatives promise some hopes in advance care planning in Indonesia. Furthermore, local studies suggested opportunities to implement advance care planning, particularly through capacity building and a culturally sensitive approach to it.

35618675,Building on health security capacities in Indonesia: Lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic responses and challenges.,"As an active member country of the WHO's International Health Regulation and Global Health Security Agenda, Indonesia, the world's fourth-most populous and largest archipelagic country has recorded the second-highest COVID-19 cases in Asia with over 1.8 million cases in early June 2021. This geographically and socially diverse country has a dynamic national and sub-national government coordination with decentralized authorities that can complicate a pandemic response which often requires nationally harmonized policies, adaptability to sub-national contexts and global interconnectedness. This paper analyses and reviews COVID-19 public data, regulations, guidance documents, statements and other related official documents to present a narrative that summarizes the government's COVID-19 response strategies. It further analyses the challenges and achievements of the country's zoonotic diseases preparedness and responses and lastly provides relevant recommendations. Findings are presented in four sections according to the Global Health Security Agenda capacities, namely epidemiological surveillance (detect capacity); laboratory diagnostic testing (respond capacity); data management and analysis (enable capacity); and the role of sub-national governments. The COVID-19 pandemic has been a catalyst for the rapid transformation of existing surveillance systems, inter-related stakeholder coordination and agile development from the pre-pandemic health security capacities. This paper offers several recommendations on surveillance, laboratory capacity and data management, which might be useful for Indonesia and other countries with similar characteristics beyond the COVID-19 response, such as achieving long-term health security, zoonoses and pandemic prevention, as well as a digital transformation of their governmental capacities.","Aisyah DN, Mayadewi CA, Budiharsana M, Solikha DA, Ali PB, Igusti G, Kozlakidis Z, Manikam L",Zoonoses Public Health,2022 Sep,Cancer AND Indonesia
21266448,Translation and validation of EORTC QLQ-C30 into Indonesian version for cancer patients in Indonesia.,"OBJECTIVE: Quality of life studies in Indonesia are still uncommon. This research was aimed to validate the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 in Indonesian version. The standard procedure of forward-backward translation was adhered to in the translation procedures. The validity procedure included reliability, convergent and discriminant validity, known-groups validity, factor analysis and external convergent validity. METHODS: Data were collected from cancer patients in the Oncology Department of Sardjito Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia, who were treated with cisplatin at the dosage >/=50 mg/m(2) as monotherapy or in combinations. The Short Form-36 was used to assess the external convergent validity of our translated questionnaire. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-eight patients were recruited from March 2009 to November 2009. The internal consistency with values of >0.70 was observed in the Indonesian version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 scales. All items in the questionnaire met the criteria of convergent and discriminant validity, except for items 5. Both of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 and the Short Form-36 showed that different diagnoses were associated with a similar impact on quality of life. Factor analysis showed that only the role function and social function loaded onto the second factor together. Correlations between the Indonesian versions of both questionnaires were moderate: between 0.18 and 0.48 for the physical, emotional, social, fatigue and pain domains. CONCLUSIONS: The Indonesian version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 can be used as a questionnaire to assess quality of life in Indonesian cancer patients with high-emetogenic treatments.","Perwitasari DA, Atthobari J, Dwiprahasto I, Hakimi M, Gelderblom H, Putter H, Nortier JW, Guchelaar HJ, Kaptein AA",Jpn J Clin Oncol,2011 Apr,Cancer AND Indonesia
40127381,"Patterns of Complementary Medicine Utilization in Patients With Breast Cancer and Colorectal Cancer: A Cross-Sectional Study at a Tertiary Referral Hospital in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.","PURPOSE: The utilization of complementary medicine (CM) in patients with cancer brings substantial challenges to optimal cancer care by posing a risk of side effects and drug interaction, and might delay cancer care delivery. We aimed to characterize the patterns and predictors of CM utilization in patients with breast cancer (BC) and patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), and the impact on presentation and diagnosis interval. METHODS: We interviewed patients with BC and patients with CRC using a semistructured questionnaire to gather sociodemographic, clinical, presentation and diagnosis interval, and CM utilization data. The domains of CM used were categorized according to the classification of the National Institutes of Health/National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. RESULTS: One hundred forty-two patients with BC and 227 patients with CRC (N = 369) were included. The prevalence of CM utilization was 69.9%, with biologically based therapies being the most commonly used type. Younger age, higher educational attainment, and a greater number of health facility visits before diagnosis were significantly associated with higher odds of CM utilization (odds ratio [OR], 2.05 [95% CI, 1.19 to 3.54]; P = .010; OR, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.02 to 1.11]; P = .007, respectively). The diagnosis interval was significantly longer in patients who used CM compared to nonusers (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.74 [95% CI, 1.77 to 4.26]; P < .001). A greater number of CM modalities used were significantly associated with longer presentation and diagnosis intervals (IRR, 1.68 [95% CI, 1.06 to 2.66]; P = .027; IRR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.04 to 2.52]; P = .033, respectively). CONCLUSION: A significant portion of the local patients with BC and patients with CRC used CM. CM utilization was associated with age, education, number of health facility visits, and prolonged diagnosis interval. These findings underscore the need for CM disclosure among patients for better patient education and monitoring.","Wiranata JA, Hutajulu SH, Suryani ND, Harvianti RRA, Jasmine A, Astari YK, Puspitaningtyas H, Hardianti MS, Prabandari YS",JCO Glob Oncol,2025 Mar,Cancer AND Indonesia

29374592,Risk assessment of aflatoxin B1 exposure from maize and peanut consumption in Indonesia using the margin of exposure and liver cancer risk estimation approaches.,"Aflatoxin B1 (AfB1) is a secondary fungal metabolite product widely found in many foodstuffs and considered a public health concern worldwide due to its genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. Tropical climate and inappropriate food safety practices in Indonesia are the favorable conditions for AfB1 contamination of foodstuffs. Despite these challenges, there has been a limited number of risk assessment of AfB1 conducted in Indonesia. Therefore, this paper aimed to gather all available occurrence data of AfB1 in maize and peanut originating from Indonesia and used the occurrence data to evaluate the risk of exposure to AfB1 using the Margin of Exposure (MOE) and the quantitative liver cancer risk approaches established by EFSA and FAO/WHO respectively. Risk assessment using both the MOE and quantitative liver cancer risk approaches revealed that AfB1 exposure from maize and peanut consumption in Indonesia is of concern. The MOE values derived from consumption of maize and peanut originating from Indonesia were generally below 10,000, and for several occurrence data were even below 1000. The estimated number of liver cancer cases associated with AfB1 exposure generally was above the 0.1 cancer cases/100,000 individuals/75 years. Altogether the evaluation reveals the urgency for risk management of AfB1 in Indonesia.","Nugraha A, Khotimah K, Rietjens IMCM",Food Chem Toxicol,2018 Mar,Cancer AND Indonesia
27509956,HealthCare Providers' and Parents' Perspectives on Complementary Alternative Medicine in Children with Cancer in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Complementary alternative medicine (CAM) use in children with cancer is widespread. Health care providers (HCP) need to acknowledge and address this need. This study explored and compared perspectives on CAM of HCP and parents of young patients with cancer in Indonesia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a crosssectional study using semistructured questionnaires in HCP and parents of childhood cancer patients at an Indonesian academic hospital. RESULTS: A total of 351 respondents participated: 175 HCP (response rate 80%) and 176 parents (response rate 80%). Parents were more likely than HCP to think that chemotherapy can cure cancer (80% compared to 69%, P=0.013). Nearly half of all parents (46%) and HCP (45%) doubted whether CAM can cure cancer. Parents were more likely than HCP to think that CAM can be helpful in childhood cancer treatment (54% compared to 35%, P=0.003). The most recommended CAM by HCP was selfprayer (93%). Reasons for recommending CAM were: hope for improvement of the child's condition (48%), patient wants to stop treatment (42%). Most discouraged CAM by HCP was by oldsmart people (70%), the reasons being: lack of evidence for usefulness (77%), lack of CAM knowledge (75%). The proportion thinking that patients were unlikely to raise the CAM topic if they perceived that doctors were skeptical was higher in parents than in HCP (52% versus 1%) (P<0.001). Most HCP (71%) and parents (77%) acknowledged that their knowledge about safety and efficacy of CAM was inadequate (P=ns). The proportion that wanted to learn or read more about CAM was higher among parents than HCP (48% compared to 31%, P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: HCP and parents have different perspectives on CAM use in children with cancer. HCP should enhance their CAM knowledge and encourage open communication about CAM with parents. If doctors' skepticism is perceived, parents are unlikely to raise CAM as a topic.","Susilawati D, Sitaresmi M, Handayani K, Ven Pv, Sutaryo, Kaspers G, Mostert S",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2016,Cancer AND Indonesia
26274831,Comparing Health-Care Providers' Perspectives on Complementary and Alternative Medicine in Childhood Cancer Between Netherlands and Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is common among patients with childhood cancer. Health-care providers (HCP) should address this need properly. Geographical and cultural differences seem likely. This study explores perspectives on CAM of HCP involved in the care of children with cancer in Netherlands and Indonesia. Health beliefs, components of CAM, encouraging or discouraging CAM, and knowledge about CAM were assessed. PROCEDURE: We conducted a cross-sectional study using semi-structured questionnaires at a Dutch and Indonesian academic hospital. RESULTS: A total of 342 HCP participated: 119 Dutch (response rate 80%) and 223 Indonesian (response rate 87%). Chemotherapy can cure cancer according to more Dutch than Indonesian HCP (87% vs. 53% respectively, P < 0.001). Combination of chemotherapy and CAM is the best way to cure cancer according to more Indonesian than Dutch HCP (45% vs. 25%, P < 0.001). Dutch and Indonesian HCP recommend and discourage CAM use differently. Most Dutch (77%) and Indonesian HCP (84%) consider their knowledge about CAM to be inadequate (P = ns). Fewer Dutch doctors than other HCP want to learn more about CAM (51% vs. 76%, P = 0.007), whereas there is no significant difference in eagerness to learn about CAM between Indonesian doctors (64%) and other HCP (72%). CONCLUSIONS: Indonesian HCP have more positive views about CAM than their Dutch colleagues. Both Dutch and Indonesian HCP consider their knowledge about CAM to be inadequate. Therefore, education programs about CAM tailored to the needs of HCP are recommended, knowing that CAM is used frequently.","Gunawan S, Arnoldussen M, Gordijn MS, Sitaresmi MN, van de Ven PM, Ten Broeke CA, Veerman AJ, Mantik M, Kaspers GJ, Mostert S",Pediatr Blood Cancer,2016 Jan,Cancer AND Indonesia
23718197,"Evaluation of a 5-year cervical cancer prevention project in Indonesia: opportunities, issues, and challenges.","AIM: The Cervical and Breast Cancer Prevention (CECAP) Project sought to develop a national model for cervical cancer prevention in Indonesia based on visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) to detect abnormal changes in the cervix. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a pilot project introducing VIA and cryotherapy in Indonesia and to identify lessons learned that could be applied to the national scale-up of cervical cancer prevention services. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-four months (July 2007 to December 2011) of service records at 17 health centers were abstracted and analyzed. The data were used to calculate the proportion of all women aged 30-50 who received VIA screening, the VIA-positive rate, the treatment rate, and the interval between screening and treatment. RESULTS: The 45 050 women screened during the project included 24.4% of the total female population in the target age group in the catchment area. Throughout the 5-year project, 83.1% of VIA-positive women sought cryotherapy. During the last 18 months of the project, after data collection tools were revised to more accurately reflect when cryotherapy was received, 13% of women were treated on the same day that they were screened. Among the 74% of women treated within 1 month of screening, the mean interval between screening and treatment was 7.2 days. CONCLUSION: As cervical cancer prevention services are scaled up throughout Indonesia, changes in the service delivery model and program management are needed to increase screening coverage, promote a single-visit approach, and ensure the quality of services.","Kim YM, Lambe FM, Soetikno D, Wysong M, Tergas AI, Rajbhandari P, Ati A, Lu E",J Obstet Gynaecol Res,2013 Jun,Cancer AND Indonesia

METHODS: Fifty-three CRC samples were collected from January to September 2022 in the Department of Surgery, Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia. KRAS mutations were analyzed using PCR followed by Sanger sequencing. Associations between KRAS mutations were evaluated using binary logistic regression analysis. RESULT: KRAS mutations were detected in 52.8% of patients (n=28), of which 3.6% were p.Gly12Ser (n=1), 32.1% were p.Gly12Asp (n=9), 7.1% were p.Gly13Asp (n=2), 3.6% were p.Gln61His (n=1), 3.6% were p.Asp126His (n=1), and 3.6% were p.Lys169Glu (n=1). The p.Asp73= polymorphism was detected in 57.1% of the samples (n=16). KRAS mutation status did not differ significantly between the groups based on the age of onset, sex, tumor location, tumor histology, stage, and family history. CONCLUSION: KRAS mutations are present in high frequency in this cohort of CRC patients in a tertiary hospital in West Java, Indonesia. However, KRAS mutation status is not associated with the age of onset, sex, tumor location, tumor histology, stage, and family history.","Rudiman R, Alfarisy AN, Lukman K, Nugraha P, Setiawan Y, Sribudiani Y",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2024 Oct 1,Cancer AND Indonesia
34350153,Laboratory Readiness and Response for SARS-Cov-2 in Indonesia.,"The laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection comprises the informational cornerstone in the effort to contain the infections. Therefore, the ability to leverage laboratories' capacity in diagnostic testing and to increase the number of people being tested are critical. This paper reviews the readiness of Indonesian laboratories during the early months of the pandemic. It discusses the success of cross-sectoral collaboration among previously siloed national and sub-national government institutions, international development agencies, and private sector stakeholders. This collaboration managed to scale-up the COVID-19 referral laboratory network from one Ministry of Health NIHRD laboratory in the capital to 685 laboratories across 34 provinces. However, this rapid growth within 12 months since the first Indonesian case was discovered remained insufficient to cater for the constantly surging testing demands within the world's fourth most populous country. Reflecting on how other countries built their current pandemic preparedness from past emergencies, this paper highlights challenges and opportunities in workforce shortage, logistic distribution, and complex administration that need to be addressed.","Aisyah DN, Mayadewi CA, Igusti G, Manikam L, Adisasmito W, Kozlakidis Z",Front Public Health,2021,Cancer AND Indonesia
30256562,BRCA1 Promoter Methylation and Clinicopathological Characteristics in Sporadic Breast Cancer Patients in Indonesia.,"Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the BRCA1 promoter methylation and clinicopathological characteristics in sporadic breast cancer patients in Indonesia. Methods: In this cohort study, we selected 90 patients with stage I-III who had definitive surgery at our institution in 2011-2014. Demographic and clinical data regarding pathological stage, breast cancer treatment, outcome etc. were collected from the medical records. Twelve patients had incomplete information on follow up and 18 samples had insufficient tissues for the experiment. Sixty patients with adequate cancer tissues and complete follow up record were analyzed, only 56 patients were analyzed because 4 samples mRNA expression could not be detected. The Mann-Whitney U tests for non-normally distributed groups were used to compare the levels expression of BRCA1 mRNA between methylated and non-methylated samples. Chi-square tests were used to compare methylation status, BRCA1 mRNA expression and clinicopathological characteristics. P value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant correlation. Data analysis was held by using the GraphPad PRISM 7 (GraphPad Software Inc., USA). Results: DNA and RNA were isolated from primary tumor tissues of 56 breast cancer patients. BRCA1 promoter methylation was detected in 48 of 56 patients (85%). Level of BRCA1 mRNA expression was associated with decreased methylation level in the BRCA1 promoter regions suggesting the role of epigenetic silencing. However, there was no statistically significant association among methylation levels, BRCA1 mRNA transcript level with clinicopathological factors. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating methylation status and level of BRCA1 mRNA transcripts among breast cancer patients in Indonesia. We found that the prevalence of BRCA1 promoter methylation is higher than other studies from different populations. However, further investigation involving larger number of patients is required.","Harahap WA, Sudji IR, Nindrea RD",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2018 Sep 26,Cancer AND Indonesia
25819225,Asbestos in Asia.,"Asbestos is a global killer. Despite lessons learned in the developed world on the use of asbestos and its hazardous pulmonary consequences, its use continues to increase in Asia. Although some countries such as Japan, Korea and Singapore have curtailed the use of this mineral, there are numerous countries in Asia that continue to mine, import and use this fibre, particularly China, which is one of the largest consumers in the world. Numerous factors ranging from political and economic to the lack of understanding of asbestos and the management of asbestos-related lung disease are keys to this observed trend. Awareness of these factors combined with early intervention may prevent the predicted Asian 'tsunami' of asbestos diseases.","Leong SL, Zainudin R, Kazan-Allen L, Robinson BW",Respirology,2015 May,Cancer AND Indonesia
30049196,Estimating the Burden of Cancer and Treatment Cost Related to Alcohol Consumption in Indonesia: a Descriptive Study.,"Background: Alcohol consumption has become one of the most common cancer risk factors after smoking. Nowadays, estimation of the burden of disease attributable to alcohol has become standard in documenting the impact of health problems, but it has been rarely performed in Indonesia. The aim of this study was to estimate treatment cost of cancer related to alcohol consumption among the Indonesian population. Methods: This research design was descriptive with a prevalence-based approach using secondary data. Proportions of cancers were calculated using an alcohol-attributable fractions (AAF) formula. Treatment costs for eight types of cancer were assessed according to average treatment cost per patient from the national universal health coverage database for 2016. Result: The top three AAFs for males were cancers of the pharynx, esophagus and larynx (17.5%, 15.3% and 7.98%, respectively), while in females they were cancers of the esophagus, pharynx and stomach (2.15%; 1.39%; 0.83%). Among the eight types of cancer studied, the highest incidence in males was noted for liver cancer (132 cases) while colorectal cancer was the most common among females (31 cases). Treatment cost for cancers related to alcohol consumption were highest for colorectak cancer followed by laryngeal and liver cancer (116,083, 98,325 and 93,253 USD, respectively. Conclusion: The expenditure for treatment of cancers related to alcohol consumption accounts for about 1.71% of total cancer treatment cost. Since cancers related to alcohol consumption can be considered having an economic impact in Indonesia, it becomes important for the government to control alcohol consumption so that related healthcare expenditure can be minimized.","Kristina SA, Endarti D, Wiedyaningsih C, Yuliawati AN, Astyamalia S",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2018 Jul 27,Cancer AND Indonesia
39823501,Investigation of the trends and associated factors of ovarian cancer in Indonesia: A systematic analysis of the Global Burden of Disease study 1990-2021.,"INTRODUCTION: Ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal gynecological cancers. Despite diagnosis and treatment advances, survival rates have not increased over the past 32 years. This study estimated and reported the global burden of ovarian cancer during the past 32 years to inform preventative and control strategies. METHODS: We examined ovarian cancer incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) using age-standardized rates from the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2021. high body mass index and occupational asbestos exposure were linked with death and DALYs. Data are presented as averages with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). RESULTS: Indonesia had 13 250 (8 574-21 565) ovarian cancer cases in 2021, with 5 296 (3 520-8958) deaths and 186 917 (121 866-309 820) DALYs. The burden increased by 233.53% for new cases, 221.95% for mortalities, and 206.65% for DALYs. The age-standardized rate also increased from 1990 to 2021. Ovarian cancer burden increased with age but declined in the 50+ year age group. According to the sociodemographic index, the gross domestic product per capita and number of obstetricians and oncologic gynecologists in provinces showed different trends. CONCLUSIONS: Indonesian ovarian cancer rates are rising despite gynecologic oncologists in 24 of 34 provinces. These findings will help policymakers and healthcare providers identify ovarian cancer prevention and control gaps.","Tjokroprawiro BA, Novitasari K, Ulhaq RA, Sulistya HA, Martini S",PLoS One,2025,Cancer AND Indonesia
22938483,"Influencing women's actions on cervical cancer screening and treatment in Karawang District, Indonesia.","INTRODUCTION: The impact of cervical cancer prevention programs depends on persuading women to go for screening and, if needed, treatment. As part of an evaluation of a pilot project in Indonesia, qualitative research was conducted to explore the factors that influence women's decisions regarding screening and treatment and to generate practical recommendations to increase service coverage and reduce loss to follow up. METHODS: Research was conducted at 7 of the 17 public health centers in Karawang District that implemented the pilot project. Interviews and focus group discussions were held with 20 women, 20 husbands, 10 doctors, 18 midwives, 3 district health officials, and 16 advocacy team members. RESULTS: Free services and mobile outreach events encouraged women to go for screening, along with promotional efforts by community health workers, advocacy teams, and the mass media. Knowledge and perceptions were the most important barriers to screening: women were not aware of cervical cancer risks, did not know the disease was treatable, and were fatalistic. Factors facilitating treatment were social support from husbands, relatives, and friends and the encouragement and role modeling of health workers. Barriers to prompt treatment included limited access to services and the requirement for husband's consent for cryotherapy. CONCLUSION: As cervical cancer prevention services are scaled up throughout Indonesia, the findings suggest three strategies to expand screening coverage and ensure prompt treatment: strengthening community mobilization and advocacy activities, modifying the service delivery model to encourage a single visit approach to screening and treatment, and working to gain men's support.","Kim YM, Ati A, Kols A, Lambe FM, Soetikno D, Wysong M, Tergas AI, Rajbhandari P, Lu E",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2012,Cancer AND Indonesia
39693328,FoRSHE-X digital health intervention to improve the quality of life during chemotherapy among gynecological cancer survivors in Indonesia: A protocol for a pilot and feasibility study.,"Most Indonesian gynecological cancer survivors have unmet supportive care needs during chemotherapy, which may lower their quality of life and discontinue the treatment. Digital health intervention can address this issue. This pilot investigation aims to (1) examine the feasibility and acceptability of a Fighting on distRess, Self-efficacy, Health Effects, and seXual issues (FoRSHE-X) intervention and (2) evaluate prospectively the impact of the study implementation on the level of distress, self-efficacy, side effects' knowledge and management, and sexual quality of life using the RE-AIM (Reach Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework. This is a non-randomized mixed-methods pilot study. We will recruit women diagnosed with gynecological cancer undergoing chemotherapy to participate in the FoRSHE-X intervention consisting of ten weeks of social media-based education and telecoaching. We will evaluate the primary outcomes of study feasibility and acceptability, and the secondary outcomes of study impacts at three time points with quantitative and qualitative inquiries. We anticipate a minimum of 30 participants to enroll in the study and complete the assessment. We will disseminate results through conferences and peer-reviewed scientific journals. This study will imply whether a definitive trial to evaluate the potential benefits of the FoRSHE-X is viable and how it should proceed.

14728585,Gastro-intestinal cancer in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Report on cancer incidence in Indonesia was presented in relative frequency. To lower the bias, the report has been presented in age standardized cancer ratio (ASCAR). The report was a department of pathology based cancer registration. The ASCAR of gastro intestinal cancer in Indonesia has some variation between pathologic centres. The incidence of rectal cancer in Jogjakarta was higher than colon cancer, and stomach cancer is very low. The risk factors of stomach cancer are H. Pylori infection and food consumption especially salt and the risk factor of colorectal cancer is food consumption. PURPOSE: The article will discuss the ASCAR of stomach and colorectal cancer in Indonesia. The histopathologic of stomach and colorectal cancer in Jogjakarta will be presented from the view point of pathology. METHODS: Stomach and colorectal cancer data from 13 pathologic diagnostic centres in Indonesia were collected. The pathogenesis of stomach and colorectal cancer will be discussed in correlation with the cancer prevention. RESULTS: The incidence of stomach cancer in many centres in the year of 1996 are very low from 0,00% - 0,24 % for the most lowest incidence and 2.22 % - 5.60 % for the highest incidence. The higher incidence of stomach cancer was in Medan 19 males (5.6%); 10 females (2.22%); Palembang 7 males (4.75%), 1 female (0.11%); Surabaya 18 males (1.38%), 7 females (0.35%); Denpasar 12 males (2.97%), 1 female (0.24%), and Jakarta 55 males (4%), 28 females (1.39%). The incidence of colorectal cancer is almost equal in every pathologic diagnostic centres. It is interesting that the incidence of rectal cancer was higher than colon cancer. In Jogjakarta the histopathological feature of stomach cancer was predominated by poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, while colorectal cancer was predominated by well differentiated adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: The low incidence of gastric cancer in Indonesia in relation with H. Pylori and food consumption and the high ratio between rectal and colon cancer in correlation with the food consumption and it pathogenesis need further investigation.","Soeripto, Indrawati, Indrayanti",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2003 Aug-Dec,Cancer AND Indonesia
37642061,Early Detection of Breast Cancer in Indonesia: Barriers Identified in a Qualitative Study.,"BACKGROUND: The lack of early detection in breast cancer management has been identified as the primary factor contributing to the high mortality rate. The introduction of BPJS Kesehatan, Indonesia's national health insurance, was intended to ensure the provision of adequate health services for breast cancer patients. This study aimed to investigate the current state of health services in Indonesia concerning the early detection of breast cancer, following the implementation of BPJS Kesehatan introduction. METHODS: The study was conducted in 2017 in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Subjects were recruited using a purposive sampling technique with maximum variation. The sample comprised breast cancer patients, health care professionals (HCPs), and healthy women from the general population with no history of breast cancer. The subjects' experiences and knowledge of health services regarding the early detection of breast cancer were investigated through in-depth interviews. Thematic analysis was used to synthesize the results from interviews with 25 participants. RESULT: This study identified several issues that hinder the timely detection of breast cancer. The lack of both screening and diagnostic procedures emerged as a prominent obstacle in breast cancer management. The study identified the following barriers: (1) limited community knowledge about early detection; (2). lack of urgency among patients to seek medical treatment; (3) limited access to health facilities; and (4) inconsistent adherence among health care professionals to guidelines for both screening and diagnostic procedures. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed multiple factors contributing to the delay in breast cancer detection in Indonesia, leading to suboptimal management of the disease. It is crucial for the government to prioritize the improvement of enabling factors across all levels of care for early detection. These factors include initiatives to increase public awareness, improve access to health services, strengthen the referral system, and enhance health facilities.","Icanervilia AV, Choridah L, Van Asselt ADI, Vervoort JPM, Postma MJ, Rengganis AA, Kardinah K",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2023 Aug 1,Cancer AND Indonesia
8462315,Oral contraceptive use and breast cancer in Indonesia.,"A hospital-based case-control study was conducted in Ujungpandang, Indonesia, to determine the association of breast cancer and current and former oral contraceptive (OC) use. This study included 119 newly diagnosed, histologically-confirmed, breast cancer cases who were admitted to the four largest referral hospitals in Ujungpandang from 1990-1991. Controls were 258 women admitted to these same four hospitals with diagnoses unrelated to breast cancer or OC use. Thirty cases (32%) and 55 (19%) controls reported having ever used OCs. The odds ratio for ever using OCs and breast cancer was 1.8 (95% confidence interval 1.2-3.0) after adjustment for age, age at first pregnancy, and family history of breast cancer. Increasing duration of OC use did not increase risk of breast cancer. No latency trend of increasing years since first OC use among cases was observed; however, a younger age at first OC use was associated with increasing breast cancer risk. A significant recency effect was observed; women last using OCs within five years of study enrollment were at greatest risk of breast cancer (OR = 4.9, 95% CI: 2.1-11.4). This first study of breast cancer and OC use in Indonesia does not provide consistent data to indicate an increased risk of breast cancer associated with OC use. Although breast cancer cases were 80% more likely to have ever used OCs, neither duration nor latency of OC use were associated with cancer risk. The significant recency effect suggests that a detection bias might explain the observed relationship between ever OC use and breast cancer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Bustan MN, Coker AL, Addy CL, Macera CA, Greene F, Sampoerno D",Contraception,1993 Mar,Cancer AND Indonesia

A descriptive qualitative approach was used in this study. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 nurses recruited using purposive sampling. The data were analyzed using an inductive semantic approach. Thematic analysis identified that nurses possess limited knowledge of CAM. Nurses were skeptical toward CAM and less confident to recommend its use. Four main themes (and two subthemes) emerged: Understanding of CAM, Hesitative Attitudes, Personal Experience, and Preferences in Learning about CAM. There is a need to integrate CAM topics into nursing education programs in order to develop nurses' knowledge and build positive attitudes toward CAM use. Sufficient knowledge and positive attitudes toward CAM would support safety and quality of care in management of patients with cancer who use or are contemplating using CAM.","Christina J, Abigail W, Cuthbertson LA, Whitehead D",J Holist Nurs,2019 Jun,Cancer AND Indonesia
37487234,Economic and humanistic burden of HPV-related disease in Indonesia: A qualitative analysis.,"The burden of human papillomavirus (HPV) and HPV-related cancers and genital warts is increasing in developing countries, including Indonesia. The objective of this study was to qualitatively explore the humanistic and economic burden of these HPV-related diseases in patients in Indonesia. In 2021, in-depth interviews and focus groups were conducted with patients (N = 18) with HPV-related diseases and healthcare professionals (HCPs; N = 10) specialised in treating these patients. Interviews explored the physical, mental, social, and economic burden of HPV-related diseases. Patients emphasised the psychological and social burden of HPV-related diseases, which negatively impacted their mental state and close relationships. Treatment for HPV-related diseases was also associated with a substantial cost, which health insurance only partially alleviated. HCPs understood the physical negative impact of HPV-related diseases, but some understated patients' social, psychological, and financial burden. This research underscores the substantial economic and humanistic burden of HPV-related diseases that could be prevented by vaccination. In addition, it highlights the need for novel interventions to reduce negative psychosocial consequences of HPV-related diseases in Indonesia. Increased HCP education of the broader humanistic impacts of HPV-related diseases may improve patient support and increase awareness for preventive strategy.","Felsher M, Setiawan D, Varga S, Perry R, Riley D, Newman R, Beveridge A, Oswald C, Kothari S, Sukarom I, Postma M",Glob Public Health,2023 Jan,Cancer AND Indonesia
35696384,The incidence and mortality of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Indonesia: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of childhood ALL in Indonesia is still largely unknown. The widely mentioned statistics from other countries turn out to be only estimated figures. Other data do not specify the types of leukemia and are not specifically focused on children. Therefore, this study aims to pool incidence and mortality statistics from available studies in Indonesia. METHODS: We searched five different academic databases, including Pubmed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. Three Indonesian databases, such as the Indonesian Scientific Journal Database (ISJD), Neliti, and Indonesia One Search, were also utilized. Incidence was expressed as per 100,000 children. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) to assess the quality of cohort studies. The inclusion criteria are cohort studies published in the languages of English or Indonesian. For this analysis, we define children as 0-18 years old. FINDINGS: The incidence rate for childhood ALL was found to be 4.32 per 100,000 children (95% CI 2.65-5.99) with a prediction interval of 1.98 to 9.42 per 100,000 children. The incidence rate is higher in males, with 2.45 per 100,000 children (95% CI 1.98-2.91) and a prediction interval of 1.90 to 3.16 per 100,000 children. As for females, the incidence rate is 2.05 per 100,000 children (95% CI 1.52-2.77) with a prediction interval of 1.52 to 2.77 per 100,000 children. The mortality of childhood ALL ranges from 0.44 to 5.3 deaths per 100,000 children, while the CFR is 3.58% with varying true effect sizes of 2.84% to 4.52%. INTERPRETATION: With 79.5 million children living in Indonesia in 2018, this means that there were roughly 3,434 new cases of childhood ALL. An organized effort between multiple sectors is needed to improve the registries of childhood ALL in Indonesia.","Garniasih D, Susanah S, Sribudiani Y, Hilmanto D",PLoS One,2022,Cancer AND Indonesia

22393968,"Comparison of breast cancer in Indonesia and Malaysia--a clinico-pathological study between Dharmais Cancer Centre Jakarta and University Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur.","INTRODUCTION: The age standardised incidence rate (ASR) of breast cancer in Malaysia which is a high middle- income country is similar to Indonesia, a low middle-income country. (Globocan 2008) It is however unknown whether the presentation of breast cancer differs between these two countries. OBJECTIVE: We compared the stage, age at presentation, and pathological characteristics of breast cancer between two tertiary hospitals in Indonesia and Malaysia; Dharmais Cancer Centre (DCC), which is the national cancer referral centre in Indonesia, and University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC), which is an academic hospital with established breast oncology services in Kuala Lumpur. One thousand, one hundred and fourteen consecutive women (477 in UMMC: 637 in DCC) who were newly diagnosed with breast cancer between January and December, 2010 were included. Patient's age, TNM stage at presentation, and pathological characteristics were compared. Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) were considered positive if 10% or greater of invasive cell nuclei were stained while HER2 was considered positive with an immunohistochemistry staining intensity of 3+ . Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify differences. RESULTS: Median age at diagnosis was 52 years in UMMC and 47 years in DCC, whereby patients in DCC were more likely to be very young at diagnosis (aged < 35 years) compared to their counterparts in UMMC (Odds ratio (OR): 2.09; 95%CI: 1.32-3.31). Approximately one third of patients in UMMC presented with TNM stage III or IV, compared to 63% in DCC. Patients in DCC were three times more likely to present with metastatic breast cancer compared to patients in UMMC (OR: 3.01; 95% CI: 2.02-4.48). The percentage of low grade tumours in DCC was higher than in UMMC (28% vs 11% respectively), and the difference persisted even after multivariate adjustment. Although the frequency of ER and PR positivity appeared to be higher in UMMC (65% and 55% respectively) compared to DCC (48% and 40% respectively), these differences were not statistically significant following adjustment for age, stage, HER2 status and grade. The frequency of HER2 positivity was 45% in DCC compared to 26% in UMMC, and remained significantly higher even after multivariate adjustment (multivariate OR:1.76; 95%CI:1.25-2.47, in DCC compared to UMMC). The proportion of triple negative breast cancer was however similar in the two centres (19% in UMMC vs 21% in DCC). CONCLUSION: Indonesian women with breast cancer seem to present at a younger age and at later stages compared to Malaysian women. Their tumors were more likely to be of low grade and HER2 positive, even after adjustment for other factors, while hormone receptor positivity proved similar in the two groups. The higher HER2 positivity rate in Indonesian patients warrants further study.","Ng CH, Pathy NB, Taib NA, Teh YC, Mun KS, Amiruddin A, Evlina S, Rhodes A, Yip CH",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2011,Cancer AND Indonesia
29506486,Determinants of cancer screening awareness and participation among Indonesian women.,"BACKGROUND: Cancer screening awareness and participation may be lower in low- and middle-income countries that lack established national screening programmes compared with those that do. We evaluated potential determinants of awareness about and participation in breast and cervical cancer screening, and breast self-examination (BSE) in women using survey data from Indonesia. METHODS: From the fifth Indonesian Family Life Survey (2014-2015), a total of 5397 women aged 40 and older without any history of cancer who responded to questionnaires concerning Pap smears, mammography, and BSE were included. Multilevel modelling was used to assess potential determinants in relation to awareness about Pap smears and mammography, and participation in Pap smears and BSE practice. Multivariable analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of cancer screening. RESULTS: Of the 5397 respondents, 1058 (20%) women were aware of Pap smears, of which 297 had never had the procedure. Only 251 (5%) participants were aware of mammography. A total of 605 (12%) of women reported they performed BSE. Higher education and household expenditure were consistently associated with higher odds of awareness about Pap smears and mammography (e.g. odds ratio [OR] of being aware of Pap smear and mammography: 7.82 (95% CI: 6.30-9.70) and 7.70 (6.19-9.58), respectively, for high school graduates compared to women with less educational attainment in the multivariable models), and participation in Pap smears and BSE. We also identified enabling factors linked with greater cancer screening awareness and participation, including health insurance, shorter distance to health services, and social participation. CONCLUSION: There are socioeconomic disparities in cancer screening awareness and participation among Indonesian women. Our findings may help inform targeted health promotion and screening for cancer in the presence of limited resources.","Anwar SL, Tampubolon G, Van Hemelrijck M, Hutajulu SH, Watkins J, Wulaningsih W",BMC Cancer,2018 Mar 6,Cancer AND Indonesia
27221905,"Predictors of Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use by Breast Cancer Patients in Bandung, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: The study aimed to assess complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use and their associated factors with breast cancer patients in Bandung, Indonesia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 330 breast cancer patients were administered questionnaires on their CAM use and CAM predictive factors including socio-demographic parameters, clinical data and quality of life, trust in physicians, trust in hospitals, satisfaction and informational needs. Data were analyzed using univariate analysis and multivariate log regreesion analysis. RESULTS: Overall 33.3% of patients reported use of CAM. Lower income, lower education, presence of metastasis, prolonged diagnosis, less trust in physician were found to be highly associated with CAM use. CONCLUSIONS: CAM use by breast cancer patients can be interpreted as an attempt to explore all possible options, an expression of an active coping style, or expression of unmet needs in the cancer care continuum. Physicians need to openly discuss the use of CAM with their patients and identify whether they have other unmet supportive needs.","Azhar Y, Achmad D, Lukman K, Hilmanto D, Aryandono T",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2016,Cancer AND Indonesia

One hundred unrelated breast cancer patients were interviewed to obtain clinical symptoms and signs, pedigree and familial history of HBOC syndrome related cancer. Subsequently, data were calculated using the Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm (BOADICEA) risk prediction model. Patients with high score of BOADICEA were offered genetic testing. Eleven patients with high score of BOADICEA, 2 patients with low score of BOADICEA, 2 patient's family members and 15 controls underwent BRCA1 genetic testing. Mutation screening using PCR-HRM was carried out in 22 exons (41 amplicons) of BRCA1 gene. Sanger sequencing was subjected in all samples with aberrant graph. This study identified 10 variants in the BRCA1 gene, consisting of 6 missense mutations (c.1480C>A, c.2612C>T, c.2566T>C, c.3113A>G, c.3548 A>G, c.4837 A>G), 3 synonymous mutations (c.2082 C> T, c.2311 T> C and c.4308T>C) and one intronic mutation (c.134+35 G>T).

24799294,"Dealing with symptoms and issues of hospitalized patients with cancer in indonesia: the role of families, nurses, and physicians.","OBJECTIVE: Patients with cancer often face physical, psychological, social, spiritual, and emotional symptoms. Our aim was to study symptoms and issues of hospitalized patients with cancer in Indonesia, a country with strong family ties, and how family members, nurses, and physicians deal with them. METHODS: In 2011, 150 hospitalized cancer patients in 3 general hospitals in Indonesia were invited to fill in a questionnaire, which was based on the validated Problems and Needs of Palliative Care (short version) questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were performed. RESULTS: Of 119 patients (79%) who completed the questionnaire, 85% stated that their symptoms and issues were addressed. According to these patients, financial (56%), autonomy (36%), and psychosocial (34%) issues were most often addressed by the family alone. Physical symptoms (52%) and spiritual issues (33%) were addressed mainly by a combination of family, nurses, and physicians. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized patients with cancer in Indonesia felt that most of their symptoms and issues had been addressed, and the family was highly involved. The strong family ties in Indonesian culture may have contributed to this family role. More research is needed to clarify how this influences patient outcome, quality of care, and quality of life of both the patients and their families, along with the degree of partnership between families and professionals. This information might help answer the question what advantages and disadvantages the family role in caring for a hospitalized patient with cancer generates for the patient, the family, and professional caregivers.","Effendy C, Vissers K, Tejawinata S, Vernooij-Dassen M, Engels Y",Pain Pract,2015 Jun,Cancer AND Indonesia
24716920,"Profile and survival of tongue cancer patients in ""Dharmais"" Cancer Hospital, Jakarta.","BACKGROUND: Tongue cancer is still a major health problem in most developing countries around the world. Statistics shown the number of tongue cancers, especially in early age, to be increasing, with poor survival. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the characteristic profile of tongue cancer patients in Indonesia as well as the survival rate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted in Dharmais National Cancer Hospital by collecting general, clinical, and survival data of tongue cancer patients from medical records for January 2009 to April 2012. RESULTS: Tongue cancer incidence increased year by year. The average age of tongue cancer patients was 47.5 years, and males predominated, accounting for 64.5% of cases. Most patients presented at an advanced stage (69.6%). The histopathology type was squamous cell carcinoma in the vast majoriy (96.8%). The therapies applied were surgery (45.6%), radiation (63.6%) and chemotherapy (57.6%). The survival rate after one year is 60.6% and after two years was 12.1%. In addition, median survival of tongue cancer patients was 20 months (95% confidence interval 9.07-30.9). The significant factor affecting survival was size of tumor with a hazard ratio of 3.18 (95% CI, 1.02-9.93; p 0.046) for largest versus smallest categories. CONCLUSIONS: In each year, the number of tongue cancer incidents in Indonesia is increasing. The age of tongue cancer patients in Indonesia is younger compared to other countries. Moreover, the survival rates are not high.","Sutandyo N, Ramli R, Sari L, Soeis DS",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2014,Cancer AND Indonesia
19390128,Adrenal incidentaloma.,"Adrenal Incidentaloma is an adrenal tumor, which is unidentified before the imaging procedures conducted for an abnormality which is initially unforeseen as an adrenal disease. Symptoms and/or clinical signs of adrenal tumor do not have to be present prior to a diagnosis. Adrenal Incidentaloma can be divided into non-hypersecreting adrenal adenoma, hypersecreting tumor, primary adrenal carcinoma, other adrenal mass, and metastases. The majority of adrenal tumor is non-hypersecreting adrenal adenoma, but it is always considered as hypersecreting tumor until proven otherwise. Some conditions that can be found due to hormonal activity of adrenal incidentaloma is subclinical Cushing's syndrome, pheochromocytoma, aldosteronoma (Conn's disease), and several tumors which secrete androgen and sex hormone. Diagnostic approach of adrenal incidentaloma is focused on two main problems, which are, whether the lesion is hormonally active even though lacking characteristic clinical signs, and whether the lesion is benign or malignant; thus it needs hormonal and radiologic evaluation, even a fine needle biopsy. The management for adrenal incidentaloma includes surgical removal for hormonally active adrenal tumors, or inactive tumors with size less than 4 cm. Monitoring of tumor's hormone level and size are necessary for non-hypersecreting tumor without surgical removal.","Ridho FE, Adam FM, Adam JM",Acta Med Indones,2009 Apr,Cancer AND Indonesia
22799393,Population-based cancer registration in Indonesia.,"Cancer is a major public health problem in Indonesia, becoming the 7th largest cause of death based on a national survey in 2007, accounting for 5.7 of all mortality. A cancer registry was started in 1970, but it was partial and was stopped mainly because no government body was responsible. Realizing the above situation, the Indonesian government established the Sub Directorate of Cancer Control within the Ministry of Health, with responsibility for developing a national cancer control program, including a cancer registry. A sustainable cancer registry was then started in 2007 within Jakarta Province, first hospital-based but then expanded to be population-based. Steps of cancer registration in Jakarta are data collection, data verification, data validation, data management and analysis, and data publication. Data collection is conducted by health facilities (hospitals, laboratories, primary health centers) at the district/municipal level, with reports to the provincial level. Data are collected passively by holding meetings every three months in the district/municipality. Verification of data is the responsibility of the medical doctor or pathologist in each data source. Data validation is conducted by a team in the cancer registry, consisting of district/municipal/province health officers, pathologists, and registrars. Data management and analyses are conducted by a cancer registry team at the provincial level, assisted by the national team. We use software named Indonesian Cancer Registry System (SRIKANDI) which is adopted from CanReg4 IARC. Data from the population-based cancer registry in Jakarta Province showed the leading cancers among females in 2005-2007 to be breast cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer and among males are bronchus and lung cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, pharyngeal cancer, and prostate cancer. The leading childhood cancers are leukaemia and retinoblastoma.","Wahidin M, Noviani R, Hermawan S, Andriani V, Ardian A, Djarir H",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2012,Cancer AND Indonesia
33539173,Five-Year Cancer Epidemiology at the National Referral Hospital: Hospital-Based Cancer Registry Data in Indonesia.,"PURPOSE: In 2016, there were 1,308,061 cases of cancer being treated in Indonesia, with 2.2 trillion rupiahs spent, amounting to $486,960,633 in US dollars (purchasing power parity 2016). The high burden of cancers in Indonesia requires a valid data collection to inform future cancer-related policies. The purpose of this study is to report cancer epidemiological data from 2008 to 2012 based on Hospital-Based Cancer Registry (HBCR) data from Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Indonesia. METHODS: This was a descriptive study with cross-sectional design. Data were collected from Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital HBCR 2008-2012. Demographical, diagnostic, stages of cancer, and histopathological types of cancer data were extracted. RESULTS: After screening, 18,216 cases were included. A total of 12,438 patients were older than 39 years of age (68.3%), with a female-to-male ratio of 9:5. Most patients have cancers at advanced stages (stages III and IV, 10.2%). The most common sites of cancer were cervix uteri (2,878 cases, 15.8%), breast (2,459 cases, 13.5%), hematopoietic and reticuloendothelial systems (1,422 cases, 7.8%), nasopharynx (1,338 cases, 7.4%), and lymph nodes (1,104 cases, 6.1%). CONCLUSION: From this HBCR, cancer incidence in female was almost twice the incidence in male, largely because of the burden of cervical and breast cancers. The cervix uteri as one of the top five cancer sites based on this HBCR, 2008-2012, are still approximately consistent with Global Cancer Incidence, Mortality and Prevalence 2018, which portrayed that Indonesia has been severely afflicted by cervical cancer cases more than any other Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries. The HBCR could serve as a robust database of epidemiological data for cancer cases in Indonesia.","Gondhowiardjo S, Christina N, Ganapati NPD, Hawariy S, Radityamurti F, Jayalie VF, Octavianus S, Prawira Putra A, Sekarutami SM, Prajogi GB, Giselvania A, Adham M, Hamid ARAH, Widyastuti E, Prabowo Y, Aninditha T, Purwoto G, Aman RA, Siregar TP, Siswoyo AD, Handjari DR, Atmakusuma D, Rajabto W, Mulansari NA, Ratna N, Pitoyo CW, Panigoro SS, Kartini D, Yulian ED, Andrisa RS, Jeo WS, Wardhani RK, Tambunan TFU, Agianda F",JCO Glob Oncol,2021 Feb,Cancer AND Indonesia
34621720,"Availability and Accessibility of Primary Care for the Remote, Rural, and Poor Population of Indonesia.","Background: Adopting Universal Health Coverage for implementation of a national health insurance system [Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN)/Badan Penyelenggara Jaminan Sosial or the Indonesian National Social Health Insurance Scheme (BPJS)] targets the 255 million population of Indonesia. The availability, accessibility, and acceptance of healthcare services are the most important challenges during implementation. Referral behavior and the utilization of primary care structures for underserved (rural/remote regions) populations are key guiding elements. In this study, we provided the first assessment of BPJS implementation and its resulting implications for healthcare delivery based on the entire insurance dataset for the initial period of implementation, specifically focusing on poor and remote populations. Methods: Demographic, economic, and healthcare infrastructure information was obtained from public resources. Data about the JKN membership structure, performance information, and reimbursement were provided by the BPJS national head office. For analysis, an ANOVA was used to compare reimbursement indexes for primary healthcare (PHC) and advanced healthcare (AHC). The usage of primary care resources was analyzed by comparing clustered provinces and utilization indices differentiating poor [Penerima Bantuan Iur (PBI) membership] and non-poor populations (non-PBI). Factorial and canonical discrimination analyses were applied to identify the determinants of PHC structures. Results: Remote regions cover 27.8% of districts/municipalities. The distribution of the poor population and PBI members were highly correlated (r(2) > 0.8; p < 0.001). Three clusters of provinces [remote high-poor (N = 13), remote low-poor (N = 15), non-remote (N = 5)] were identified. A discrimination analysis enabled the >82% correct cluster classification of infrastructure and human resources of health (HRH)-related factors. Standardized HRH (nurses and general practitioners [GP]) availability showed significant differences between clusters (p < 0.01), whereas the availability of hospital beds was weakly correlated. The usage of PHC was ~2-fold of AHC, while non-PBI members utilized AHC 4- to 5-fold more frequently than PBI members. Referral indices (r(2) = 0.94; p < 0.001) for PBI, non-PBI, and AHC utilization rates (r(2) = 0.53; p < 0.001) were highly correlated. Conclusion: Human resources of health availability were intensively related to the extent of the remote population but not the numbers of the poor population. The access points of PHC were mainly used by the poor population and in remote regions, whereas other population groups (non-PBI and non-Remote) preferred direct access to AHC. Guiding referral and the utilization of primary care will be key success factors for the effective and efficient usage of available healthcare infrastructures and the achievement of universal health coverage in Indonesia. The short-term development of JKN was recommended, with a focus on guiding referral behavior, especially in remote regions and for non-PBI members.","Wenang S, Schaefers J, Afdal A, Gufron A, Geyer S, Dewanto I, Haier J",Front Public Health,2021,Cancer AND Indonesia
19251469,"Dietary patterns and risk of oral cancer: a factor analysis study of a population in Jakarta, Indonesia.","A matched case-control, hospital-based study of oral cancer was conducted in Jakarta population. The sample included 81 cases and 162 controls. The purpose of this study was to determine the association between dietary pattern and oral cancer in a Jakarta population using factor analysis. Dietary data were collected using food frequency questionnaire and factor analysis was performed on 15 food groups resulting in four principle factors/components being retained. The first factor ""preferred"" was characterized by fast food, fermented food, canned food, snacks high in fat and sugar, cooked and raw vegetables, and seafood. The second factor labeled ""combination"" was loaded by the intake of dairy product, red meat, white meat and fruits. The third factor labeled ""chemical related was loaded by processed food and monosodium glutamate and the fourth principle component consisted of drinks and grain was labeled as ""traditional"". The conditional logistic regression was done using STATA 8 to obtain the odds ratio (OR) of highest tertile of each component retained from factor analysis and the ORs were then adjusted with risk habits. The consumption the highest tertile of the ""preferred"" pattern increased the risk of oral cancer by two-times compared to the lowest tertile of consumption [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=2.17; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.05-4.50]. The chemical related"" pattern showed higher risk of about threefold (aOR=2.56; 95% CI=1.18-5.54), while the ""traditional"" pattern showed an increased of risk by twofold (aOR=2.04; 95% CI=1.01-4.41). In contrast, the ""combination"" pattern displayed protective effects in relation to oral cancer (aOR=0.50; 95% CI=0.24-1.00). This finding suggests that factor analysis may be useful to determine the diet pattern of a big set of food type and establish the correlation with oral cancer.","Amtha R, Zain R, Razak IA, Basuki B, Roeslan BO, Gautama W, Purwanto DJ",Oral Oncol,2009 Aug,Cancer AND Indonesia
31653149,"Association Between Family Support, Coping Strategies and Anxiety in Cancer Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy at General Hospital in Medan, North Sumatera, Indonesia.","OBJECTIVE: This study aims to test the association between family support and coping strategies and anxiety at Dr. Pirngadi General Hospital Medan. METHODS: The study was a correlational descriptive study with a cross-sectional approach. The samples were 102 cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, who were selected through purposive sampling technique. Data was collected using a family support questionnaire instrument developed based on the concept of the House and Friedman theory, a coping strategy questionnaire modified from the Revised Ways of Coping questionnaire by Folkman and Lazarus, and an anxiety questionnaire modified from the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A). Bivariate analysis was conducted using the Product Moment correlation coefficient to test the association between family support, coping strategies, and anxiety. Multivariate analysis was conducted using the logistic regression test to investigate dominant variables associated with coping strategies and anxiety. RESULTS: The results of the bivariate analysis showed a significant positive association (p=0.001) and strong correlation (r=0.612) between family support and Problem Focused Coping (PFC) strategy, while there was a significant negative association (p=0.001) and moderate correlation (r=-0.462) with the Emotion Focused Coping (EFC) strategy. A significant negative association (p=0.001) and strong correlation (r=-0.646) was found between family support and anxiety. The multivariate analysis showed a dominant association (p = 0.001) between family support with PFC strategy (OR = 12.2), EFC (OR = 0.142), and anxiety (OR = 0.039). CONCLUSION: Based on the results, it can be concluded that there was an association between good family support and effective coping strategies and lower anxiety levels in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. These results can be an input for health services to increase family support for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy in combination with effective coping strategies to decrease anxiety levels.","Sari DK, Dewi R, Daulay W",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2019 Oct 1,Cancer AND Indonesia
8754994,Indonesia: status of cancer pain and palliative care.,"Indonesia is a large archipelago with an estimated 203,000-365,400 new cancer cases a year. Most cases present in the advanced stage. Pain is the chief complaint in 89% of the patients of the palliative care unit at Dr. Soetomo hospital. The program is a community-based, family-oriented, and culturally adapted home care, widely applicable throughout the country. The service and medication should be affordable, simple, and available. The WHO three-step ladder has been adopted as the method of choice in cancer pain relief. Facilities supportive for the program are the existing health-care delivery system and non-formal support system (Indonesian Cancer Foundation and Organization for Family Welfare Promotion, PKK).

15297193,"Human papillomavirus type 16 E6, E7, and L1 variants in cervical cancer in Indonesia, Suriname, and The Netherlands.","OBJECTIVE: Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV 16) has several intratypic variants, and some are associated with enhanced oncogenic potential. For risk determination as well as for future vaccine development, knowledge about variants is important. Regarding the geographical distribution of HPV variants and the lack of data from Indonesia and Suriname, we studied the prevalence of HPV 16 variants in cervical cancer in these high incidence countries. Data were compared with The Netherlands, a low-risk country. METHODS: DNA samples from 74 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded HPV 16-positive cervical carcinomas from Indonesia (Java, N = 22), Suriname (N = 25), and The Netherlands (N = 27) were amplified using primers specific for the E6, E7, and part of the L1 regions. Products were sequenced and analyzed. RESULTS: A specific Javanese variant, with mutations 666A in E7 and 6826T in L1, was found in 73% of the Indonesian samples, 56% having an additional mutation in the E6 open reading frame (ORF; 276G), giving the predicted amino acid change N58S. This Javanese variant was also found in three Surinamese samples, which reflects what could be expected from migration of Javanese people to Surinam. Other non-European variants were identified in Indonesian, Surinamese, and Dutch samples in 14%, 28%, and 19%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The majority of the HPV 16-positive cervical cancers in Indonesia are caused by a specific intratypic variant that was rarely found before in other countries.","de Boer MA, Peters LA, Aziz MF, Siregar B, Cornain S, Vrede MA, Jordanova ES, Kolkman-Uljee S, Fleuren GJ",Gynecol Oncol,2004 Aug,Cancer AND Indonesia
38787899,Economic evaluation of trastuzumab in HER2-positive early breast cancer in Indonesia: A cost-effectiveness analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab has significantly enhanced the survival and prognosis of individuals diagnosed with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive early breast cancer. Considering its relatively high costs, we aimed to examine the cost-effectiveness of trastuzumab plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone in HER2-positive early breast cancer from an Indonesian healthcare payer's perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to project the lifetime health benefits and costs associated with trastuzumab treatment for a cohort of women with HER2-positive early breast cancer. Efficacy data and baseline characteristics in the base-case analysis were primarily derived from the 11-year results of the HERA trial. Costs were based on verified reimbursement data from Indonesia's Health and Social Security Agency (BPJS Kesehatan) of the year 2020. A scenario analysis was conducted with efficacy data based on the joint analysis from the NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831 trials, allowing for subgroup analysis by age at diagnosis. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the influence of parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the results indicated that the lifetime costs for trastuzumab plus chemotherapy and chemotherapy alone were US$33,744 and US$22,720, respectively, resulting in substantial incremental savings of US$11,024 per patient for the former. Trastuzumab plus chemotherapy also led to higher total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and life years gained (LYG), resulting in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of US$6,842 per QALY and US$5,510 per LYG. In scenario analysis, the subgroup with an age at diagnosis <40 years old reflected the most cost-effective subgroup. Both the base-case and scenario analyses demonstrated cost-effectiveness with a willingness-to-pay threshold of three-times Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the findings and conclusions. CONCLUSION: In Indonesia, trastuzumab plus chemotherapy can be considered cost-effective compared to chemotherapy alone at a willingness-to-pay threshold of three times GDP, and it is likely most cost-effective in women <40 years of age.","Khoirunnisa SM, Suryanegara FDA, Setiawan D, Postma MJ, de Jong LA",PLoS One,2024,Cancer AND Indonesia

METHODS: this is a cross-sectional study on 32 patients undergoing colonoscopy; 16 patients of colorectal cancer (CRC) while the other 16 patients are not (colitis and internal hemorrhoid). The composition of microbiota in stool samples was examined using 16S rRNA Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DDGE) while expression of HSP70 was examined by immunohistochemistry and Caspase-3 by using Haematoxylin-Eosin(HE) staining to determine the morphological changes in colon tissue. RESULTS: analysis of PCR-DDGE shows a different composition of microbiota between patients with CRC and non-CRC. All CRC patients showed disappearance of dominant band from Bifidobacterium groups. Histological observation based on Inter Class Correlation (ICC) test from all slide showed a high scores (5.2-9.2) in CRC patients and low scores (1.7-2.4) in non-CRC patients. HSP70 expression was increased significantly in CRC patients with the highest percentage of 84%, while expression of caspase-3 decreased with the highest percentage of 21%. Statistical analysis showed that the incidence of colorectal cancer was associated with the expression of HSP 70 (p<0.001), and Caspase 3 (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: bifidobacterium is an important indicator for colorectal cancer patients that show disappearance of dominant band, while expression of HSP70 increased and the Caspase-3 expression decreased significantly.","Yusuf F, Ilyas S, Damanik HA, Fatchiyah F",Acta Med Indones,2016 Oct,Cancer AND Indonesia

Indonesia is a country with a high cervical cancer incidence and with the world's highest prevalence of HPV 18 in cervical cancer. No information exists about the prevalence of HPV 18 or other HPV types in the Indonesian population. We conducted a hospital-based case-control study in Jakarta, Indonesia. A total of 74 cervical carcinoma cases and 209 control women, recruited from the gynecological outpatient clinic of the same hospital, were included. All women were HPV typed by the line probe assay, and interviews were obtained regarding possible risk factors for cervical cancer. HPV was detected in 95.9% of the cases and in 25.4% of the controls. In the control group, 13.4% was infected with a high-risk HPV type. HPV 16 was detected in 35% of the case group and in 1.9% of the control group and HPV 18 was identified in 28% of the case group and in 2.4% of the control group, suggesting that the oncogenic potentials of HPV 16 and HPV 18 in Indonesia are similar. In addition to HPV infection, young age at first intercourse, having a history of more than one sexual partner, and high parity were significant risk factors for cervical cancer. Within the control group, we did not identify determinants of HPV infection. We hypothesize that the high prevalence of HPV 18 in cervical cancer in Indonesia is caused by the high prevalence of HPV 18 in the Indonesian population.","de Boer MA, Vet JN, Aziz MF, Cornain S, Purwoto G, van den Akker BE, Dijkman A, Peters AA, Fleuren GJ",Int J Gynecol Cancer,2006 Sep-Oct,Cancer AND Indonesia
32616679,Overview of Helicobacter pylori Infection in Indonesia: What Distinguishes It from Countries with High Gastric Cancer Incidence?,"Helicobacter pylori infects more than half the human population. However, the prevalence in Indonesia is low, as is the prevalence of gastric cancer. Hence, it could be instructive to compare these prevalence rates and their determining factors with those of countries that have high gastric cancer incidence. Ethnicity and genetic characteristics of H. pylori are important determinants of the H. pylori infection rate in Indonesia. The infection rate is higher in Bataknese, Papuans and Buginese than in Javanese, the predominant ethnic group. Ethnicity is also an important determinant of the genetic characteristics of H. pylori. Analysis of CagA in the EPIYA segment showed that the predominant genotypes in Papuans, Bataknese and Buginese are ABB-, ABDand ABC-type CagA, respectively. Meanwhile, in the countries with high gastric cancer incidence, almost all strains had East Asian type CagA. An antibiotic susceptibility evaluation showed that the standard triple therapy can still be used with caution in several cities. There is a very high rate of resistance to second-line regimens such as levofloxacin and metronidazole. Recent studies have shown that furazolidone, rifabutin and sitafloxacin are potential alternative treatments for antibiotic-resistant H. pylori infection in Indonesia. Rather than focusing on early detection and eradication as in countries with high gastric cancer prevalence, countries with low gastric cancer prevalence should focus on screening the several groups that have a high risk of gastric cancer.","Miftahussurur M, Waskito LA, Fauzia KA, Mahmudah I, Doohan D, Adnyana IK, Khomsan A, Ratnasari N, Rezkitha YAA",Gut Liver,2021 Sep 15,Cancer AND Indonesia
30269369,Survival analysis and development of a prognostic nomogram for bone-metastatic prostate cancer patients: A single-center experience in Indonesia.,"OBJECTIVES: To analyze predictive clinical factors of survival in bone-metastatic prostate cancer, and to develop a prognostic nomogram for patients with this condition. METHODS: The present study included 392 patients with bone-metastatic prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy. Pretreatment parameters were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model to identify the predictors of overall survival. Covariates - which showed statistical significance on multivariate analysis - were used to develop a nomogram. A linear predictor model was utilized to develop the nomogram. RESULTS: The median overall survival was 40.3 months (95% confidence interval 32.2-48.5). Univariate analysis showed that clinical T stage, Gleason score, initial prostate-specific antigen value and the number of metastatic lesions were independent prognostic factors for overall survival. These predictors remained significant as independent prognostic factors for overall survival after analysis using the multivariate Cox regression model. The nomogram constructed from those prognostic factors showed good discrimination for predicting the 5-year overall survival, with an area under the curve of 0.69. Acceptable agreement of the observed and predicted probabilities was observed in the calibration plot. CONCLUSIONS: The present prognostic nomogram might be a useful tool for predicting overall survival in pretreatment bone-metastatic prostate cancer, specifically among Indonesian patients. Further studies are required to provide external validation to support the utilization of this nomogram.","Afriansyah A, Hamid ARA, Mochtar CA, Umbas R",Int J Urol,2019 Jan,Cancer AND Indonesia

METHODS: Urine samples were collected from each PCa and BPH patient. miRNA-21 relative expression against the reference gene was analyzed and compared between the two. miRNA expression was then analyzed using the comparative quantification method to find the fold change. miR-21 validity in identifying PCa patients was performed by quantifying the sensitivity and specificity using samples in this study. RESULT: The results of this study indicated that miRNA-21 relative expression against miRNA-16 in PCa and BPH showed 12.95 differences in fold change. Moreover, using prostate biopsy as the gold standard to differentiate PCa and BPH, miRNA-21 Cq expression has 100% sensitivity and 75% specificity in differentiating the two. CONCLUSION: miRNA-21 relative expression can be used to discriminate PCa from BPH by using a urine sample. Furthermore, the expression of miR-21 has higher sensitivity than PSA; therefore, miR-21 has a high potential to be analyzed and developed further for clinical diagnosis of prostate cancer.","Gunawan RR, Astuti I, Danarto HR",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2023 Mar 1,Cancer AND Indonesia

37043710,Cancer Survivors' Experiences With and Preferences for Medical Information Disclosure and Advance Care Planning: An Online Survey Among Indonesian Cancer Support Groups.,"PURPOSE: To understand the experiences and preferences of Indonesian cancer survivors regarding medical information disclosure and advance care planning. METHODS: On the basis of systematic reviews of the scientific literature, qualitative studies, and expert-panel input, we developed an online survey that was distributed to nine cancer survivor support groups in Indonesia. RESULTS: A total of 1,030 valid responses were received. Most participants were younger than 60 years (92%), female (91%), married (78%), Muslim (75%), diagnosed with breast cancer (68%), highly educated (64%), and more than one year beyond diagnosis of their cancer. If diagnosed with a life-limiting illness, participants wished to be informed about their diagnosis (74%), disease severity (61%), estimated curability (81%), expected disease trajectory (66%), and estimated life expectancy (37%). Between 46%-69% of the participants wished to discuss four topics of advance care planning (end-of-life treatments, resuscitation, health care proxies, and what matters at the end of life); 21%-42% had done so. Of those who wished to discuss these topics, 36%-79% preferred to do so with their family members. The most important reasons for not being willing to engage in advance care planning were the desire to surrender to God's will and to focus on here and now. CONCLUSION: In a group of cancer survivors, most of them were highly educated, young, female, and diagnosed with breast cancer. Their preferences for medical information and advance care planning varied, with the majority wishing for information and involvement in advance care planning. Culturally sensitive advance care planning involves health care professionals eliciting individuals' preferences for medical information disclosure and discussing different topics in advance care planning conversations.","Martina D, Angka RN, Putranto R, Shatri H, Sudoyo AW, van der Heide A, van der Rijt CCD, Rietjens JAC",JCO Glob Oncol,2023 Apr,Cancer AND Indonesia
36085000,[Sexual and social adjustments of indonesian male partners of gynecological cancer survivor].,"OBJECTIVE: This study explores the sexual and social adjustments of the partners of gynecological cancer survivors in Indonesia. METHOD: Phenomenological research interviewed seven male participants whose spouses sought gynecological cancer treatment at the Army Hospital in Jakarta from July to August 2020. The collected data were transcribed and thematically analyzed. RESULTS: The male partners described their loss of sexual desire and intimacy. They indicated a constructed sexual and social adjustments, including having sexual distractions, alternative sexual activities, and performing extended roles in the family after their partner's diagnosis and treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These research findings suggest that oncology and family nursing interventions should mitigate the gynecological cancer survivors and partners' sexual and social distress to enhance the couple's relationship and well-being after a gynecological cancer diagnosis.","Rosdiana M, Afiyanti Y",Enferm Clin (Engl Ed),2022 Sep-Oct,Cancer AND Indonesia
37769530,Unveiling bone metastasis: Exploring histological subtypes of breast cancer in Indonesia's tertiary referral hospital.,"INTRODUCTION: The histological grade of a tumor is an important prognostic indicator in both primary breast cancer and metastatic. We aimed to show the distribution of bone metastasis locations across different histological subtypes of breast cancer and how they relate to each. METHODS: The cohort retrospective study comprised 65 patients diagnosed with bone-only metastatic breast cancer, all female. The secondary statistics for 2014 to 2022 were derived from breast cancer registration data collected to determine the relationships between patterns of bone metastases sites and histopathological grading in various histological categories. RESULTS: The average age was 44.28+/-9.80 years (25-62 years), with 38 patients (58.5%) diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) and 27 patients (41.5%) with Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC). Grade III were found in 34 patients (50.8%), Grade II in 31 patients (47.7%) and Grade I in one patient (1.5%). The most common sites of bone metastases are costae, followed by femur, vertebrae and pelvic. Vertebrae and costae metastasis are significantly correlated with histological grading and breast cancer pathology (p: 0.027 and 0.033, respectively). CONCLUSION: There is a considerable difference between vertebrae and costae metastasis in terms of histological grading and breast cancer pathology which indicates the higher grade contains a greater variety of bone metastases sites.","Siregar KB, Al Anas M",Cancer Treat Res Commun,2023,Cancer AND Indonesia
34048171,Determinants of Breast Cancer Screening Practice among Women in Indonesia: A Nationwide Study.,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer remains the leading cause of death for women globally, including in Indonesia. Breast cancer screening plays a vital role in reducing deaths caused by breast cancer. However, breast cancer screening rate is still low and studies on determinants for breast cancer screening is limited in Indonesia. This study aimed to identify the determinants of breast cancer screening among women in Indonesia. METHODS: This population-based study was conducted among 827 women who lived in either rural and urban areas, using a stratified sampling design where were based on province and locality combinations. Data were analysed using a binary logistic regression model to assess the associations between independent and dependent variables. RESULTS: As many as 827 women with an average age of 29.91 (+/- 11.14) years old participated in this study. The overall breast cancer screening among women was 18.74%. Knowledge of breast cancer risk factors, signs, and symptoms (adj.OR = 1.75, 95%CI: 1.20 - 2.56), age of 35 to 39 years old (adj.OR. = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.02 - 2.26), and household income of >/=6,000,000 IDR (>/=457 USD) (adj.OR. = 5.19, 95%CI: 1.43-18.84) were associated with breast cancer screening attendance. In contrast, Christian women had a significantly lower breast cancer screening rate that women from other religions (adj. OR. = 0.45, 95%CI: 0.24 - 0.85). CONCLUSION: The overall breast cancer screening attendance was poor among Indonesian women population. Age, household income, religion, and knowledge of breast cancer risk factors were identified as the determinant factors for breast cancer screening.","Solikhah S, Lianawati L, Matahari R, Rejeki DSS",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2021 May 1,Cancer AND Indonesia
37597401,The effectiveness of play therapy in children with leukemia: A systematic review.,"PROBLEM: Leukemia is the most common form of childhood cancer worldwide. Children living with leukemia experience various problems because of the disease's progression, harmful effects of treatment, and prolonged hospitalization process. To increase their well-being and alleviate their problems, these children require ongoing support. One solution that both parents and professionals can use is play therapy. This systematic review aimed to identify the type and effectiveness of play therapy in children living with leukemia. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We searched PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and ProQuest databases. Additionally, we performed manual searches on Google Scholar, Google Web, and grey literature. Inclusion criteria comprised: 1) Studies that implemented play therapy on leukemia children, 2) Full-text articles available in English or Indonesian languages from January 2000 to December 2021 and updated until July 2023, and 3) Intervention studies employing quasi-experimental or randomized controlled trial (RCT) designs. SAMPLE: From 1099 articles, 16 studies were selected. Several forms of play therapy were found, including pretend, music, art, and sand play therapy. RESULTS: Of the sixteen studies in this systematic review, fifteen demonstrated beneficial effects on psychological issues, particularly anxiety, despair, stress, and physical problems (fatigue and pain). CONCLUSION: Play therapy effectively alleviates some physical and psychosocial problems in children living with leukemia. IMPLICATION: Nurses can utilize play therapy as an intervention for children living with leukemia. Additionally, comparative research is recommended with a similar research strategy concerning studies with the same design.

27510358,Delays in diagnosis and treatment of childhood cancer in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Emphasizing timely diagnosis and treatment of cancer are important themes in pediatric cancer management, as delays adversely impact survival. This study explores various delay types among children with cancer and determines factors that influence delays. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at an Indonesian academic hospital. Parents of newly diagnosed patients were interviewed between October 2013 and September 2014 using semistructured questionnaires. Patient, physician, diagnosis, treatment, healthcare system (HCS), and total delay were analyzed. RESULTS: Parents of 145 children (response rate 89%) with cancer were interviewed. Median total delay was 70 days (range 5-4,055). Patient delay (median 5 days, range 0-189) was significantly shorter than HCS delay (median 49 days, range 4-4,025, P < 0.001). Diagnosis delay (median 58 days, range 3-4,015) was significantly longer than treatment delay (median 3 days, range 1-89, P < 0.001). Older age at diagnosis significantly lengthened patient delay (P = 0.044). Using alternative treatment was associated with significantly longer patient and total delay (P = 0.025, 0.024, respectively). Cancer type significantly influenced physician, diagnosis, treatment, HCS, and total delay (P = 0.001, P = 0.004, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively). Neurological tumors had the longest delays, whereas hematological tumors had the shortest. Sex, parents' education or income level, disease stage at diagnosis, health insurance status, distance from hospital, and first attended health-facility type did not significantly impact the length of any delay type. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare providers need training to improve recognition of cancer symptoms and speed up subsequent diagnostic processes. Using alternative treatment increased patient and total delays. Community campaigns to encourage families to seek conventional cancer treatments are recommended.","Handayani K, Sitaresmi MN, Supriyadi E, Widjajanto PH, Susilawati D, Njuguna F, van de Ven PM, Kaspers GJ, Mostert S",Pediatr Blood Cancer,2016 Dec,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
32105305,Global Retinoblastoma Presentation and Analysis by National Income Level.,"IMPORTANCE: Early diagnosis of retinoblastoma, the most common intraocular cancer, can save both a child's life and vision. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that many children across the world are diagnosed late. To our knowledge, the clinical presentation of retinoblastoma has never been assessed on a global scale. OBJECTIVES: To report the retinoblastoma stage at diagnosis in patients across the world during a single year, to investigate associations between clinical variables and national income level, and to investigate risk factors for advanced disease at diagnosis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 278 retinoblastoma treatment centers were recruited from June 2017 through December 2018 to participate in a cross-sectional analysis of treatment-naive patients with retinoblastoma who were diagnosed in 2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Age at presentation, proportion of familial history of retinoblastoma, and tumor stage and metastasis. RESULTS: The cohort included 4351 new patients from 153 countries; the median age at diagnosis was 30.5 (interquartile range, 18.3-45.9) months, and 1976 patients (45.4%) were female. Most patients (n = 3685 [84.7%]) were from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Globally, the most common indication for referral was leukocoria (n = 2638 [62.8%]), followed by strabismus (n = 429 [10.2%]) and proptosis (n = 309 [7.4%]). Patients from high-income countries (HICs) were diagnosed at a median age of 14.1 months, with 656 of 666 (98.5%) patients having intraocular retinoblastoma and 2 (0.3%) having metastasis. Patients from low-income countries were diagnosed at a median age of 30.5 months, with 256 of 521 (49.1%) having extraocular retinoblastoma and 94 of 498 (18.9%) having metastasis. Lower national income level was associated with older presentation age, higher proportion of locally advanced disease and distant metastasis, and smaller proportion of familial history of retinoblastoma. Advanced disease at diagnosis was more common in LMICs even after adjusting for age (odds ratio for low-income countries vs upper-middle-income countries and HICs, 17.92 [95% CI, 12.94-24.80], and for lower-middle-income countries vs upper-middle-income countries and HICs, 5.74 [95% CI, 4.30-7.68]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study is estimated to have included more than half of all new retinoblastoma cases worldwide in 2017. Children from LMICs, where the main global retinoblastoma burden lies, presented at an older age with more advanced disease and demonstrated a smaller proportion of familial history of retinoblastoma, likely because many do not reach a childbearing age. Given that retinoblastoma is curable, these data are concerning and mandate intervention at national and international levels. Further studies are needed to investigate factors, other than age at presentation, that may be associated with advanced disease in LMICs.","Fabian ID, Abdallah E, Abdullahi SU, Abdulqader RA, Adamou

34114307,Impact of universal health coverage on childhood cancer outcomes in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Starting from 2014, the Indonesian government has implemented Universal Health Coverage (UHC) with the aim to make healthcare services accessible and affordable to all Indonesian citizens. A major reason for childhood cancer treatment failure in low- and middle-income countries, particularly among families with low socioeconomic status (SES), is abandonment of expensive cancer treatment. Our study compared childhood cancer treatment outcomes of the overall, low, and high SES population before and after introduction of UHC at a large Indonesian academic hospital. METHODS: Medical records of 1040 patients diagnosed with childhood cancer before (2011-2013, n = 506) and after (2014-2016, n = 534) introduction of UHC were abstracted retrospectively. Data on treatment outcome, SES, and health-insurance status at diagnosis were obtained. FINDINGS: After introduction of UHC, the number of insured patients increased from 38% to 82% (P < 0.001). Among low SES population, insurance coverage increased from 40% to 85% (P < 0.001), and among high SES population from 33% to 77% (P < 0.001). In the overall population, treatment abandonment decreased from 36% to 22% (P < 0.001). Event-free survival estimates at four years after diagnosis of overall population improved from 16% to 22% (P < 0.001). Hazard ratio for treatment failure was 1.26 (CI: 1.07-1.48, P = 0.006) for uninsured versus insured patients. In the low SES population, treatment abandonment decreased from 36% to 19% (P < 0.001). Event-free survival estimates at four years after diagnosis of low SES population improved from 14% to 22% (P < 0.001). INTERPRETATION: Introduction of UHC in Indonesia contributed significantly to better treatment outcome and event-free survival of children with cancer from low SES families.","Indraswari BW, Kelling E, Vassileva SM, Sitaresmi MN, Danardono D, Mulatsih S, Supriyadi E, Widjajanto PH, Sutaryo S, Kaspers GL, Mostert S",Pediatr Blood Cancer,2021 Sep,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
27300676,Paediatric cancer stage in population-based cancer registries: the Toronto consensus principles and guidelines.,"Population-based cancer registries generate estimates of incidence and survival that are essential for cancer surveillance, research, and control strategies. Although data on cancer stage allow meaningful assessments of changes in cancer incidence and outcomes, stage is not recorded by most population-based cancer registries. The main method of staging adult cancers is the TNM classification. The criteria for staging paediatric cancers, however, vary by diagnosis, have evolved over time, and sometimes vary by cooperative trial group. Consistency in the collection of staging data has therefore been challenging for population-based cancer registries. We assembled key experts and stakeholders (oncologists, cancer registrars, epidemiologists) and used a modified Delphi approach to establish principles for paediatric cancer stage collection. In this Review, we make recommendations on which staging systems should be adopted by population-based cancer registries for the major childhood cancers, including adaptations for low-income countries. Wide adoption of these guidelines in registries will ease international comparative incidence and outcome studies.","Gupta S, Aitken JF, Bartels U, Brierley J, Dolendo M, Friedrich P, Fuentes-Alabi S, Garrido CP, Gatta G, Gospodarowicz M, Gross T, Howard SC, Molyneux E, Moreno F, Pole JD, Pritchard-Jones K, Ramirez O, Ries LAG, Rodriguez-Galindo C, Shin HY, Steliarova-Foucher E, Sung L, Supriyadi E, Swaminathan R, Torode J, Vora T, Kutluk T, Frazier AL",Lancet Oncol,2016 Apr,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
35043272,Anti-Mullerian hormone and puberty development in girls and adolescents who underwent cancer treatment.,"BACKGROUND: High survival rates of children diagnosed with cancer have led to a growing population of women with premature ovarian failure (POF) due to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The POF process occurs due to the disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary and gonadal axis followed by the delay of puberty development. Evaluation of reproductive function in children with cancer is essential to determine the fertility preservation plan. This study aimed to describe reproductive functions in children and adolescents with cancer who received chemotherapy based on Tanner stage evaluation, menstrual cycle, and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) examination using electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay kit. RESULTS: Twenty-three girls aged 12-18 years old and had menarche who underwent cancer therapy in January-August 2019 in Dr. Sardjito General Hospital were included in the study. Among them, 61% had low AMH levels and were defined as diminished ovarian reserve (DOR). Two subjects with DOR experienced delayed puberty. Regular menstrual cycle was reported in 65.2% of subjects and irregular menstrual cycle in 34.8%, while 21.7% with irregular menstrual cycle encountered secondary amenorrhea. CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy exposure affected DOR occurrence in 60.9% of patients with childhood and adolescence cancer. Moreover, it also altered menstrual regularity in 34.8% and delayed puberty development in 8.7% subjects.","Ayuandari S, Dewanto A, Oktasari R, Rahmawati NR, Alma NA, Hamurajib KC, Mulatsih S",Arch Gynecol Obstet,2022 Jun,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
30051647,Health-care providers' perspectives on traditional and complementary alternative medicine of childhood cancer in Kenya.,"PURPOSE: Traditional and complementary alternative medicine (TCAM) use is rising globally. In many African countries, TCAM has been a way of life as the first and last resort remedy for many ailments, including cancer. Health-care providers (HCP) should address this need properly. This study explores HCP perspectives on TCAM in Kenya. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used questionnaires. HCP involved in the care of children with cancer at a Kenyan academic hospital were interviewed. RESULTS: In total, 155 HCP (response rate 79%) participated. Only 18% of HCP were positive about TCAM use. However, most HCP (85%) use TCAM themselves. More doctors (90%) than other HCP (56%) think that chemotherapy can cure cancer (P < 0.001).Thirty-three percent of HCP believe a combination of TCAM and chemotherapy is the best way to cure cancer, while 56% think that usefulness of TCAM is underestimated in conventional medicine. Self-prayer is regarded as most effective (58%) and safe (76%). Most harmful is witchcraft (80%). Most HCP (71%) think their knowledge about safety and efficacy of TCAM is inadequate. HCP think that their cancer patients use TCAM (97%) and that it is important that parents inform them about this (97%). However, only 5% of HCP always openly discuss TCAM with parents. CONCLUSIONS: HCP need to improve their knowledge of TCAM and facilitate open communication about TCAM with families so parents feel safe to discuss their interest in it.","Olbara G, Parigger J, Njuguna F, Skiles J, Sitaresmi MN, Gordijn S, van de Ven P, Kaspers G, Mostert S",Pediatr Blood Cancer,2018 Dec,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
32888473,Development of paediatric non-stage prognosticator guidelines for population-based cancer registries and updates to the 2014 Toronto Paediatric Cancer Stage Guidelines.,"Population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) generate measures of cancer incidence and survival that are essential for cancer surveillance, research, and cancer control strategies. In 2014, the Toronto Paediatric Cancer Stage Guidelines were developed to standardise how PBCRs collect data on the stage at diagnosis for childhood cancer cases. These guidelines have been implemented in multiple jurisdictions worldwide to facilitate international comparative studies of incidence and outcome. Robust stratification by risk also requires data on key non-stage prognosticators (NSPs). Key experts and stakeholders used a modified Delphi approach to establish principles guiding paediatric cancer NSP data collection. With the use of these principles, recommendations were made on which NSPs should be collected for the major malignancies in children. The 2014 Toronto Stage Guidelines were also reviewed and updated where necessary. Wide adoption of the resultant Paediatric NSP Guidelines and updated Toronto Stage Guidelines will enhance the harmonisation and use of childhood cancer data provided by PBCRs.","Gupta S, Aitken J, Bartels U, Bhakta N, Bucurenci M, Brierley JD, De Camargo B, Chokunonga E, Clymer J, Coza D, Fraser C, Fuentes-Alabi S, Gatta G, Gross T, Jakab Z, Kohler B, Kutluk T, Moreno F, Nakata K, Nur S, Parkin DM, Penberthy L, Pole J, Poynter JN, Pritchard-Jones K, Ramirez O, Renner L, Steliarova-Foucher E, Sullivan M, Swaminathan R, Van Eycken L, Vora T, Frazier AL",Lancet Oncol,2020 Sep,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
23464480,Socio-economic status plays important roles in childhood cancer treatment outcome in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: The influence of parental socio-economic status on childhood cancer treatment outcome in low-income countries has not been sufficiently investigated. Our study examined this influence and explored parental experiences during cancer treatment of their children in an Indonesian academic hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical charts of 145 children diagnosed with cancer between 1999 and 2009 were reviewed retrospectively. From October 2011 until January 2012, 40 caretakers were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires. RESULTS: Of all patients, 48% abandoned treatment, 34% experienced death, 9% had progressive/ relapsed disease, and 9% overall event-free survival. Prosperous patients had better treatment outcome than poor patients (P<0.0001). Odds-ratio for treatment abandonment was 3.3 (95%CI: 1.4-8.1, p=0.006) for poor versus prosperous patients. Parents often believed that their child's health was beyond doctor control and determined by luck, fate or God (55%). Causes of cancer were thought to be destiny (35%) or God's punishment (23%). Alternative treatment could (18%) or might (50%) cure cancer. Most parents (95%) would like more information about cancer and treatment. More contact with doctors was desired (98%). Income decreased during treatment (55%). Parents lost employment (48% fathers, 10% mothers), most of whom stated this loss was caused by their child's cancer (84% fathers, 100% mothers). Loss of income led to financial difficulties (63%) and debts (55%). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment abandonment was most important reason for treatment failure. Treatment outcome was determined by parental socio-economic status. Childhood cancer survival could improve if financial constraints and provision of information and guidance are better addressed.","Mostert S, Gunawan S, Wolters E, van de Ven P, Sitaresmi M, Dongen Jv, Veerman A, Mantik M, Kaspers G",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2012,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
35748941,Cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in childhood cancer: comparison between two countries.,"BACKGROUND: Various definitions used to describe cisplatin nephrotoxicity potentially lead to differences in determination of risk factors. This study evaluated incidence of kidney injury according to commonly used and alternative definitions in two cohorts of children who received cisplatin. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included children from Vancouver, Canada (one center), and Mexico City, Mexico (two centers), treated with cisplatin for a variety of solid tumors. Serum creatinine-based definitions (KDIGO and Pediatric RIFLE (pRIFLE)), electrolyte abnormalities consisted of hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia (based on NCI-CTCAE v5), and an alternative definition (Alt-AKI) were used to describe nephrotoxicity. Incidence with different definitions, definitional overlap, and inter-definition reliability was analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 173 children (100 from Vancouver, 73 from Mexico) were included. In the combined cohort, Alt-AKI criteria detected more patients with cisplatin nephrotoxicity compared to pRIFLE and KDIGO criteria (82.7 vs. 63.6 vs. 44.5%, respectively). Nephrotoxicity and all electrolyte abnormalities were significantly more common in Vancouver cohort than in Mexico City cohort except when using KDIGO definition. The most common electrolyte abnormalities were hypomagnesemia (88.9%, Vancouver) and hypophosphatemia (24.2%, Mexico City). The KDIGO definition provided highest overlap of cases in Vancouver (100%), Mexico (98.6%), and the combined cohort (99.4%). Moderate overall agreement was found among Alt-AKI, KDIGO, and pRIFLE definitions (kappa = 0.18, 95% CI 0.1-0.27) in which KDIGO and pRIFLE showed moderate agreement (kappa = 0.48, 95% CI 0.36-0.60). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to pRIFLE and KDIGO criteria, Alt-AKI criteria detected more patients with cisplatin nephrotoxicity. pRIFLE is more sensitive to detect not only actual kidney injury but also patients at risk of cisplatin nephrotoxicity, while KDIGO seems more useful to detect clinically significant kidney injury.

37275364,"Epidemiologic, clinical, and serum markers may improve discrimination between bacterial and viral etiologies of childhood pneumonia.","BACKGROUND: Discrimination of bacterial and viral etiologies of childhood community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is often challenging. Unnecessary antibiotic administration exposes patients to undue risks and may engender antimicrobial resistance. This study aimed to develop a prediction model using epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data to differentiate between bacterial and viral CAP. METHODS: Data from 155 children with confirmed bacterial or mixed bacterial and viral infection (N = 124) and viral infection (N = 31) were derived from a comprehensive assessment of causative pathogens [Partnerships for Enhanced Engagement in Research-Pneumonia in Pediatrics (PEER-PePPeS)] conducted in Indonesia. Epidemiologic, clinical and biomarker profiles (hematology and inflammatory markers) were compared between groups. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for varying biomarker levels was used to characterize performance and determine cut-off values for discrimination of bacterial and mixed CAP versus viral CAP. Diagnostic predictors of bacterial and mixed CAP were assessed by multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Diarrhea was more frequently reported in bacterial and mixed CAP, while viral infections more frequently occurred during Indonesia's rainy season. White blood cell counts (WBC), absolute neutrophil counts (ANC), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin (PCT) were significantly higher in bacterial and mixed cases. After adjusting for covariates, the following were the most important predictors of bacterial or mixed CAP: rainy season (aOR 0.26; 95% CI 0.08-0.90; p = 0.033), CRP >/=5.70 mg/L (aOR 4.71; 95% CI 1.18-18.74; p = 0.028), and presence of fever (aOR 5.26; 95% CI 1.07-25.91; p = 0.041). The model assessed had a low R-squared (Nagelkerke R(2) = 0.490) but good calibration (p = 0.610 for Hosmer Lemeshow test). The combination of CRP and fever had moderate predictive value with sensitivity and specificity of 62.28 and 65.52%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Combining clinical and laboratory profiles is potentially valuable for discriminating bacterial and mixed from viral pediatric CAP and may guide antibiotic use. Further studies with a larger sample size should be performed to validate this model.","Farida H, Triasih R, Lokida D, Mardian Y, Salim G, Wulan WN, Butar-Butar DP, Sari RA, Budiman A, Hayuningsih C, Anam MS, Dipayana S, Mujahidah M, Setyati A, Aman AT, Naysilla AM, Lukman N, Diana A, Karyana M, Kline A, Neal A, Lane HC, Kosasih H, Lau CY",Front Med (Lausanne),2023,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia

23703746,"Health-care providers' perspectives on childhood cancer treatment in Manado, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: Childhood cancer survival in low-income countries is low. OBJECTIVE: Our study investigated health-care providers' perspectives on childhood cancer treatment in Indonesia. Their health beliefs and attitudes toward parental financial difficulties, protocol adherence, parental education, and communication were explored. METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire was filled in by 222 health-care providers (156 doctors, 51 nurses, 6 social workers, 9 administrators) RESULTS: Health of children with cancer is beyond doctor's control and determined by luck, fate or God according to 35% of health-care providers, 30% were uncertain about this statement, and 35% disagreed. Combination of chemotherapy and alternative treatment is best to achieve cure according to 15% of health-care providers, 50% were uncertain, and 35% disagreed. Prosperous parents adhere better with treatment (67%). Doctors adhere better with cancer treatment for prosperous patients (55%). When dealing with poor families, less elaborate explanation is given (62%), more difficult vocabulary is used (49%), and less cooperation is offered (46%). Reasons for non-adherence with treatment protocol were as follows: financial difficulties parents (82%), side-effects (77%), lack of motivation parents (75%), and inadequate drugs supply at pharmacy (70%). Information about cancer and treatment makes parents more afraid or depressed about future, and parents prefer not to know according to 27% of health-care providers, 20% were uncertain, and 53% disagreed. Communication with parents is hindered by differences in status and social hierarchical structures (83%). CONCLUSIONS: Health-care providers' beliefs about childhood cancer treatment are characterized by much uncertainty and contradiction. This likely affects adherence of health-care providers, parents, and childhood cancer treatment outcome.","Mostert S, Gunawan S, van Dongen JA, van de Ven PM, Sitaresmi MN, Wolters EE, Veerman AJ, Mantik M, Kaspers GJ",Psychooncology,2013 Nov,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
35856702,"Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: Four years evaluation of protocols 2013 and 2016 in a single center in Indonesia, a lower-middle-income country.","BACKGROUND: The prognosis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Indonesia, a lower-middle-income country (LMIC), is lower than in high income countries (HICs). The Indonesian ALL2013 protocol resulted in too many toxic deaths (21%) and abandonments (11%). Therefore, we drafted an adapted protocol, ALL2016. Main changes: no anthracyclines in standard risk (SR), prednisone replaced dexamethasone at induction in high risk (HR), and anthracyclines and cyclophosphamide were rescheduled in HR. PROCEDURE: Patients (aged: 1-18 years) were stratified into SR and HR. HR was defined as age over 10 years, leucocyte count over 50 x 10(9) /L, central nervous system (CNS) involvement, mediastinal mass, T-cell phenotype, testicular involvement, or poor prednisone response. RESULTS: ALL2013 included 174 patients (106 SR and 68 HR) and ALL2016 188 (91 SR and 97 HR). Although the number of HR patients was significantly higher in ALL2016 (51.6% vs. 39.1%; p = .017), the outcome of ALL2016 improved over ALL2013 (4-year-probable overall survival (pOS) 60.1% vs. 50.0%; p = .042 and 4-year-probable event-free survival (pEFS) 49.5% vs. 36.8%; p = .018). ALL2016 showed a nonsignificant advantage for SR patients (4-year-pEFS 56.0% vs. 47.2%; p = .220 and 4-year-pOS 70.3% vs. 61.3%; p = .166), but less toxic deaths (7% vs. 20%; p = .011). In HR group, the outcomes were significantly better in ALL2016 (4-year-pEFS 43.3% vs. 20.6%; p = .004; 4-year-pOS 50.5% vs. 32.4%; p = .014) especially due to less relapses (31% vs. 62%; p = .001). Isolated CNS relapses went down from 18 to 8% in HR (p = .010) and 11 to 5% in SR (p = .474). Both SR and HR showed lower numbers of abandonment in ALL2016 (6% vs. 14%; p = .039).

This was a cross-sectional studies during early pandemic and analyze factors in parents whose children had treatment for malignancy contribute to their children's abandonment treatment rate through guided interview using questionnaire. The characteristic related significantly with treatment abandonment is maternal education. It is found that patients whose mother had education less than secondary school was 1.315 (CI 1.013-1.707) having risk experience abandonment treatment. Parental perception related to impact of COVID-19 was significantly related to treatment abandonment rate with RR 0.202 (CI 0.86-0.471). Patients whose parents have positive perception how abandonment treatment affect their child outcome, believe that doctor has taken step to prevent COVID-19 transmission during treatment, and receive information about COVID-19, having less risk being abandonment treatment.","Susanah S, Modjaningrat IF, Sari NM, Suryawan N",Glob Pediatr Health,2022,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
27221843,Parental Experiences with Chemotherapy-Induced Alopecia among Childhood Cancer Patients in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: This study assessed parental experiences with chemotherapy-induced alopecia among children with cancer treated at an Indonesian academic hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty parents of childhood cancer patients were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires. RESULTS: The moment that hair fell out was the moment that parents (84%) had to admit their child had cancer. Alopecia was a traumatizing painful experience (46%). Active strategies to hide alopecia, mainly hats, were used by 66% of children, while 34% never covered their bald head. If money had not been an issue, 40% would use another strategy. Alopecia made children limit outdoor daily activities (78%) and engagement with others (60%). Significantly more children from high-educated (95%) than low-educated (60%) parents received sympathy from other people (P=0.012). Significantly more Christian (29%) than Muslim (0%) families confirmed that alopecia lowered the quality of life (P=0.046). Most parents (82%) had no prior plans about alopecia management, yet for significantly more girls (26%) than boys (0%) such plans existed (P=0.044). Parents received most information about alopecia from other parents (66%). Parents (92%) needed more alopecia education from doctors. Of all school-attending children, 53% were bullied and 47% did not want to attend school due to alopecia. Significantly more high-educated than low-educated families received pity from teachers and pupils (94% vs. 0%, P=0.004), and acceptance by pupils (81% vs. 0%, P=0.021). CONCLUSIONS: Alopecia is a severe, far-stretching side-effect of chemotherapy with physical, psychological and social consequences for children and parents. Parents should be better informed about occurrence and impact of alopecia. Extra attention is required to facilitate children's return to school. Health- care providers should facilitate optimal supportive care through open dialogue and provision of educational materials for parents, children and their community.","Gunawan S, Broeke CT, Ven Pv, Arnoldussen M, Kaspers G, Mostert S",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2016,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
38405084,"Survival and Treatment Outcomes of Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in a Low-Middle Income Country: A Single-Center Experience in West Java, Indonesia.","PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the survival rates and treatment outcomes of patients with childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in a single-center study at Indonesia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Factors contributing to the relapse and survival of ALL in Bandung, Indonesia, were evaluated. Data were collected from the medical record and the Indonesian Pediatric Cancer Registry (IPCAR). Subsequently, univariate and multivariate analyses were evaluated using Cox proportional hazard regression and Kaplan Meier was used for survival analysis. An analytic observational study was conducted on newly diagnosed children aged 1-18 with ALL from January 2019 to December 2022. RESULTS: A total of 137 children were included in the analysis, 30 (21,9%) were dropped out during treatment and 60.5% died during the study period. Most of the deaths occurred after relapse in 32 (38.5%) with a high early relapse (70.5%), occurring mainly during the maintenance phase (42.4%). At the one-year mark, the observed overall survival (OS) rate was at 36%, while event-free survival (EFS) was lower, at 19%. Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that the leucocyte counts at diagnosis (p=0.005) and response to induction phase (p < 0.008) was associated with the death of ALL. Furthermore, a response to induction phase was significant [hazard ratio 4.67 (CI 95%: 1.64-13.29); p = 0.004] in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study underscored the persistent challenges of high treatment discontinuation rates and the occurrence of very early relapses in low- to middle-income countries (LMICs), which significantly impacted the OS of children diagnosed with ALL.","Ramadhan MH, Sari NM, Peryoga SU, Susanah S",J Blood Med,2024,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
20824655,Xenobiotic and folate pathway gene polymorphisms and risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in Javanese children.,"Xenobiotic and folate metabolic pathways are important for the maintenance of genetic stability and may influence susceptibility to the development of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). In this study, we investigated 10 polymorphisms in 6 genes (GSTM1-present/null, GSTT1-present/null, GSTP1 1578A > G, NQO1 609C > T, MTHFR 677C > T, MTHFR 1298A > C, MTHFD1 1958G > A, 3'-TYMS 1494 6bp-deletion/insertion, 5'-TYMS 28bp-tandem repeats, and SLC19A1 80G > A) in a cohort of 185 Javanese children with ALL and 177 healthy controls. In ALL patients, none of the polymorphisms demonstrated a statistically significant association with ALL after correcting for multiple comparisons. Gender-stratified analysis showed that in girls, GSTT1-null genotype was associated with increased ALL risk (OR = 2.20; p = 0.027), while GSTP1 1578AG genotype was associated with reduced risk (OR = 0.43; p = 0.031). Strong linkage disequilibrium between the MTHFR 677C > T and 1298A > C polymorphisms was observed (D' = 1.0; r(2) = 0.072). The haplotypes 677C-1298C and 677T-1298A were associated with a reduced risk of ALL (OR = 0.68 and 0.64, respectively; gender-adjusted global p = 0.028). Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was employed to identify potential high-order gene-gene interactions and cluster subjects into susceptibility groups. SLC19A1 80G > A emerged as the predominant polymorphism associated with risk of ALL. Individuals simultaneously carrying MTHFR 1298AA, 3'-TYMS 6bp deletion(s) and SLC19A1 80A-allele(s) were at higher disease risk (OR = 2.21; p < 0.001). On the contrary, simultaneous possession of MTHFR 1298CC, 3'-TYMS 6bp homozygosity and SLC19A1 80A-allele(s) conferred lower risk (OR = 0.25; p = 0.004). Carriage of NQO1 609C-allele amongst SLC19A1 80GG genotype was associated with lower risk (OR = 0.47; p = 0.003). In conclusion, our study has demonstrated the importance of gender and gene-gene interaction within the xenobiotic and folate pathways in modulating childhood ALL susceptibility.","Chan JY, Ugrasena DG, Lum DW, Lu Y, Yeoh AE",Hematol Oncol,2011 Sep,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
19679573,Comparing childhood leukaemia treatment before and after the introduction of a parental education programme in Indonesia.,"SETTING: Previously, treatment and the results of treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in Indonesia differed significantly between poor and prosperous patients. Poor patients received less individual attention from oncologists and access to parental education and donated chemotherapy was lacking. INTERVENTION: A structured parental education programme for both poor and prosperous parents was introduced in January 2004 to improve access to parental education and donated chemotherapy. The programme consisted of a video presentation, an information booklet, DVD, audiocassette, a statement-of-understanding for donated chemotherapy, and a complaints procedure. Informed consent was also sought. OBJECTIVE: Our study compared childhood ALL treatment outcome before and after the introduction of the parental education programme. DESIGN: The medical records of 283 children with ALL diagnosed before (1997-2002; n = 164) and after (2004-2006; n = 119) the introduction of the education programme were reviewed. Data on treatment results and parental socioeconomic status were collected. RESULTS: After the introduction of the education programme, treatment refusal decreased (from 14% to 2%) and event-free survival increased (from 13% to 29%) significantly among poor patients. Treatment dropout increased (from 0% to 13%) significantly among prosperous patients. Overall, toxic death (from 23% to 36%) increased significantly, but there was no significant difference in event-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: After introduction of the programme, treatment refusal decreased and event-free survival increased significantly among poor families. However, improved knowledge, skills and communication are still required to combat the high rates of toxic death and treatment dropout. Treatment intensity should be accompanied by improved supportive care.","Mostert S, Sitaresmi MN, Gundy CM, Janes V, Sutaryo, Veerman AJ",Arch Dis Child,2010 Jan,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
37190814,Radiotherapy-associated Sensorineural Hearing Loss in Pediatric Oncology Patients.,"During the radiotherapeutic treatment of pediatric oncology patients, they would be at a latent risk of developing ionizing radiation-induced ototoxicity when the cochlea or auditory nerve is located within the radiation field. Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is an irreversible late complication of radiotherapy, and its incidence depends on various factors such as the patient's hearing sensitivity, total radiation dose to the cochlea, radiotherapy fractionation regimen, age and chemoradiation. Importantly, this complication exhibits serious challenges to adult survivors of childhood cancer, as it has been linked to impairments in academic achievement, psychosocial development, independent living skills, and employment in the survivor population. Therefore, early detection and proper management can alleviate academic, speech, language, social, and psychological morbidity arising from hearing deficits. In the present review, we have addressed issues such as underlying mechanisms of radiation-induced SNHL, audiometric findings of pediatric cancer patients treated with radiotherapy, and management and protection measures against radiation-induced ototoxicity.","Aslam MA, Ahmad H, Malik HS, Uinarni H, Karim YS, Akhmedov YM, Abdelbasset WK, Awadh SA, Abid MK, Mustafa YF, Farhood B, Sahebkar A",Curr Med Chem,2024,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
37642050,Impact of Physician Dual Practices on a Pediatric-Oncology Outreach-Program.,"OBJECTIVE: Physician dual practices (PDP) can be defined as 'doctors combining clinical work in public and private health-sector.' This study explores the impact of PDP on a long-term pediatric-oncology outreach-program between large referral hospitals in the Netherlands, Indonesia and Kenya. METHODS: This cross-sectional descriptive study used a self-administered semi-structured survey.  The most senior doctor from each partner site was interviewed in June 2022. The survey contained 70 closed-ended and 7 open-ended questions and took 30-45 minutes to complete. Closed-ended questions were evaluated on 2-5 point rating scales. Informed consent was acquired and respondents endorsed the final report. RESULTS: In the Netherlands an estimated 0-20% of senior doctors combine work in public and private-sector, while 60-80% do so in Indonesia and Kenya according to the respondents. In Indonesia and Kenya, most of doctors are involved in PDP to augment low government salaries. Impact of PDP on pediatric-oncology care is minimal in the Netherlands, but detrimental in Indonesia and Kenya: shortage of experienced doctors, limited supervision of junior staff, slow diagnostics and delays in chemotherapy administration ultimately lead to undermining of the quality of care and adverse patient outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: PDP adversely impact patient care at the Indonesian and Kenyan partner sites of a pediatric-oncology outreach-program. Strategies addressing PDP in resource-poor settings are required to improve treatment outcomes and survival of children with cancer.","Olbara G, Handayani K, Hoogland I, Widjajanto P, Njuguna FM, Sitaresmi M, Kaspers G, Mostert S",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2023 Aug 1,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia

This study assesses the impact of COVID-19 government measures on a paediatric oncology outreach-program between three large referral hospitals in Netherlands (HIC), Indonesia (LMIC) and Kenya (LMIC). COVID-19 government measures have impacted childhood cancer care at all three hospitals. However, disruptions in services are more prominent at partner sites in LMIC, increasing existing inequalities. COVID-19 government measures have adversely affected the wellbeing of children with cancer in both HIC and LMIC, and the chances of survival of children with cancer in LMIC.

39472335,Exploring treatment decision-making at diagnosis for children with advanced cancer in low- and middle-income countries.,"PURPOSE: Global childhood cancer survival outcomes correlate with regional contextual factors, yet upfront treatment decision-making for children with advanced or poor prognosis cancer in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is not well understood. This study aimed to (1) characterize the landscape of contextual factors that shape physician decision-making at diagnosis for these children in LMICs and (2) describe physician rationales for if/when to offer treatment with non-curative intent, including how they define ""poor prognosis"" during treatment decision-making. METHODS: An international panel of pediatric oncologists practicing in LMICs participated in two focus groups structured for the collaborative generation of factors influencing treatment decision-making, including consideration of non-curative treatment pathways at diagnosis. Thematic analysis of qualitative data was conducted, followed by member checking. RESULTS: Eleven pediatric oncologists participated, representing all global regions defined by the World Health Organization. Participants identified a broad range of factors influencing decision-making across multiple levels, including the individual, hospital, health system, community, and country levels. All participants agreed that treatment with non-curative intent could be offered at diagnosis in certain contexts, and diverse definitions for poor prognosis were described. CONCLUSIONS: Upfront treatment decision-making for children with advanced or poor prognosis cancer in LMICs is variable and challenging. Difficulties with decision-making in LMICs may be amplified by inconsistent definitions of poor prognosis and underrepresentation of the factors that influence treatment decision-making within existing decision-making frameworks or childhood cancer treatment guidelines. Future research should explore decision-making approaches, preferences, and challenges in depth from the perspectives of pediatric cancer patients, families, and multidisciplinary clinicians.","Salek M, Porter AS, Maradiege E, Dolendo MCJ, Figueredo D, Geriga F, Gunasekera S, Kizyma R, Nguyen HTK, Nzamu I, Raza MR, Rustamova K, Sari NM, Rodriguez-Galindo C, Graetz D, Bhakta N, Kaye EC",Support Care Cancer,2024 Oct 29,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
19434599,Treatment refusal and abandonment in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Indonesia: an analysis of causes and consequences.,"BACKGROUND: Treatment refusal and abandonment are common causes of treatment failure in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in many developing countries. In most studies reasons for abandonment were based on the opinion of health-care providers (HCP), very few studies have focused on the parental point-of-view. Aims of the study were to analyze the parents' reasons of abandonment and to ascertain the fate of children who abandoned treatment in a pediatric oncology centre in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. METHODS: We conducted home-visits to interview families of ALL patients, diagnosed between January 2004 and August 2007, who refused or abandoned treatment. RESULTS: From January 2004 to August 2007, 159 patients were diagnosed with ALL of which 40 children (25%) refused or abandoned therapy. Thirty-seven (93%) of these children were home-visited. Reasons for abandonment were complex. Most parents mentioned several reasons. Financial and transportation difficulties were not the only, or even the main reasons, for abandonment. Belief of ALL incurability, experience of severe side effects and dissatisfaction with HCP were also important considerations. Most patients (64%) abandoned treatment during the diagnostic-evaluation or remission-induction phase. Of the 37 patients who refused or abandoned treatment, 26 (70%) children died, and 11 (30%) children were still alive, 2 of them more than 2 years after abandonment. CONCLUSIONS: Reducing treatment abandonment of childhood ALL in developing countries requires not only financial and transportation support, but also parental education, counseling and psychosocial support during therapy, improvement of quality-of-care and adequate management of side effects.","Sitaresmi MN, Mostert S, Schook RM, Veerman AJ",Psychooncology,2010 Apr,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
39645377,"Burden of disease scenarios by state in the USA, 2022-50: a forecasting analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.","BACKGROUND: The capacity to anticipate future health issues is important for both policy makers and practitioners in the USA, as such insights can facilitate effective planning, investment, and implementation strategies. Forecasting trends in disease and injury burden is not only crucial for policy makers but also garners substantial interest from the general populace and leads to a better-informed public. Through the integration of new data sources, the refinement of methodologies, and the inclusion of additional causes, we have improved our previous forecasting efforts within the scope of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) to produce forecasts at the state and national levels for the USA under various possible scenarios. METHODS: We developed a comprehensive framework for forecasting life expectancy, healthy life expectancy (HALE), cause-specific mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to 359 causes of disease and injury burden from 2022 to 2050 for the USA and all 50 states and Washington, DC. Using the GBD 2021 Future Health Scenarios modelling framework, we forecasted drivers of disease, demographic drivers, risk factors, temperature and particulate matter, mortality and years of life lost (YLL), population, and non-fatal burden. In addition to a reference scenario (representing the most probable future trajectory), we explored various future scenarios and their potential impacts over the next several decades on human health. These alternative scenarios comprised four risk elimination scenarios (including safer environment, improved behavioural and metabolic risks, improved childhood nutrition and vaccination, and a combined scenario) and three USA-specific scenarios based on risk exposure or attributable burden in the best-performing US states (improved high adult BMI and high fasting plasma glucose [FPG], improved smoking, and improved drug use [encompassing opioids, cocaine, amphetamine, and others]). FINDINGS: Life expectancy in the USA is projected to increase from 78.3 years (95% uncertainty interval 78.1-78.5) in 2022 to 79.9 years (79.5-80.2) in 2035, and to 80.4 years (79.8-81.0) in 2050 for all sexes combined. This increase is forecasted to be modest compared with that in other countries around the world, resulting in the USA declining in global rank over the 2022-50 forecasted period among the 204 countries and territories in GBD, from 49th to 66th. There is projected to be a decline in female life expectancy in West Virginia between 1990 and 2050, and little change in Arkansas and Oklahoma. Additionally, after 2023, we projected almost no change in female life expectancy in many states, notably in Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah, Iowa, Maine, and Wisconsin. Female HALE is projected to decline between 1990 and 2050 in 20 states and to remain unchanged in three others. Drug use disorders and low back pain are projected to be the leading Level 3 causes of age-standardised DALYs in 2050. The age-standardised DALY rate due to drug use disorders is projected to increase considerably between 2022 and 2050 (19.5% [6.9-34.1]). Our combined risk elimination scenario shows that the USA could gain 3.8 additional years (3.6-4.0) of life expectancy and 4.1 additional years (3.9-4.3) of HALE in 2050 versus the reference scenario. Using our USA-specific scenarios, we forecasted that the USA could gain 0.4 additional years (0.3-0.6) of life expectancy and 0.6 additional years (0.5-0.8) of HALE in 2050 under the improved drug use scenario relative to the reference scenario. Life expectancy and HALE are likewise projected to be 0.4-0.5 years higher in 2050 under the improved adult BMI and FPG and improved smoking scenarios compared with the reference scenario. However, the increases in these scenarios would not substantially improve the USA's global ranking in 2050 (from 66th of 204 in life expectancy in the reference scenario to 63rd-64th in each of the three USA-specific scenarios), indicating that the USA's best-performing states are still lagging behind other countries in their rank throughout the forecasted period. Regardless, an estimated 12.4 million (11.3-13.5) deaths could be averted between 2022 and 2050 if the USA were to follow the combined scenario trajectory rather than the reference scenario. There would also be 1.4 million (0.7-2.2) fewer deaths over the 28-year forecasted period with improved adult BMI and FPG, 2.1 million (1.3-2.9) fewer deaths with improved exposure to smoking, and 1.2 million (0.9-1.5) fewer deaths with lower rates of drug use deaths. INTERPRETATION: Our findings highlight the alarming trajectory of health challenges in the USA, which, if left unaddressed, could lead to a reversal of the health progress made over the past three decades for some US states and a decline in global health standing for all states. The evidence from our alternative scenarios along with other published studies suggests that through collaborative, evidence-based strategies, there are opportunities to change the trajectory of health outcomes in the USA, such as by investing in scientific innovation, health-care access, preventive health care, risk exposure reduction, and education. Our forecasts clearly show that the time to act is now, as the future of the country's health and wellbeing-as well as its prosperity and leadership position in science and innovation-are at stake.

27184775,Factors influencing time to diagnosis and treatment among pediatric oncology patients in Kenya.,"Early diagnosis and start of treatment are fundamental goals in cancer care. This study determines the time lag and the factors that influence the time to diagnosis and start of treatment. Study participants were parents of childhood cancer patients diagnosed between August 2013 and July 2014 in a hospital in Kenya. Patient, physician, diagnosis, treatment, health care system, and total delay were explored using a questionnaire. Demographic and medical data were collected from the patients' medical records. Parents of 99 childhood cancer patients were interviewed (response rate: 80%). Median total delay was 102 (9-1021) days. Median patient delay (4 days) was significantly shorter than health care system delay (median 87 days; P < .001). Diagnosis delay (median 94 days) was significantly longer than treatment delay (median 6 days; P < .001). days. Lack of health insurance at diagnosis and use of alternative medicine before attending conventional health services were associated with a significantly longer patient delay (P = .041 and P = .017, respectively). The type of cancer had a significant effect on treatment delay (P = .020). The type of health facility attended affected only patient delay (P = .03). Gender, age at diagnosis, stage of disease, parents' education level or income, and distance from hospital did not have a significant effect on the length of any type of delay. Training on childhood cancer should be included in the curricula for medical training institutes. In-service workshops should be held for the health workers already working. Families must be obligated to get health insurance. Families should be encourage to attend conventional health facilities and informed on symptoms of cancer through mass media.","Njuguna F, Martijn H, Langat S, Musimbi J, Muliro H, Skiles J, Vik T, Sitaresmi MN, van de Ven PM, Kaspers GJ, Mostert S",Pediatr Hematol Oncol,2016 Apr,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
17074838,Influence of socioeconomic status on childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment in Indonesia.,"OBJECTIVE: A major reason for poor survival of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia in developing countries is treatment refusal or abandonment. This can be associated with parental socioeconomic status and attitudes of health care providers. Our study examined the influence of 2 socioeconomic status determinants, parental income and education, on treatment in an Indonesian academic hospital. METHODS: Medical charts of 164 patients who received a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia between 1997 and 2002 were abstracted retrospectively. Data on treatment results and parental financial and educational background were collected. Open interviews were conducted with parents and health care providers. RESULTS: Of all patients, 35% refused or abandoned treatment, 23% experienced treatment-related death, 22% had progressive or relapsed leukemia, and 20% had an overall event-free survival. Treatment results differed significantly between patients with different socioeconomic status; 47% of poor and 2% of prosperous patients refused or abandoned treatment. Although poor and prosperous patients used the same protocol, the provided treatment differed. Poor patients received less individualized attention from oncologists and less structured parental education. Strong social hierarchical structures hindered communication with doctors, resulting in a lack of parental understanding of the necessity to continue treatment. Most poor patients could not afford treatment. Access to donated chemotherapy also was inadequate. Treatment refusal or abandonment frequently resulted. There was no follow-up system to detect and contact dropouts. Health care providers were not fully aware that their own attitude and communication skills were important for ensuring compliance of patients and parents. CONCLUSIONS: Children's survival of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in developing countries could improve if problems that are associated with parental financial and educational background and medical teams' attitudes to treatment and follow-up could be addressed better.","Mostert S, Sitaresmi MN, Gundy CM, Sutaryo, Veerman AJ",Pediatrics,2006 Dec,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
22471485,Immunophenotypic patterns of childhood acute leukemias in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Immunophenotyping, as suggested by WHO, may improve diagnosis of childhood leukemia since it offers a better classification of the hematopoietic lineage of malignant cells as compared to morphology. Therefore, we aimed to determine the proportion of the immunophenotypic subtypes of acute leukemia in Indonesian children. METHODS: Samples were obtained from patients (0-14 years of age) in 4 hospitals in Indonesia. We analyzed 541 suspected leukemia samples presented over a 4-year period (March 2006 - July 2010) by flow cytometry. Immunophenotyping allowed classification into acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and ALL (B-lineage and T-lineage ALL). RESULTS: Of 541 samples, 136 were tested using a single color method and 405 with a three-color method. Concordance with morphology was very good (?=0.82) using the three-color method with a panel of 15 monoclonal antibodies (n=387). A relatively high percentage of acute leukemia was classified as AML (23%). Of the ALL samples 83% were B-lineage ALL and 17% T- lineage ALL. Nine out of 239 morphological ALL were labeled AML, and 12/79 morphological AML were in fact ALL. CONCLUSION: Immunophenotyping in a multi-center study proved feasible and appears particularly important for prognostic assessment of childhood leukemia in low income countries such as Indonesia.","Supriyadi E, Widjajanto PH, Veerman AJ, Purwanto I, Nency YM, Gunawan S, Nafianti S, Purnomosari D, Intansari US, Westra G, Cloos J",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2011,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
33250288,The Practice of Paediatric Radiation Oncology in Low- and Middle-income Countries: Outcomes of an International Atomic Energy Agency Study.,"AIMS: Childhood cancer survival is suboptimal in most low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Radiotherapy plays a significant role in the standard care of many patients. To assess the current status of paediatric radiotherapy, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) undertook a global survey and a review of practice in eight leading treatment centres in middle-income countries (MICs) under Coordinated Research Project E3.30.31; 'Paediatric radiation oncology practice in low and middle income countries: a patterns-of-care study by the International Atomic Energy Agency.' MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey of paediatric radiotherapy practices was distributed to 189 centres worldwide. Eight leading radiotherapy centres in MICs treating a significant number of children were selected and developed a database of individual patients treated in their centres comprising 46 variables related to radiotherapy technique. RESULTS: Data were received from 134 radiotherapy centres in 42 countries. The percentage of children treated with curative intent fell sequentially from high-income countries (HICs; 82%) to low-income countries (53%). Increasing deficiencies were identified in diagnostic imaging, radiation staff numbers, radiotherapy technology and supportive care. More than 92.3% of centres in HICs practice multidisciplinary tumour board decision making, whereas only 65.5% of centres in LMICs use this process. Clinical guidelines were used in most centres. Practice in the eight specialist centres in MICs approximated more closely to that in HICs, but only 52% of patients were treated according to national/international protocols whereas institution-based protocols were used in 41%. CONCLUSIONS: Quality levels in paediatric radiotherapy differ among countries but also between centres within countries. In many LMICs, resources are scarce, coordination with paediatric oncology is poor or non-existent and access to supportive care is limited. Multidisciplinary treatment planning enhances care and development may represent an area where external partners can help. Commitment to the use of protocols is evident, but current international guidelines may lack relevance; the development of resources that reflect the capacity and needs of LMICs is required. In some LMICs, there are already leading centres experienced in paediatric radiotherapy where patient care approximates to that in HICs. These centres have the potential to drive improvements in service, training, mentorship and research in their regions and ultimately to improve the care and outcomes for paediatric cancer patients.","Anacak Y, Zubizarreta E, Zaghloul M, Laskar S, Alert J, Gondhowiardjo S, Giselvania A, Correa-Villar R, Pedrosa F, Dorj B, Kamer S, Howard SC, Quintana Y, Ribeiro RC, Rosenblatt E, Hopkins K",Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol),2021 Apr,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
34767629,Resilient health care in global pediatric oncology during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"BACKGROUND: In the face of unprecedented challenges because of coronavirus disease 2019, interdisciplinary pediatric oncology teams have developed strategies to continue providing high-quality cancer care. This study explored factors contributing to health care resilience as perceived by childhood cancer providers in all resource level settings. METHODS: This qualitative study consisted of 19 focus groups conducted in 16 countries in 8 languages. Seven factors have been previously defined as important for resilient health care including: 1) in situ practical experience, 2) system design, 3) exposure to diverse views on the patient's situation, 4) protocols and checklists, 5) teamwork, 6) workarounds, and 7) trade-offs. Rapid turn-around analysis focused on these factors. RESULTS: All factors of health care resilience were relevant to groups representing all resource settings. Focus group participants emphasized the importance of teamwork and a flexible and coordinated approach to care. Participants described collaboration within and among institutions, as well as partnerships with governmental, private, and nonprofit organizations. Hierarchies were advantageous to decision-making and information dissemination. Clinicians were inspired by their patients and explained creative trade-offs and workarounds used to maintain high-quality care. CONCLUSIONS: Factors previously described as contributing to resilient health care manifested differently in each institution but were described in all resource settings. These insights can guide pediatric oncology teams worldwide as they provide cancer care during the next phases of the pandemic. Understanding these elements of resilience will also help providers respond to inevitable future stressors on health care systems.","Graetz DE, Sniderman E, Villegas CA, Kaye EC, Ragab I, Laptsevich A, Maliti B, Naidu G, Huang H, Gassant PY, Nunes Silva L, Arce D, Montoya Vasquez J, Arora RS, Alcasabas AP, Rusmawatiningtyas D, Raza MR, Velasco P, Kambugu J, Vinitsky A, Rodriguez-Galindo C, Agulnik A, Moreira DC",Cancer,2022 Feb 15,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
34319023,Monitoring Of High-Dose Methotrexate (Mtx)-Related Toxicity and Mtx Levels in Children with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: A Pilot-Study in Indonesia.,"The administration of high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) requires an accurate monitoring of blood MTX levels to determine the regimen of leucovorin rescue and urine alkalinization to prevent toxicity. However, it is technically and logistically challenging to screen patients routinely in limited-resource settings. This study aimed to evaluate blood MTX levels at 24- and 48-hours from start of infusion in relation to clinical toxicity in childhood ALL. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted on 32 consecutive children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who had received at least one cycle of 1 g/m2 HD-MTX intravenous infusion as a part of consolidation treatment based on the 2013 Indonesian ALL Protocol. In total, 68 cycles were evaluated. Serum MTX concentrations were measured using enzyme immunoassay. MTX toxicity was categorized using common toxicity criteria (CTCAE) 3.0 version. The association between MTX level and clinical toxicity was assessed by non-parametric analysis. RESULTS: The 24-hours MTX level was median 29.8 ng/mL (0.065 micromol/L) (IQR 8.1-390.6) with a modest decrease in 48-hours MTX serum level in all cycles (median 28.3 ng/mL and 0.062 micromol/L; IQR 0.35-28.7; p <0.05). The two most common toxicities were hepatotoxicity (32.2%) and neutropenia (30.9%). Nephrotoxicity and febrile neutropenia occurred in 8.8% and 5.8% of patients, respectively, with low percentage of mucositis (4.3%) and thrombocytopenia (5.6%) recorded.  No statistically significant association was found between MTX levels and clinical toxicity, except for liver toxicity. CONCLUSION: Serum MTX levels at 24-hours and 48-hours are low, followed by only 4.4% grade III/IV hepatotoxicity and 26,4% grade III/IV neutropenia. There is no significant association between the clinical toxicity and MTX levels at the two points of measurement. An attempt to increase the MTX dose and/or to introduce a loading dose should be considered in subsequent ALL protocol as supported by further pharmacokinetic MTX studies in the Indonesian population.","Sari NM, Rakhmilla LE, Bashari MH, Zazuli Z, Suryawan N, Susanah S, Reniarti L, Raspati H, Supriyadi E, Kaspers GJL, Idjradinata P",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2021 Jul 1,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia

A team approach, incorporating the skills of obstetricians, radiation therapists, pediatric medical oncologists and hematologists, neonatal surgeons, rehabilitation specialists, and social workers, is imperative to ensure that the patient receives the best treatment. Retinoblastoma is a relatively uncommon tumor of childhood that arises in the retina. The estimated annual incidence is between 1 in 15,000 and 1 in 34,000. Although it may occur at any age, it most often arises in younger children, with 80% of cases diagnosed before the age of 5 years. We report a case of prenatally diagnosed fetal retinoblastoma.","Salim A, Wiknjosastro GH, Danukusumo D, Barnas B, Zalud I",J Ultrasound Med,1998 Nov,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
21681925,"Incidence of childhood leukemia in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, 1998-2009.","BACKGROUND: In most developing countries, incidence data for childhood cancers are less reliable, because very few population-based registries exist. The aim of this study was to present the epidemiology of childhood leukemia in the Dr. Sardjito Hospital (DSH) region, which catchment area extends beyond the boundaries of the Yogyakarta Special Province (YSP). PROCEDURE: Health records of children, 0-14 years of age, who were diagnosed with leukemia between January 1998 and December 2009, were reviewed. Diagnosis of leukemia was confirmed by morphological and histochemical examination of marrow samples. RESULTS: The estimated average annual incidence rate (AAIR) of childhood acute leukemia in DSH was 46.2 per million per year. Interestingly, the annual incidence rate (AIR) of childhood acute leukemia from the catchment area of DSH significantly increased from 35 in 1999 to 70 in 2009 (ANOVA, P = 0.003). The YSP population data, analyzed separately, showed an increase in AIR from 15.7 to 32.9 (ANOVA, P = 0.325) and an AAIR of 28.8. Remarkably, a relatively high frequency (25.5% in DSH and 27.7% in YSP) of children with AML was found in the group of acute leukemias. CONCLUSION: The DSH incidence calculations may be overestimated due to an underestimation of the population number. Since the population count for YSP is more precise, the data of YSP were used for comparison with developed countries. AAIR of ALL (20.8) is relatively low compared to Western countries (22.4-37.9). The AAIR of AML (8.0) is similar to Western countries (5.0-8.0) resulting a relatively high percentage of AML versus ALL (27.7%) in YSP.","Supriyadi E, Widjajanto PH, Purwanto I, Cloos J, Veerman AJ, Sutaryo S",Pediatr Blood Cancer,2011 Oct,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
34373489,CREB signaling activity correlates with differentiation and survival in medulloblastoma.,"While there has been significant progress in the molecular characterization of the childhood brain cancer medulloblastoma, the tumor proteome remains less explored. However, it is important to obtain a complete understanding of medulloblastoma protein biology, since interactions between proteins represent potential new drug targets. Using previously generated phosphoprotein signaling-profiles of a large cohort of primary medulloblastoma, we discovered that phosphorylation of transcription factor CREB strongly correlates with medulloblastoma survival and associates with a differentiation phenotype. We further found that during normal cerebellar development, phosphorylated CREB was selectively expressed in differentiating cerebellar granule neuron progenitor (CGNP) cells. In line, we observed increased differentiation in CGNPs treated with Forskolin, Bmp6 and Bmp12 (Gdf7), which induce CREB phosphorylation. Lastly, we demonstrated that inducing CREB activation via PKA-mediated CREB signaling, but not Bmp/MEK/ERK mediated signalling, enhances medulloblastoma cell sensitivity to chemotherapy.","Armandari I, Zomerman WW, Plasschaert SLA, Smit MJ, Martini TEI, de Camargo Magalhaes ES, Hogeling SM, Rozema-Huizinga GC, Lourens HJ, Meeuwsen-de Boer TGJ, Scherpen FJG, de Bont ESJM, Bruggeman SWM",Sci Rep,2021 Aug 9,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia

Side effects may be an important cause of noncompliance. Fifty-one parents of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a tertiary care hospital in Indonesia were interviewed about their perception of side effects and their impact on treatment noncompliance and daily activities. A symptom checklist assessing 13 common symptoms was used to examine side effects. During chemotherapy, childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients suffered from psychological as well as physical side effects. The most frequent side effect reported by parents was behavior alteration (92%). Second and third in frequency were increased appetite and infections, reported by 88% and 83% of parents, respectively. The most severe side effects were leg weakness, increased appetite, and behavior alteration. The overall frequency of side effects was weakly correlated to noncompliance. Reducing the impact of side effects may increase compliance with the treatment.","Sitaresmi MN, Mostert S, Purwanto I, Gundy CM, Sutaryo, Veerman AJ",J Pediatr Oncol Nurs,2009 Jul-Aug,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
19011470,Parental experiences of childhood leukemia treatment in indonesia.,"In our study, we examined socioeconomic, treatment-related, and psychologic experiences of parents during the acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment of their children in an academic hospital in Indonesia. Children were treated with the WK-ALL-2000 protocol and received donated chemotherapy. From November 2004 to April 2006, 51 parents were interviewed by psychologists using semi-structured questionnaires. The family income had decreased (69%) since the start of treatment. Parents lost their jobs (29% of fathers and 8% of mothers), most of whom stated that this loss of employment was caused by the leukemia of their child (87% of fathers and 100% of mothers). Treatment costs resulted in financial difficulties (78%), debts (65%), and forced parents either to postpone or withdraw from parts of treatment (18%). Parents mentioned needing more information (86%) from and contact (77%) with doctors. The parent organization did not pay any visits (69%) during hospitalization, nor did they give information (59%) or emotional support (55%). We have concluded that the socioeconomic impact of leukemia treatment was profound. Communication between parents and doctors requires improving. The role of the parent organization was insignificant and must be ameliorated.","Mostert S, Sitaresmi MN, Gundy CM, Sutaryo, Veerman AJ",J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,2008 Oct,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
39925768,Factors Influencing Treatment-Seeking Behavior Among Caregivers of Children with Cancer: A Scoping Review.,"BACKGROUND: The survival rates for children with cancer, particularly in developing countries, remain low. A key factor contributing to these poor survival rates is the late diagnosis of pediatric cancer, which is often due to insufficient treatment-seeking behaviors by parents. This study aimed to explore the factors that influence the treatment-seeking behavior among caregivers of children with cancer. METHODS: This study employed a scoping review approach. Data was gathered from three sources: PubMed, CINAHL, and Medline. The search protocol adhered to the PRISMA guidelines for scoping reviews, using the terms (""children OR childhood"") AND (""cancer OR malignancy"") AND (""factors OR causes"") AND (""health-seeking behavior OR treatment-seeking behavior"") AND (""treatment delay""). Selected studies were based on original research, utilized either a cross-sectional or qualitative approach, focused on caregivers of children diagnosed with cancer, and were published in the last ten years (2013-2023). RESULTS: A total of nine articles met the criteria for inclusion: seven were cross-sectional studies, while two were qualitative studies. The ages of the children ranged from 1 to 18 years. Caregivers included parents (mother, father, or both), uncles, siblings, and cousins. The number of respondents varied from 12 to 200. The findings of the studies indicate that a range of complex and interrelated factors affects parental behavior, which includes child-related factors, parent-related factors, knowledge-related factors, perception-related factors, access to health services, and levels of social support. CONCLUSION: This study highlights that caregiver behavior in seeking treatment for children with cancer is influenced by various factors that all contribute to delays in the treatment. We advocate for increased health promotion initiatives by the government and policymakers aimed at enhancing parents' knowledge and awareness regarding childhood cancer and its early detection. Expanding the cancer service network in developing countries could improve public access to pediatric cancer services.","Nurhidayah I, Hendriyani D, Adistie F, Nurhaeni N, Mediani HS",J Multidiscip Healthc,2025,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
39807478,Factors Associated with Psychological Well-Being Among Children Under 18 Years Old with Cancer: A Scoping Review.,"BACKGROUND: Cancer diagnosis and treatment can have severe psychological impacts on children that can affect various aspects of their emotional, social and cognitive functioning. Many children with cancer experience long-term psychological distresses. The psychological well-being (PWB) is a critical aspect of their overall health. Understanding the factors that influence their psychological state can help in developing effective interventions to support them. PURPOSE: This scoping review aimed to identify and summarize the factors associated with PWB among children with cancer. METHODS: This study applied a scoping review using the guidelines outlined in the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases, including PubMed, CINAHL, Taylor and Francis, and Scopus. Inclusion criteria were included by keywords Psychological well-being OR Psychological AND Children OR Child OR Pediatric OR Childhood AND Adolescent OR Teenagers OR Youth AND Cancer OR Neoplasms OR Tumors OR Malignancy OR Cancer Survivors AND predictor OR factors OR determinant. Studies were included if they investigated psychological well-being in children (aged 0-18 years) with cancer. The Arksey and O'Malley framework for scoping reviews guided the methodology, including study selection, data extraction, and thematic analysis. The quality of the evidence was evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) and the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) critical appraisal checklist. RESULTS: 12 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The factors most frequently reported in several categories are age (sociodemographic), psychological function (individual factors), age at diagnosis (health and history), parent attachment and school status (environmental factors). CONCLUSION: This review found several aspects that describe the PWB of the articles reviewed. These aspects consist of anxiety, depression, distress, well-being, and self-esteem. From these aspects, many predictors were obtained, which were classified into four categories of factors related to the PWB of children with cancer.","Alya FP, Hendrawati S, Mediani HS",Psychol Res Behav Manag,2025,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
38801001,A concept for international societally relevant microbiology education and microbiology knowledge promulgation in society.,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Microbes are all pervasive in their distribution and influence on the functioning and well-being of humans, life in general and the planet. Microbially-based technologies contribute hugely to the supply of important goods and services we depend upon, such as the provision of food, medicines and clean water. They also offer mechanisms and strategies to mitigate and solve a wide range of problems and crises facing humanity at all levels, including those encapsulated in the sustainable development goals (SDGs) formulated by the United Nations. For example, microbial technologies can contribute in multiple ways to decarbonisation and hence confronting global warming, provide sanitation and clean water to the billions of people lacking them, improve soil fertility and hence food production and develop vaccines and other medicines to reduce and in some cases eliminate deadly infections. They are the foundation of biotechnology, an increasingly important and growing business sector and source of employment, and the centre of the bioeconomy, Green Deal, etc. But, because microbes are largely invisible, they are not familiar to most people, so opportunities they offer to effectively prevent and solve problems are often missed by decision-makers, with the negative consequences this entrains. To correct this lack of vital knowledge, the International Microbiology Literacy Initiative-the IMiLI-is recruiting from the global microbiology community and making freely available, teaching resources for a curriculum in societally relevant microbiology that can be used at all levels of learning. Its goal is the development of a society that is literate in relevant microbiology and, as a consequence, able to take full advantage of the potential of microbes and minimise the consequences of their negative activities. In addition to teaching about microbes, almost every lesson discusses the influence they have on sustainability and the SDGs and their ability to solve pressing problems of societal inequalities. The curriculum thus teaches about sustainability, societal needs and global citizenship. The lessons also reveal the impacts microbes and their activities have on our daily lives at the personal, family, community, national and global levels and their relevance for decisions at all levels. And, because effective, evidence-based decisions require not only relevant information but also critical and systems thinking, the resources also teach about these key generic aspects of deliberation. The IMiLI teaching resources are learner-centric, not academic microbiology-centric and deal with the microbiology of everyday issues. These span topics as diverse as owning and caring for a companion animal, the vast range of everyday foods that are produced via microbial processes, impressive geological formations created by microbes, childhood illnesses and how they are managed and how to reduce waste and pollution. They also leverage the exceptional excitement of exploration and discovery that typifies much progress in microbiology to capture the interest, inspire and motivate educators and learners alike. The IMiLI is establishing Regional Centres to translate the teaching resources into regional languages and adapt them to regional cultures, and to promote their use and assist educators employing them. Two of these are now operational. The Regional Centres constitute the interface between resource creators and educators-learners. As such, they will collect and analyse feedback from the end-users and transmit this to the resource creators so that teaching materials can be improved and refined, and new resources added in response to demand: educators and learners will thereby be directly involved in evolution of the teaching resources. The interactions between educators-learners and resource creators mediated by the Regional Centres will establish dynamic and synergistic relationships-a global societally relevant microbiology education ecosystem-in which creators also become learners, teaching resources are optimised and all players/stakeholders are empowered and their motivation increased. The IMiLI concept thus embraces the principle of teaching societally relevant microbiology embedded in the wider context of societal, biosphere and planetary needs, inequalities, the range of crises that confront us and the need for improved decisioning, which should ultimately lead to better citizenship and a humanity that is more sustainable and resilient. ABSTRACT: The biosphere of planet Earth is a microbial world: a vast reactor of countless microbially driven chemical transformations and energy transfers that push and pull many planetary geochemical processes, including the cycling of the elements of life, mitigate or amplify climate change (e.g., Nature Reviews Microbiology, 2019, 17, 569) and impact the well-being and activities of all organisms, including humans. Microbes are both our ancestors and creators of the planetary chemistry that allowed us to evolve (e.g., Life's engines: How microbes made earth habitable, 2023). To understand how the biosphere functions, how humans can influence its development and live more sustainably with the other organisms sharing it, we need to understand the microbes. In a recent editorial (Environmental Microbiology, 2019, 21, 1513), we advocated for improved microbiology literacy in society. Our concept of microbiology literacy is not based on knowledge of the academic subject of microbiology, with its multitude of component topics, plus the growing number of additional topics from other disciplines that become vitally important elements of current microbiology. Rather it is focused on microbial activities that impact us-individuals/communities/nations/the human world-and the biosphere and that are key to reaching informed decisions on a multitude of issues that regularly confront us, ranging from personal issues to crises of global importance. In other words, it is knowledge and understanding essential for adulthood and the transition to it, knowledge and understanding that must be acquired early in life in school. The 2019 Editorial marked the launch of the International Microbiology Literacy Initiative, the IMiLI. HERE, WE PRESENT: our concept of how microbiology literacy may be achieved and the rationale underpinning it; the type of teaching resources being created to realise the concept and the framing of microbial activities treated in these resources in the context of sustainability, societal needs and responsibilities and decision-making; and the key role of Regional Centres that will translate the teaching resources into local languages, adapt them according to local cultural needs, interface with regional educators and develop and serve as hubs of microbiology literacy education networks. The topics featuring in teaching resources are learner-centric and have been selected for their inherent relevance, interest and ability to excite and engage. Importantly, the resources coherently integrate and emphasise the overarching issues of sustainability, stewardship and critical thinking and the pervasive interdependencies of processes. More broadly, the concept emphasises how the multifarious applications of microbial activities can be leveraged to promote human/animal, plant, environmental and planetary health, improve social equity, alleviate humanitarian deficits and causes of conflicts among peoples and increase understanding between peoples (Microbial Biotechnology, 2023, 16(6), 1091-1111). Importantly, although the primary target of the freely available (CC BY-NC 4.0) IMiLI teaching resources is schoolchildren and their educators, they and the teaching philosophy are intended for all ages, abilities and cultural spectra of learners worldwide: in university education, lifelong learning, curiosity-driven, web-based knowledge acquisition and public outreach.

METHODS: Data collected 2001 to 2016 from PHIVA 10-19 years of age within a regional Asian cohort were analyzed using competing risk time-to-event and Poisson regression analyses to describe the nature and incidence of morbidity events and hospitalizations and identify factors associated with disease-related, treatment-related and overall morbidity. Morbidity was defined according to World Health Organization clinical staging criteria and U.S. National Institutes of Health Division of AIDS criteria. RESULTS: A total 3,448 PHIVA contributed 17,778 person-years. Median age at HIV diagnosis was 5.5 years, and ART initiation was 6.9 years. There were 2,562 morbidity events and 307 hospitalizations. Cumulative incidence for any morbidity was 51.7%, and hospitalization was 10.0%. Early adolescence was dominated by disease-related infectious morbidity, with a trend toward noninfectious and treatment-related morbidity in later adolescence. Higher overall morbidity rates were associated with a CD4 count <350 cells/microL, HIV viral load >/=10,000 copies/mL and experiencing prior morbidity at age <10 years. Lower overall morbidity rates were found for those 15-19 years of age compared with 10-14 years and those who initiated ART at age 5-9 years compared with <5 or >/=10 years. CONCLUSIONS: Half of our PHIVA cohort experienced a morbidity event, with a trend from disease-related infectious events to treatment-related and noninfectious events as PHIVA age. ART initiation to prevent immune system damage, optimize virologic control and minimize childhood morbidity are key to limiting adolescent morbidity.","Bartlett AW, Mohamed TJ, Sudjaritruk T, Kurniati N, Nallusamy R, Hansudewechakul R, Ly PS, Truong KH, Lumbiganon P, Puthanakit T, Chokephaibulkit K, Nguyen LV, Do VC, Kumarasamy N, Nik Yusoff NK, Fong MS, Wati DK, Sohn AH, Kariminia A",Pediatr Infect Dis J,2019 Mar,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
35728910,"Epidemiology of community-acquired pneumonia among hospitalised children in Indonesia: a multicentre, prospective study.","OBJECTIVE: To identify aetiologies of childhood community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) based on a comprehensive diagnostic approach. DESIGN: 'Partnerships for Enhanced Engagement in Research-Pneumonia in Paediatrics (PEER-PePPeS)' study was an observational prospective cohort study conducted from July 2017 to September 2019. SETTING: Government referral teaching hospitals and satellite sites in three cities in Indonesia: Semarang, Yogyakarta and Tangerang. PARTICIPANTS: Hospitalised children aged 2-59 months who met the criteria for pneumonia were eligible. Children were excluded if they had been hospitalised for >24 hours; had malignancy or history of malignancy; a history of long-term (>2 months) steroid therapy, or conditions that might interfere with compliance with study procedures. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Causative bacterial, viral or mixed pathogen(s) for pneumonia were determined using microbiological, molecular and serological tests from routinely collected specimens (blood, sputum and nasopharyngeal swabs). We applied a previously published algorithm (PEER-PePPeS rules) to determine the causative pathogen(s). RESULTS: 188 subjects were enrolled. Based on our algorithm, 48 (25.5%) had a bacterial infection, 31 (16.5%) had a viral infection, 76 (40.4%) had mixed bacterial and viral infections, and 33 (17.6%) were unable to be classified. The five most common causative pathogens identified were Haemophilus influenzae non-type B (N=73, 38.8%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (N=51, 27.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (N=43, 22.9%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (N=29, 15.4%) and Influenza virus (N=25, 13.3%). RSV and influenza virus diagnoses were highly associated with Indonesia's rainy season (November-March). The PCR assays on induced sputum (IS) specimens captured most of the pathogens identified in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that H. influenzae non-type B and RSV were the most frequently identified pathogens causing hospitalised CAP among Indonesian children aged 2-59 months old. Our study also highlights the importance of PCR for diagnosis and by extension, appropriate use of antimicrobials.

18816641,Health-care providers' compliance with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia protocol in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Non-compliance with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) protocol is an important determinant of poor treatment outcome. Non-compliance with protocol may not only concern parents or patients, but may also concern health-care providers (HCP). Our study examines the accuracy of leukemia risk classification and attitude of HCP toward protocol compliance in Indonesia. PROCEDURE: A combined retrospective study of medical records (MR) and a cross-sectional questionnaire study with HCP were conducted. Accurate ALL risk classification in MR was assessed. HCP' knowledge of risk classification and their attitude toward protocol compliance were examined. RESULTS: A total of 164 MR patients with ALL were assessed and 97 HCP were interviewed. The protocol criteria for high-risk (HR) were not complete in 82 MR (50%). Of 97 HCP, 95% did not mention all five protocol criteria for HR. Both in the MR as well as in the questionnaires lymphoblast count on day 8 of chemotherapy, as early response to treatment, was the most frequently missed item (missing in 35% of MR and 85% of questionnaires). Only 14% of respondents actually checked with parents whether they administered the prescribed medicines. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that HCP should improve their knowledge and assessment of childhood ALL risk classification, especially lymphoblast count on day 8 of chemotherapy. Proper risk classification and subsequent correct treatment may enable more children to be cured of leukemia.","Sitaresmi MN, Mostert S, Gundy CM, Sutaryo, Veerman AJ",Pediatr Blood Cancer,2008 Dec,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
35633553,Relationship between Bax and Bcl-2 Protein Expression and Outcome of Induction Phase Chemotherapy in Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,"BACKGROUND: Overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 causes apoptosis to stop and conversely the increased expression of the proapoptotic protein Bax makes lymphoblasts easy to destroy. The Bax/Bcl-2 ratio plays a role in the balance of apoptosis, immortality, resistance, and outcome of chemotherapy. We analyzed the relationship between the Bax/BCl-2 ratio and the outcome of induction phase chemotherapy in pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). METHODS: This research was conducted with a prospective observational study on pediatric ALL aged 1-18 years who were newly diagnosed based on bone marrow aspiration (morphology and immunophenotyping) at Dr. Soetomo General Hospital, Surabaya on October 2020 to March 2021. Expression of Bcl-2, Bax, and Bax/Bcl-2 protein ratio was measured by the flow cytometry method from lymphoblast on bone marrow aspirate samples before and after induction phase chemotherapy according to the 2018 Childhood ALL Indonesian Protocol. The outcomes evaluated were survival and remission rate (lymphoblasts in the bone marrow less than 5%). We used the Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon Signed Rank test to analyze the differences between protein expression with p<0.05 for a two-tailed test. RESULTS: We included 17/26 pediatric ALL, consisting of 88% male, 94% LLA-L1, 76% B cell ALL and 24% T cell ALL. Mean expression of Bax, Bcl-2, and Bax/Bcl-2 protein ratio before chemotherapy among pediatric ALL who alive (N=11) and dead (N=6) were not significantly different (p>0.05). All children who completed the induction phase of chemotherapy went into remission. Bax and Bcl-2 expression before and after chemotherapy showed no difference (p>0.05). The Bax/Bcl-2 ratio increased from 1.74(SD 1.846) to 6.17(4.139) with p=0.021. CONCLUSION: Expression of Bax, Bcl-2, and Bax/Bcl-2 protein ratio at the beginning of diagnosis did not affect the survival of pediatric ALL after the induction phase of chemotherapy. The Bax/Bcl-2 protein ratio increased 3.5 times in pediatric ALL with remission outcomes, indicating proapoptotic dominance.","Cahyadi A, Ugrasena IDG, Andarsini MR, Larasati MCS, Aryati A, Arumsari DK",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2022 May 1,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
32949805,Congenital Midline Spinal Hamartoma in a 5-Month-Old Infant.,"BACKGROUND: Congenital midline spinal hamartoma is a very rare tumor-like proliferation that mostly occurs during childhood. It consists of mature, well-differentiated ectodermal and mesodermal elements that present in an abnormal location and are mostly associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 and spinal dysraphism. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 5-month-old male patient presented with complaint of a bump over the lower back. The bump was already present since birth with the size of approximately 3 cm in diameter and slow growth. There were no other associated symptoms besides the bump on the lower back. In the physical examination, we found a subcutaneous mass with associated skin dimple located on the midline of the lower back. Computed tomography scan of the spine showed a mass that arose from inside the dura and a closed spinal dysraphism from L3 vertebra to the sacrum. A subtotal resection was performed, and the histopathology feature showed fat cells, cartilage, skeletal muscle fibers, nerve, and blood vessel. After 6 months follow-up, no symptoms or neurologic deficit were present, and no further growth was shown on the latest computed tomography scan. CONCLUSIONS: Congenital midline spinal hamartoma is very rare and seldom addressed. Most patients present with a cosmetic defect and rarely with associated symptoms. Tissue biopsy is still the best modality to definitively diagnose hamartoma and to exclude other diagnoses. Surgical excision of the tumor is still the mainstay treatment, especially for patients who are not neurologically intact and to correct the cosmetic skin defect.","Malelak EB, Lauren C, Argie D, Nugraheni T",World Neurosurg,2021 Jan,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
38800077,A case report of a childhood scurvy musculoskeletal manifestation: Radiologic findings and diagnostic implications.,"Scurvy is an infrequent pathological condition resulting from a sustained dietary vitamin C deficiency. Radiology becomes pivotal because the diagnostic process for scurvy can be intricate, given its resemblance to bone neoplasms. A 6-year-old boy, reported persistent pain and swelling in the right thigh for 2 months prior to hospitalization. Clinical examination revealed a mass localized in the right thigh and anemia. A radiograph of the right femur demonstrated extensive osteopenic changes, ""Trummerfeld zone"", ""Frankel line"", ""Pelkin fracture"", ""Wimberger ring sign"", and para-epiphyseal subperiosteal hematoma. The absence of any such cases in our institution over the preceding decade emphasizes the uniqueness of this presentation. Histopathological evaluation yielded atypical results, prompting further radiographic assessment of the left femur and thorax. The subsequent findings corroborated the classic ""scorbutic rosary"" presentation, indicative of scurvy. The patient's symptoms gradually resolved with high-dose supplementation of vitamin C. Scurvy predominantly presents with musculoskeletal manifestations. Plasma vitamin C level assessment is the gold standard for the diagnosis, but it is currently inaccessible in our nation. Consequently, radiographic evaluation reveals pathognomonic features of the disorder. In thoracic radiographs, the ""scorbutic rosary"" presentation is evident. In contrast, long bones exhibit hallmarks of scurvy: diffuse osteopenia, ""Frankel line"", ""Trummerfeld zone"", ""Pelkin fracture"", ""Wimberger ring sign"", and para-epiphyseal subperiosteal hematoma. Prompt intervention with vitamin C thwarts the progression to severe complications. Radiology is an indispensable tool in diagnosing pediatric scurvy, especially in developmental countries where the assessment of vitamin C serum levels is inaccessible.","Susilo F, Clarissa S, Handoyono QF, Simargi Y, Ronny, Nurprasetyo",Radiol Case Rep,2024 Aug,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
37723843,Infantile Fibrosarcoma in Older Child at Right Lower Leg: A Case Report.,"BACKGROUND Infantile fibrosarcoma (IFS) is a rare tumor. The highest prevalence is in the first 2 years of life. Cases typically manifest in the extremities, with rapid initial growth, are non-tender, and are a poorly delimited masses that vary in size or consistency and lack sensitivity. The treatment for IFS is a multimodal approach, and surgical excision has become the main treatment. This report aims to present the results of our work on IFS cases. CASE REPORT A 4-year-old girl was admitted to our hospital with a chief concern of a mass in the right lower leg that first appeared 3 years ago. Physical examination showed a single mass with dense-rubbery consistency, tenderness, and limited range of motion. Plain radiography was performed, and a soft-tissue mass was seen on the anterior 1/3 distal cruris of the right side. CT angiography showed a bulging soft-tissue mass, solid (38 HU), with size +/-2.8x3.1x4.7 cm. MRI examination revealed an aggressive superficial soft-tissue mass in the cutaneous-subcutaneous compartment. Biopsy and immunohistochemistry were performed, and the results were consistent with IFS. A local excision was made to assess for pathological anatomy. CONCLUSIONS Infantile fibrosarcoma (IFS) is an uncommon tumor in early childhood. It tends to mimic other tumors, which may interfere with the correct diagnosis, which may contribute to its rarity. Local excision is the first treatment choice, with a good prognosis for IFS.","Irsan II, Isma SPP, Mahendra AS",Am J Case Rep,2023 Sep 19,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
29801409,Implementation of Medication Safety Practice in Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment.,"Objective: Medical Safety Practice (MSP) is a safe procedure in medication process. It is important to investigate the use of MSP among childhood cancer patients because pediatric oncology is a high-risk area for potentially harmful adverse events. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of the implementation of MSP in chemotherapy on the incidence of medication errors in childhood ALL patient at Dr. Sardjito Hospital, including in 1) transcribing, 2) administering, 3) monitoring, 4) the incidence of adverse drugs events. (ADEs). Methods: The study design is a quasi-experimental study with pre- and post-intervention without control. The sample consists of ALL patients who are taken care of at an academic hospital in Indonesia from 2012 to 2013. The sample was consecutively collected during the period of study. The data were collected through medical records, research form, observation, and discussion with the nurse. The intervention given is training and implementation of medical safety practice in chemotherapy. Result: Based on the analysis of the effect of the implementation of MSP (75 and 106 medical records of pre- and post-intervention), it is obtained: 1) the adherence of chemotherapy transcribing post-intervention increases significantly compared to pre-intervention (p<0.05), 2) the adherence of chemotherapy administering increases significantly in almost every aspect (p<0.05), except in preparing drugs by two different health worker, patient's confirmation of ADEs management, and verification of drug's expired date, 3) The adherence of chemotherapy monitoring improved significantly post-intervention (p<0.05), 4) Adverse Drug Events (ADE) decreased significantly post-intervention (p<0.05), from 52.1% to 30.5%. Conclusion: The implementation of MSP decreased the incidence of medication errors in ALL patients at Dr. Sardjito Hospital in ordering, dispensing, transcribing, administering, and monitoring chemotherapy. It also reduced the incidence of ADEs related to chemotherapy. Specific training for nurses are needed in order to improve the knowledge and skills, especially for medication error and skill in patients' care.","Mulatsih S, Dwiprahasto I, Sutaryo",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2018 May 26,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
22892608,Transfusion-dependent anaemia of undetermined origin: a distinctive syndrome in paediatric medical tourism.,"INTRODUCTION: The underlying diagnosis of severe anaemic illnesses in children may not be easy to identify at times, especially when regular blood transfusion has been started. MATERIALS AND METHODS: International children patients attending a haematology clinic for diagnostic evaluation were identified retrospectively if they had to receive repeated blood transfusions with an undiagnosed illness or an incorrect diagnosis. Their demographic data, presenting features, and eventual diagnosis were described. RESULTS: Twelve children including 7 boys were enrolled from March 2007 to August 2011. Five came from Vietnam; 2 each came from Bangladesh and Indonesia; and 1 each from Hong Kong, Myanmar, and Ukraine. Their illnesses started at a mean age of 1.5 years (0.1 to 6.6) and they had been receiving blood transfusion for a mean duration of 2.5 years (0.1 to 9.9) years prior to the evaluation. Thalassemia major was the fi rst diagnosis in 5 cases; one had been treated for autoimmune haemolytic anaemia while the rest had not been given a diagnosis. After the evaluation, 4 children were diagnosed with Diamond Blackfan anaemia, 3 were diagnosed with hereditary spherocytosis, and one each with hereditary pyropoikilocytosis, congenital sideroblastic anaemia, congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, transient erythroblastopenia of childhood, and autoimmune myelofibrosis associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection. CONCLUSION: A definitive diagnosis can be identified in this cohort of children on medical tourism with severe anaemic illnesses requiring repeated transfusions with diagnostic approaches that circumvent the interference of transfused cells.",Lee AC,Ann Acad Med Singap,2012 Jul,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
23621253,Exploring recommendations for an effective smoking prevention program for indonesian adolescents.,"BACKGROUND: The present qualitative study assessed the need, acceptability and appropriateness for implementing effective and culturally appropriate smoking prevention programs for adolescents in schools in Indonesia. METHODS: Snowball sampling was used to recruit participants. The study sample comprised a mixture of staff in the education department, junior high school teachers and individuals who had taught junior high school students in Aceh Province, Indonesia. Data were collected through one hour in-depth face to face or telephone interviews and analyzed using a descriptive content analysis procedure. RESULTS: School teachers and policy makers in education firmly supported the implementation of a school-based smoking prevention program in Aceh. An appropriate intervention for smoking prevention program in schools in Aceh should involve both health and Islamic based approaches, and be provided by teachers and external providers. Potential barriers to the program included smoker teachers and parents, time constraints of students and/or teachers, lack of teachers' ability, increase in students' load, the availability of tobacco advertising and sales, and lack of tobacco regulation and support from community and related departments. To increase program effectiveness, involvement of and coordination with other relevant parties are needed. CONCLUSIONS: The important stakeholders in Indonesian childhood education agreed that school-based smoking prevention program would be appropriate for junior high school students. An appropriate intervention for smoking prevention program for adolescents in schools in Indonesia should be appropriate to participants' background and involve all relevant parties.","Tahlil T, Coveney J, Woodman RJ, Ward PR",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2013,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
29741267,"Health-care providers' perspectives on health-insurance access, waiving procedures, and hospital detention practices in Kenya.","BACKGROUND: Patients at Kenyan public hospitals are detained if their families cannot pay their medical bills. Access to health insurance and waiving procedures to prevent detention may be limited. This study explores the perspectives of health-care providers (HCP) on health-insurance access, waiving procedures, and hospital detention practices. PROCEDURE: A self-administered structured questionnaire was completed by 104 HCP (response rate 78%) involved in childhood cancer care. RESULTS: The perspectives of respondents were as follows: all children with cancer should have health insurance according to 96% of HCP. After parents apply for health insurance, it takes too long before treatment costs are covered (67% agree). Patients with childhood cancer without health insurance have a higher chance of abandoning treatment (82% agree). Hospitals should waive bills of all children with cancer when parents have payment difficulties (69% agree). Waiving procedures take too long (75%). Parents are scared by waiving procedures and may decide never to return to the hospital again (68%). Poor families delay visiting the hospital because they fear hospital detention and first seek alternative treatment (92%). When poor families finally come to the hospital, the disease is in advanced stage already (94%). Parents sometimes have to abandon their detained child at the hospital if they cannot pay hospital bills (68%). Detention of children at the hospital if parents cannot pay their medical bills is not approved by 84% of HCP. CONCLUSIONS: HCP acknowledge that access to health insurance needs improvement and that waiving procedures contribute to treatment abandonment. By far, most HCP disapprove of hospital detention practices. These factors warrant urgent attention and adjustment.","Mostert S, Njuguna F, van der Burgt RHM, Musimbi J, Langat S, Skiles J, Seijffert A, Sitaresmi MN, Vik TA, van de Ven PM, Kaspers GJL",Pediatr Blood Cancer,2018 Aug,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
34048168,Risk Factors of Daunorubicine Induced Early Cardiotoxicity in Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: A Retrospective Study.,"BACKGROUND: Daunorubicine, a type of anthracycline, is a drug commonly used in cancer chemotherapy that increases survival rate but consequently compromises with cardiovascular outcomes in some patients. Thus, preventing the early progression of cardiotoxicity is important to improve the treatment outcome in childhood acute lymhoblastic leukemia (ALL). OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to identify the risk factors in anthracycline-induced early cardiotoxicity in childhood ALL. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted by observing ALL-diagnosed children from 2014 to 2019 in Dr. Soetomo General Hospital. There were 49 patients who met the inclusion criteria and were treated with chemotherapy using Indonesian Childhood ALL Protocol 2013. Echocardiography was performed by pediatric cardiologists to compare before and at any given time after anthracycline therapy. Early cardiotoxicity was defined as a decline of left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than 10% with a final LVEF < 53% during the first year of anthracycline administration.  Risk factors such as sex, age, risk stratification group, and cumulative dose were identified by using multiple logistic regression. Diagnostic performance of cumulative anthracycline dose was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: Early anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity was observed in 5 out of 49 patients. The median cumulative dose of anthracycline was 143.69+/-72.68 mg/m2. Thirty-three patients experienced a decreasing LVEF. The factors associated with early cardiomyopathy were age of >/= 4 years (PR= 1.128; 95% CI: 1.015-1.254; p= 0.001), high risk group (PR= 1.135; 95% CI: 1.016-1.269; p= 0.001), and cumulative dose of >/=120 mg / m2 (CI= 1.161; 95% CI:1.019-1.332). CONCLUSION: Age of >/= 4 years, risk group, and cumulative dose of >/=120 mg/m2 are significant risk factors for early cardiomyopathy in childhood ALL.","Samosir SM, Utamayasa IKA, Andarsini MR, Rahman MA, Ontoseno T, Hidayat T, Ugrasena IDG, Larasati MCS, Cahyadi A",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2021 May 1,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
34123961,"Approach to Identifying Causative Pathogens of Community-Acquired Pneumonia in Children Using Culture, Molecular, and Serology Tests.","Determining the causative pathogen(s) of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children remains a challenge despite advances in diagnostic methods. Currently available guidelines generally recommend empiric antimicrobial therapy when the specific etiology is unknown. However, shifts in epidemiology, emergence of new pathogens, and increasing antimicrobial resistance underscore the importance of identifying causative pathogen(s). Although viral CAP among children is increasingly recognized, distinguishing viral from bacterial etiologies remains difficult. Obtaining high quality samples from infected lung tissue is typically the limiting factor. Additionally, interpretation of results from routinely collected specimens (blood, sputum, and nasopharyngeal swabs) is complicated by bacterial colonization and prolonged shedding of incidental respiratory viruses. Using current literature on assessment of CAP causes in children, we developed an approach for identifying the most likely causative pathogen(s) using blood and sputum culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and paired serology. Our proposed rules do not rely on carriage prevalence data from controls. We herein share our perspective in order to help clinicians and researchers classify and manage childhood pneumonia.","Mardian Y, Menur Naysilla A, Lokida D, Farida H, Aman AT, Karyana M, Lukman N, Kosasih H, Kline A, Lau CY",Front Pediatr,2021,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
18992169,Health-related quality of life assessment in Indonesian childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"BACKGROUND: Most studies on Health-related Quality of Life (HRQOL) in children with cancer were conducted in developed countries. The aims of this study were to assess the HRQOL in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients in Indonesia and to assess the influence of demographic and medical characteristics on HRQOL. METHODS: After cultural linguistic validation, a cross-sectional study of HRQOL was conducted with childhood ALL patients and their guardians in various phases of treatment using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 4.0 Generic Core Scale and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 3.0 Cancer Module. RESULTS: Ninety-eight guardians and 55 patients participated. The internal consistency of both scales ranged from 0.57 to 0.92. HRQOL of Indonesian patients was comparable with those in developed countries. There were moderate to good correlations between self-reports and proxy-reports, however guardians tended to report worse HRQOL than patients. Children of the 2-5 year-group significantly had more problems in procedural anxiety, treatment anxiety and communication subscales than in older groups (p < 0.05). In the non-intensive phase HRQOL was significantly better than in the intensive phase, both in patient self-reports and proxy-reports. CONCLUSION: Younger children had more problems in procedural anxiety, treatment anxiety and communication subscales. Therefore, special care during intervention procedures is needed to promote their normal development. Psychosocial support should be provided to children and their parents to facilitate their coping with disease and its treatment.","Sitaresmi MN, Mostert S, Gundy CM, Sutaryo, Veerman AJ",Health Qual Life Outcomes,2008 Nov 9,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
17676594,Attitude of health-care providers toward childhood leukemia patients with different socio-economic status.,"BACKGROUND: Treatment results differ significantly between poor and prosperous children with leukemia in Indonesia. The objective of this study was to determine whether parental socio-economic status influences beliefs, attitude, and behavior of health-care providers (hcp) treating childhood leukemia in Indonesia. PROCEDURE: A self-administered semi-structured questionnaire was filled in by 102 hcp (69 doctors, 28 nurses, 2 psychologists, 2 hematology technicians, 1 administrator). RESULTS: Most hcp (98%) asked parents about their financial situation. The decision to start treatment was influenced by parental socio-economic status (86%), motivation of parents (80%), and motivation of doctors (76%). Health-care providers stated that prosperous patients comply better with treatment (64%), doctors comply better with treatment for the prosperous (53%), most patients cannot afford to complete treatment (58%), less extensive explanations are given toward poor families (60%), and communication is impeded by differences in status (67%). When dealing with prosperous families a minority of hcp stated that they pay more attention (27%), work with greater accuracy (24%), take more interest (23%), and devote more time per visit (22%). Most hcp denied differences in the quality of medical care (93%) and the chances of cure (58%) between poor and prosperous patients. CONCLUSIONS: Beliefs, attitude, and behavior of hcp toward poor versus prosperous patients appeared to differ. These differences may contribute to the immense drop-out rate and slight chances of survival among poor patients with leukemia in developing countries.","Mostert S, Sitaresmi MN, Gundy CM, Veerman AJ",Pediatr Blood Cancer,2008 May,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
32705581,Aberrantly expressed Bruton's tyrosine kinase preferentially drives metastatic and stem cell-like phenotypes in neuroblastoma cells.,"PURPOSE: Neuroblastoma, a common childhood tumor, remains one of the most elusive diseases to treat. To date, high-risk neuroblastoma is associated with low survival rates. To address this, novel and more effective therapeutic strategies must continue to be explored. METHODS: We employed a bioinformatics approach corroborated with in vitro and in vivo data. Samples from neuroblastoma patients were retrieved and immuno-stained for Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). To evaluate its effect on cellular functions, BTK expression in SK-N-BE(2) and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells was downregulated using gene silencing or inhibition with ibrutinib or acalabrutinib. Xenograft mouse models were used to investigate the in vivo role of BTK in neuroblastoma tumorigenesis. RESULTS: We found that BTK was highly expressed in primary neuroblastoma samples, preferentially in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cases, and was associated with a poor prognosis. Immunohistochemical staining of tissues from our neuroblastoma cohort revealed a strong BTK immunoreactivity. We also found that neuroblastoma SK-N-BE(2) and SH-SY5Y cells were sensitive to treatment with ibrutinib and acalabrutinib. Pharmacologic or molecular inhibition of BTK elicited a reduction in the migratory and invasive abilities of neuroblastoma cells, and ibrutinib considerably attenuated the neurosphere-forming ability of neuroblastoma cells. Both inhibitors showed synergism with cisplatin. In vivo assays showed that acalabrutinib effectively inhibited neuroblastoma tumorigenesis. CONCLUSIONS: From our data we conclude that BTK is a therapeutically targetable driver of neuroblastoma.","Pikatan NW, Liu YL, Bamodu OA, Hsiao M, Hsu WM, Haryana SM, Sutaryo, Chao TY, Yeh CT",Cell Oncol (Dordr),2020 Dec,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
39068576,Unraveling Copy Number Alterations in Pediatric B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: Correlation with Induction Phase Remission Using MLPA.,"OBJECTIVE: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy occurring in children. Copy number alterations (CNA) like PAX5, CDKN2A/2B, PAR1 Region, ETV6, IKZF1, BTG1, and RB1 gene deletion are important genetic events that define and prognosticate B-cell ALL. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate associations of CNA with induction phase remission status in childhood B-cell ALL. METHODS: This study was observational with a cross-sectional design at the Dharmais Cancer Hospital, Harapan Kita Mother and Children Hospital, and Tangerang Regional Public Hospital. We evaluated 74 pediatric B-cell ALL cases with 1-18-year-olds. Genomic DNA was analyzed by Multiplex Ligation Dependent Probe Amplification Assay (MLPA). This study used the P335 ALL-IKZF1 panel kit, which contains several ALL-related genes. The patient's clinical and laboratory characteristics were collected from medical records from January to December 2019. RESULT: We observed gene copy number alteration in children with B-Cell ALL. PAX5 was the most commonly observed gene deletion, followed by CDKN21/2B, ETV6, IKZF1, BTG1, RB1, and PAR1 Region. Based on gene mutations, only the PAX5 had a significant association with the remission status of pediatric B-cell ALL (p-value <0.05; OR = 3.91). It showed that patients with PAX5 gene mutations have 3.9 times the risk of no remission and/or relapse compared to those without PAX5 gene mutations. CONCLUSION: Patients with mutations in the PAX5 gene have a higher chance of not achieving remission and/or experiencing relapse than those without such mutations. The MLPA method can be utilized for examining copy number alterations, which is valuable for achieving more precise stratification in diagnosis.. Further research is needed to expand upon this finding.","Aisyi M, Andriastuti M, Kosasih AS, Utomo ARH, Saputra F, Tjitra Sari T, Sjakti HA, Dwijayanti F, Harimurti K, Gatot D",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2024 Jul 1,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
39715306,Geocultural differences in preschooler sleep profiles and family practices: an analysis of pooled data from 37 countries.,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To examine (1) multidimensional sleep profiles in preschoolers (3-6 years) across geocultural regions and (2) differences in sleep characteristics and family practices between Majority World regions (Pacific Islands, Sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, and Latin America) and the Minority World (the Western world). METHODS: Participants were 3507 preschoolers from 37 countries. Nighttime sleep characteristics and nap duration (accelerometer: n = 1950) and family practices (parental questionnaire) were measured. Mixed models were used to estimate the marginal means of sleep characteristics by region and examine the differences. RESULTS: Geocultural region explained up to 30% of variance in sleep characteristics. A pattern of short nighttime sleep duration, low sleep efficiency, and long nap duration was observed in Eastern Europe, Northeast Asia, and Southeast Asia. The second pattern, with later sleep midpoints and greater night-to-night sleep variability, was observed in South Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, and Latin America. Compared to the Minority World, less optimal sleep characteristics were observed in several Majority World regions, with medium-to-large effect sizes (mid R:dmid R:=0.48-2.35). Several Majority World regions reported more frequent parental smartphone use during bedtime routines (Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia: 0.77-0.99 units) and were more likely to have electronic devices in children's bedroom (Eastern Europe, Latin America, South Asia: OR = 5.97-16.57) and co-sleeping arrangement (Asia, Latin America: OR = 7.05-49.86), compared to the Minority World. CONCLUSIONS: Preschoolers' sleep profiles and related family practices vary across geocultural regions, which should be considered in sleep health promotion initiatives and policies.","Zhang Z, Abdeta C, Chelly MS, Del Pozo-Cruz J, Draper CE, Engberg E, Florindo A, Germana L, Ghofranipour F, Guan H, Ha AS, Hamdouchi AE, Tang HK, Hossain MS, Jambaldorj B, Kim DH, Koh D, Kontsevaya A, Lof M, Lubree H, Jauregui A, Munambah N, Mwase-Vuma T, Oluwayomi A, Pham BN, Reilly JJ, Staiano AE, Suherman A, Tanaka C, Tanui S, Teo WP, Tremblay MS, Turab A, Uzicanin E, Veldman SLC, Webster EK, Wickramasinghe VP, Widyastari DA, Okely A",Sleep,2025 Apr 11,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
29686177,Bilateral Giant Renal Angiomyolipoma in a Patient with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex: A Case Report.,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) has several renal manifestations including angiomyolipomas (AML) and renal epithelial neoplasms. A bilateral giant renal AML is extremely rare. We report a case of giant bilateral AML and discuss the diagnosis and treatment of it. The 22-year-old man was admitted due to bilateral flank pain, gross hematuria, and abdominal fullness. He had history of epilepsy, mental retardation, and delayed development during childhood. He had angiofibroma on his face since 10 years ago. Abdominal CT and MRI revealed large lobulated heterogeneous mass with fatty content. Based on those findings, we diagnosed the patient with bilateral giant renal AML. We gave conservative management for the patient and planned to total nephrectomy on the left kidney if the continued bleeding occurred. AML associated with TSC occur more frequently as multiple lesions and grows to larger size than idiopathic AML. Bilateral giant AML, which is very rare, could be treated with conservative management if no significant hemorrhage occurred.","Afriansyah A, Yusuf AM, Nusaly H",Acta Med Indones,2018 Jan,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
23389497,L-asparaginase: long-term results of a randomized trial of the effect of additional 3 doses during consolidation treatment in the Indonesian WK-ALL-2000 protocol.,"We conducted a randomized trial to compare the influence of 3 additional doses of L-asparaginase on clinical outcome of newly diagnosed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Patients were treated using Indonesian WK-ALL-2000 protocol between 1999 and 2005 and randomized to receive (3A arm, n=61) or not to receive (0A arm, n=56) an additional 3 weekly doses of 6000 IU/m(2)/dose of Escherichia coli L-asparaginase during consolidation treatment on top of 2 doses (standard-risk patients) or 5 doses (high-risk patients). Events after remission included relapse (37.6%), death (16.2%), and abandonment of therapy (15.4%). There was no significant difference in relapses between the 2 arms. Patients in arm 3A versus 0A tended to have a lower 5 years disease-free survival (47.4+/-7.9% vs. 51.7+/-7.9%, P=0.72) and lower 5 years event-free survival (29.5+/-5.8% vs. 35.7+/-6.4%, P=0.61). We conclude that in our setting the use of 3 additional doses of L-asparaginase during consolidation therapy did not result in survival advantage. Contrariwise, adverse effects from this drug included higher treatment cost and systemic toxicity.","Widjajanto PH, Sumadiono S, Purwanto I, Sutaryo S, Veerman AJ",J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,2013 Nov,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
23733528,A medication diary-book for pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Event-free survival of pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Yogyakarta, Indonesia was low (20%). The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of using a medication diary-book on the treatment outcome of childhood ALL. PROCEDURE: A randomized study was conducted with 109 pediatric patients with ALL in a pediatric oncology center in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Both intervention and control groups received a structured parental education program and donated chemotherapy. The intervention group received a medication diary-book to remind parents and families to take oral chemotherapy and present for scheduled appointments or admissions. Event-free survival estimate (EFS) at 3 years was assessed. RESULTS: Among pediatric patients with ALL with highly educated mothers (senior high school or higher), the EFS-estimate at 3 years of the intervention group was significantly higher than the EFS-estimate at 3 years of the control group (62% vs. 29%, P = 0.04). Among pediatric patients with ALL with low-educated mothers, no significant difference was found in the EFS-estimates at 3 years between the intervention and control group (26% vs. 18%, P = 0.86). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that a medication diary-book might be useful to improve the survival of pediatric patients with ALL in resource-limited settings, particularly in patients with highly educated mothers.","Sitaresmi MN, Mostert S, Gundy CM, Ismail D, Veerman AJ",Pediatr Blood Cancer,2013 Oct,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
24797572,"Global, regional, and national levels of neonatal, infant, and under-5 mortality during 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013.","BACKGROUND: Remarkable financial and political efforts have been focused on the reduction of child mortality during the past few decades. Timely measurements of levels and trends in under-5 mortality are important to assess progress towards the Millennium Development Goal 4 (MDG 4) target of reduction of child mortality by two thirds from 1990 to 2015, and to identify models of success. METHODS: We generated updated estimates of child mortality in early neonatal (age 0-6 days), late neonatal (7-28 days), postneonatal (29-364 days), childhood (1-4 years), and under-5 (0-4 years) age groups for 188 countries from 1970 to 2013, with more than 29,000 survey, census, vital registration, and sample registration datapoints. We used Gaussian process regression with adjustments for bias and non-sampling error to synthesise the data for under-5 mortality for each country, and a separate model to estimate mortality for more detailed age groups. We used explanatory mixed effects regression models to assess the association between under-5 mortality and income per person, maternal education, HIV child death rates, secular shifts, and other factors. To quantify the contribution of these different factors and birth numbers to the change in numbers of deaths in under-5 age groups from 1990 to 2013, we used Shapley decomposition. We used estimated rates of change between 2000 and 2013 to construct under-5 mortality rate scenarios out to 2030. FINDINGS: We estimated that 6.3 million (95% UI 6.0-6.6) children under-5 died in 2013, a 64% reduction from 17.6 million (17.1-18.1) in 1970. In 2013, child mortality rates ranged from 152.5 per 1000 livebirths (130.6-177.4) in Guinea-Bissau to 2.3 (1.8-2.9) per 1000 in Singapore. The annualised rates of change from 1990 to 2013 ranged from -6.8% to 0.1%. 99 of 188 countries, including 43 of 48 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, had faster decreases in child mortality during 2000-13 than during 1990-2000. In 2013, neonatal deaths accounted for 41.6% of under-5 deaths compared with 37.4% in 1990. Compared with 1990, in 2013, rising numbers of births, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, led to 1.4 million more child deaths, and rising income per person and maternal education led to 0.9 million and 2.2 million fewer deaths, respectively. Changes in secular trends led to 4.2 million fewer deaths. Unexplained factors accounted for only -1% of the change in child deaths. In 30 developing countries, decreases since 2000 have been faster than predicted attributable to income, education, and secular shift alone. INTERPRETATION: Only 27 developing countries are expected to achieve MDG 4. Decreases since 2000 in under-5 mortality rates are accelerating in many developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The Millennium Declaration and increased development assistance for health might have been a factor in faster decreases in some developing countries. Without further accelerated progress, many countries in west and central Africa will still have high levels of under-5 mortality in 2030.

39667386,"Global, regional, and national progress towards the 2030 global nutrition targets and forecasts to 2050: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.","BACKGROUND: The six global nutrition targets (GNTs) related to low birthweight, exclusive breastfeeding, child growth (ie, wasting, stunting, and overweight), and anaemia among females of reproductive age were chosen by the World Health Assembly in 2012 as key indicators of maternal and child health, but there has yet to be a comprehensive report on progress for the period 2012 to 2021. We aimed to evaluate levels, trends, and observed-to-expected progress in prevalence and attributable burden from 2012 to 2021, with prevalence projections to 2050, in 204 countries and territories. METHODS: The prevalence and attributable burden of each target indicator were estimated by age group, sex, and year in 204 countries and territories from 2012 to 2021 in the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021, the most comprehensive assessment of causes of death, disability, and risk factors to date. Country-specific relative performance to date was evaluated with a Bayesian meta-regression model that compares prevalence to expected values based on Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator of societal development status. Target progress was forecasted from 2021 up to 2050 by modelling past trends with meta-regression using a combination of key quantities and then extrapolating future projections of those quantities. FINDINGS: In 2021, a few countries had already met some of the GNTs: five for exclusive breastfeeding, four for stunting, 96 for child wasting, and three for child overweight, and none met the target for low birthweight or anaemia in females of reproductive age. Since 2012, the annualised rates of change (ARC) in the prevalence of child overweight increased in 201 countries and territories and ARC in the prevalence of anaemia in females of reproductive age decreased considerably in 26 countries. Between 2012 and 2021, SDI was strongly associated with indicator prevalence, apart from exclusive breastfeeding (|r-|=0.46-0.86). Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa had a decrease in the prevalence of multiple indicators that was more rapid than expected on the basis of SDI (the differences between observed and expected ARCs for child stunting and wasting were -0.5% and -1.3%, respectively). The ARC in the attributable burden of low birthweight, child stunting, and child wasting decreased faster than the ARC of the prevalence for each in most low-income and middle-income countries. In 2030, we project that 94 countries will meet one of the six targets, 21 countries will meet two targets, and 89 countries will not meet any targets. We project that seven countries will meet the target for exclusive breastfeeding, 28 for child stunting, and 101 for child wasting, and no countries will meet the targets for low birthweight, child overweight, and anaemia. In 2050, we project that seven additional countries will meet the target for exclusive breastfeeding, five for low birthweight, 96 for child stunting, nine for child wasting, and one for child overweight, and no countries are projected to meet the anaemia target. INTERPRETATION: Based on current levels and past trends, few GNTs will be met by 2030. Major reductions in attributable burden for exclusive breastfeeding and anthropometric indicators should be recognised as huge scientific and policy successes, but the comparative lack of progress in reducing the prevalence of each, along with stagnant anaemia in women of reproductive age and widespread increases in child overweight, suggests a tenuous status quo. Continued investment in preventive and treatment efforts for acute childhood illness is crucial to prevent backsliding. Parallel development of effective treatments, along with commitment to multisectoral, long-term policies to address the determinants and causes of suboptimal nutrition, are sorely needed to gain ground.

18977652,Does aid reach the poor? Experiences of a childhood leukaemia outreach-programme.,"Previously, we found that the access to donated chemotherapy for childhood leukaemia patients in Indonesia was limited: only 16% of eligible families received donations. After the introduction of a structured parental education programme, we examined the access of parents of children with leukaemia to donated chemotherapy in an Indonesian academic hospital. The programme consisted of a video-presentation in hospital, information-booklet, audiocassette, DVD, procedures for informed-consent, statement of understanding for donated chemotherapy and a complaints-mechanism. Of 72 new patients, 51 parents (71%) were interviewed by independent psychologists using questionnaires. Parents of 21 patients (29%) did not participate because their children dropped-out (n=10) or died (n=11) before an interview took place. Four patients had health insurance and did not need donated chemotherapy. Access to donated chemotherapy was improved: 46/47 patients (98%) received donations. Structured parental education improved the access to donated chemotherapy. Outreach-programmes may benefit from this approach. This may enable more patients from poor socio-economic backgrounds in the developing countries to receive aid and achieve cure.","Mostert S, Sitaresmi MN, Gundy CM, Sutaryo, Veerman AJ",Eur J Cancer,2009 Feb,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia

36969097,The Minderoo-Monaco Commission on Plastics and Human Health.,"BACKGROUND: Plastics have conveyed great benefits to humanity and made possible some of the most significant advances of modern civilization in fields as diverse as medicine, electronics, aerospace, construction, food packaging, and sports. It is now clear, however, that plastics are also responsible for significant harms to human health, the economy, and the earth's environment. These harms occur at every stage of the plastic life cycle, from extraction of the coal, oil, and gas that are its main feedstocks through to ultimate disposal into the environment. The extent of these harms not been systematically assessed, their magnitude not fully quantified, and their economic costs not comprehensively counted. GOALS: The goals of this Minderoo-Monaco Commission on Plastics and Human Health are to comprehensively examine plastics' impacts across their life cycle on: (1) human health and well-being; (2) the global environment, especially the ocean; (3) the economy; and (4) vulnerable populations-the poor, minorities, and the world's children. On the basis of this examination, the Commission offers science-based recommendations designed to support development of a Global Plastics Treaty, protect human health, and save lives. REPORT STRUCTURE: This Commission report contains seven Sections. Following an Introduction, Section 2 presents a narrative review of the processes involved in plastic production, use, and disposal and notes the hazards to human health and the environment associated with each of these stages. Section 3 describes plastics' impacts on the ocean and notes the potential for plastic in the ocean to enter the marine food web and result in human exposure. Section 4 details plastics' impacts on human health. Section 5 presents a first-order estimate of plastics' health-related economic costs. Section 6 examines the intersection between plastic, social inequity, and environmental injustice. Section 7 presents the Commission's findings and recommendations. PLASTICS: Plastics are complex, highly heterogeneous, synthetic chemical materials. Over 98% of plastics are produced from fossil carbon- coal, oil and gas. Plastics are comprised of a carbon-based polymer backbone and thousands of additional chemicals that are incorporated into polymers to convey specific properties such as color, flexibility, stability, water repellence, flame retardation, and ultraviolet resistance. Many of these added chemicals are highly toxic. They include carcinogens, neurotoxicants and endocrine disruptors such as phthalates, bisphenols, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), brominated flame retardants, and organophosphate flame retardants. They are integral components of plastic and are responsible for many of plastics' harms to human health and the environment.Global plastic production has increased almost exponentially since World War II, and in this time more than 8,300 megatons (Mt) of plastic have been manufactured. Annual production volume has grown from under 2 Mt in 1950 to 460 Mt in 2019, a 230-fold increase, and is on track to triple by 2060. More than half of all plastic ever made has been produced since 2002. Single-use plastics account for 35-40% of current plastic production and represent the most rapidly growing segment of plastic manufacture.Explosive recent growth in plastics production reflects a deliberate pivot by the integrated multinational fossil-carbon corporations that produce coal, oil and gas and that also manufacture plastics. These corporations are reducing their production of fossil fuels and increasing plastics manufacture. The two principal factors responsible for this pivot are decreasing global demand for carbon-based fuels due to increases in 'green' energy, and massive expansion of oil and gas production due to fracking.Plastic manufacture is energy-intensive and contributes significantly to climate change. At present, plastic production is responsible for an estimated 3.7% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the contribution of Brazil. This fraction is projected to increase to 4.5% by 2060 if current trends continue unchecked. PLASTIC LIFE CYCLE: The plastic life cycle has three phases: production, use, and disposal. In production, carbon feedstocks-coal, gas, and oil-are transformed through energy-intensive, catalytic processes into a vast array of products. Plastic use occurs in every aspect of modern life and results in widespread human exposure to the chemicals contained in plastic. Single-use plastics constitute the largest portion of current use, followed by synthetic fibers and construction.Plastic disposal is highly inefficient, with recovery and recycling rates below 10% globally. The result is that an estimated 22 Mt of plastic waste enters the environment each year, much of it single-use plastic and are added to the more than 6 gigatons of plastic waste that have accumulated since 1950. Strategies for disposal of plastic waste include controlled and uncontrolled landfilling, open burning, thermal conversion, and export. Vast quantities of plastic waste are exported each year from high-income to low-income countries, where it accumulates in landfills, pollutes air and water, degrades vital ecosystems, befouls beaches and estuaries, and harms human health-environmental injustice on a global scale. Plastic-laden e-waste is particularly problematic. ENVIRONMENTAL FINDINGS: Plastics and plastic-associated chemicals are responsible for widespread pollution. They contaminate aquatic (marine and freshwater), terrestrial, and atmospheric environments globally. The ocean is the ultimate destination for much plastic, and plastics are found throughout the ocean, including coastal regions, the sea surface, the deep sea, and polar sea ice. Many plastics appear to resist breakdown in the ocean and could persist in the global environment for decades. Macro- and micro-plastic particles have been identified in hundreds of marine species in all major taxa, including species consumed by humans. Trophic transfer of microplastic particles and the chemicals within them has been demonstrated. Although microplastic particles themselves (>10 microm) appear not to undergo biomagnification, hydrophobic plastic-associated chemicals bioaccumulate in marine animals and biomagnify in marine food webs. The amounts and fates of smaller microplastic and nanoplastic particles (MNPs <10 microm) in aquatic environments are poorly understood, but the potential for harm is worrying given their mobility in biological systems. Adverse environmental impacts of plastic pollution occur at multiple levels from molecular and biochemical to population and ecosystem. MNP contamination of seafood results in direct, though not well quantified, human exposure to plastics and plastic-associated chemicals. Marine plastic pollution endangers the ocean ecosystems upon which all humanity depends for food, oxygen, livelihood, and well-being. HUMAN HEALTH FINDINGS: Coal miners, oil workers and gas field workers who extract fossil carbon feedstocks for plastic production suffer increased mortality from traumatic injury, coal workers' pneumoconiosis, silicosis, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. Plastic production workers are at increased risk of leukemia, lymphoma, hepatic angiosarcoma, brain cancer, breast cancer, mesothelioma, neurotoxic injury, and decreased fertility. Workers producing plastic textiles die of bladder cancer, lung cancer, mesothelioma, and interstitial lung disease at increased rates. Plastic recycling workers have increased rates of cardiovascular disease, toxic metal poisoning, neuropathy, and lung cancer. Residents of ""fenceline"" communities adjacent to plastic production and waste disposal sites experience increased risks of premature birth, low birth weight, asthma, childhood leukemia, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer.During use and also in disposal, plastics release toxic chemicals including additives and residual monomers into the environment and into people. National biomonitoring surveys in the USA document population-wide exposures to these chemicals. Plastic additives disrupt endocrine function and increase risk for premature births, neurodevelopmental disorders, male reproductive birth defects, infertility, obesity, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, and cancers. Chemical-laden MNPs formed through the environmental degradation of plastic waste can enter living organisms, including humans. Emerging, albeit still incomplete evidence indicates that MNPs may cause toxicity due to their physical and toxicological effects as well as by acting as vectors that transport toxic chemicals and bacterial pathogens into tissues and cells.Infants in the womb and young children are two populations at particularly high risk of plastic-related health effects. Because of the exquisite sensitivity of early development to hazardous chemicals and children's unique patterns of exposure, plastic-associated exposures are linked to increased risks of prematurity, stillbirth, low birth weight, birth defects of the reproductive organs, neurodevelopmental impairment, impaired lung growth, and childhood cancer. Early-life exposures to plastic-associated chemicals also increase the risk of multiple non-communicable diseases later in life. ECONOMIC FINDINGS: Plastic's harms to human health result in significant economic costs. We estimate that in 2015 the health-related costs of plastic production exceeded $250 billion (2015 Int$) globally, and that in the USA alone the health costs of disease and disability caused by the plastic-associated chemicals PBDE, BPA and DEHP exceeded $920 billion (2015 Int$). Plastic production results in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions equivalent to 1.96 gigatons of carbon dioxide (CO(2)e) annually. Using the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) social cost of carbon metric, we estimate the annual costs of these GHG emissions to be $341 billion (2015 Int$).These costs, large as they are, almost certainly underestimate the full economic losses resulting from plastics' negative impacts on human health and the global environment. All of plastics' economic costs-and also its social costs-are externalized by the petrochemical and plastic manufacturing industry and are borne by citizens, taxpayers, and governments in countries around the world without compensation. SOCIAL JUSTICE FINDINGS: The adverse effects of plastics and plastic pollution on human health, the economy and the environment are not evenly distributed. They disproportionately affect poor, disempowered, and marginalized populations such as workers, racial and ethnic minorities, ""fenceline"" communities, Indigenous groups, women, and children, all of whom had little to do with creating the current plastics crisis and lack the political influence or the resources to address it. Plastics' harmful impacts across its life cycle are most keenly felt in the Global South, in small island states, and in disenfranchised areas in the Global North. Social and environmental justice (SEJ) principles require reversal of these inequitable burdens to ensure that no group bears a disproportionate share of plastics' negative impacts and that those who benefit economically from plastic bear their fair share of its currently externalized costs. CONCLUSIONS: It is now clear that current patterns of plastic production, use, and disposal are not sustainable and are responsible for significant harms to human health, the environment, and the economy as well as for deep societal injustices.The main driver of these worsening harms is an almost exponential and still accelerating increase in global plastic production. Plastics' harms are further magnified by low rates of recovery and recycling and by the long persistence of plastic waste in the environment.The thousands of chemicals in plastics-monomers, additives, processing agents, and non-intentionally added substances-include amongst their number known human carcinogens, endocrine disruptors, neurotoxicants, and persistent organic pollutants. These chemicals are responsible for many of plastics' known harms to human and planetary health. The chemicals leach out of plastics, enter the environment, cause pollution, and result in human exposure and disease. All efforts to reduce plastics' hazards must address the hazards of plastic-associated chemicals. RECOMMENDATIONS: To protect human and planetary health, especially the health of vulnerable and at-risk populations, and put the world on track to end plastic pollution by 2040, this Commission supports urgent adoption by the world's nations of a strong and comprehensive Global Plastics Treaty in accord with the mandate set forth in the March 2022 resolution of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA).International measures such as a Global Plastics Treaty are needed to curb plastic production and pollution, because the harms to human health and the environment caused by plastics, plastic-associated chemicals and plastic waste transcend national boundaries, are planetary in their scale, and have disproportionate impacts on the health and well-being of people in the world's poorest nations. Effective implementation of the Global Plastics Treaty will require that international action be coordinated and complemented by interventions at the national, regional, and local levels.This Commission urges that a cap on global plastic production with targets, timetables, and national contributions be a central provision of the Global Plastics Treaty. We recommend inclusion of the following additional provisions:The Treaty needs to extend beyond microplastics and marine litter to include all of the many thousands of chemicals incorporated into plastics.The Treaty needs to include a provision banning or severely restricting manufacture and use of unnecessary, avoidable, and problematic plastic items, especially single-use items such as manufactured plastic microbeads.The Treaty needs to include requirements on extended producer responsibility (EPR) that make fossil carbon producers, plastic producers, and the manufacturers of plastic products legally and financially responsible for the safety and end-of-life management of all the materials they produce and sell.The Treaty needs to mandate reductions in the chemical complexity of plastic products; health-protective standards for plastics and plastic additives; a requirement for use of sustainable non-toxic materials; full disclosure of all components; and traceability of components. International cooperation will be essential to implementing and enforcing these standards.The Treaty needs to include SEJ remedies at each stage of the plastic life cycle designed to fill gaps in community knowledge and advance both distributional and procedural equity.This Commission encourages inclusion in the Global Plastic Treaty of a provision calling for exploration of listing at least some plastic polymers as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) under the Stockholm Convention.This Commission encourages a strong interface between the Global Plastics Treaty and the Basel and London Conventions to enhance management of hazardous plastic waste and slow current massive exports of plastic waste into the world's least-developed countries.This Commission recommends the creation of a Permanent Science Policy Advisory Body to guide the Treaty's implementation. The main priorities of this Body would be to guide Member States and other stakeholders in evaluating which solutions are most effective in reducing plastic consumption, enhancing plastic waste recovery and recycling, and curbing the generation of plastic waste. This Body could also assess trade-offs among these solutions and evaluate safer alternatives to current plastics. It could monitor the transnational export of plastic waste. It could coordinate robust oceanic-, land-, and air-based MNP monitoring programs.This Commission recommends urgent investment by national governments in research into solutions to the global plastic crisis. This research will need to determine which solutions are most effective and cost-effective in the context of particular countries and assess the risks and benefits of proposed solutions. Oceanographic and environmental research is needed to better measure concentrations and impacts of plastics <10 microm and understand their distribution and fate in the global environment. Biomedical research is needed to elucidate the human health impacts of plastics, especially MNPs. SUMMARY: This Commission finds that plastics are both a boon to humanity and a stealth threat to human and planetary health. Plastics convey enormous benefits, but current linear patterns of plastic production, use, and disposal that pay little attention to sustainable design or safe materials and a near absence of recovery, reuse, and recycling are responsible for grave harms to health, widespread environmental damage, great economic costs, and deep societal injustices. These harms are rapidly worsening.While there remain gaps in knowledge about plastics' harms and uncertainties about their full magnitude, the evidence available today demonstrates unequivocally that these impacts are great and that they will increase in severity in the absence of urgent and effective intervention at global scale. Manufacture and use of essential plastics may continue. However, reckless increases in plastic production, and especially increases in the manufacture of an ever-increasing array of unnecessary single-use plastic products, need to be curbed.Global intervention against the plastic crisis is needed now because the costs of failure to act will be immense.","Landrigan PJ, Raps H, Cropper M, Bald C, Brunner M, Canonizado EM, Charles D, Chiles TC, Donohue MJ, Enck J, Fenichel P, Fleming LE, Ferrier-Pages C, Fordham R, Gozt A, Griffin C, Hahn ME, Haryanto B, Hixson R, Ianelli H, James BD, Kumar P, Laborde A, Law KL, Martin K, Mu J, Mulders Y, Mustapha A, Niu J, Pahl S, Park Y, Pedrotti ML, Pitt JA, Ruchirawat M, Seewoo BJ, Spring M, Stegeman JJ, Suk W, Symeonides C, Takada H, Thompson RC, Vicini A, Wang Z, Whitman E, Wirth D, Wolff M, Yousuf AK, Dunlop S",Ann Glob Health,2023,Childhood Cancer AND Indonesia
38647059,Praziquantel as the preferred treatment for schistosomiasis.,"Schistosomiasis, caused by Schistosoma trematode worms, represents a significant global health challenge. This review offers a thorough examination of the disease's epidemiology, transmission dynamics, diagnostic modalities, and treatment options. Diagnostic techniques encompass direct parasitological methods, immunological assays, DNA/RNA detection, and biomarker utilization, each with distinct advantages and limitations. There is an urgent need for improved diagnostic tools with enhanced sensitivity and specificity. Praziquantel remains the cornerstone of treatment, exhibiting efficacy against all Schistosoma species, while the potential of artemisin derivatives in combination therapy is also explored. In this review, we focus on the importance of praziquantel administration as the central aspect of schistosomiasis treatment, highlighting ongoing efforts to optimize its utilization for improved patient outcomes.","Condeng YH, Katu S, Aman AM, Rasyid H, Bakri S, Iskandar H",Int Marit Health,2024,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
35594896,Review of 2022 WHO guidelines on the control and elimination of schistosomiasis.,"Schistosomiasis is a helminthiasis infecting approximately 250 million people worldwide. In 2001, the World Health Assembly (WHA) 54.19 resolution defined a new global strategy for control of schistosomiasis through preventive chemotherapy programmes. This resolution culminated in the 2006 WHO guidelines that recommended empirical treatment by mass drug administration with praziquantel, predominately to school-aged children in endemic settings at regular intervals. Since then, school-based and community-based preventive chemotherapy programmes have been scaled-up, reducing schistosomiasis-associated morbidity. Over the past 15 years, new scientific evidence-combined with a more ambitious goal of eliminating schistosomiasis and an increase in the global donated supply of praziquantel-has highlighted the need to update public health guidance worldwide. In February, 2022, WHO published new guidelines with six recommendations to update the global public health strategy against schistosomiasis, including expansion of preventive chemotherapy eligibility from the predominant group of school-aged children to all age groups (2 years and older), lowering the prevalence threshold for annual preventive chemotherapy, and increasing the frequency of treatment. This Review, written by the 2018-2022 Schistosomiasis Guidelines Development Group and its international partners, presents a summary of the new WHO guideline recommendations for schistosomiasis along with their historical context, supporting evidence, implications for public health implementation, and future research needs.","Lo NC, Bezerra FSM, Colley DG, Fleming FM, Homeida M, Kabatereine N, Kabole FM, King CH, Mafe MA, Midzi N, Mutapi F, Mwanga JR, Ramzy RMR, Satrija F, Stothard JR, Traore MS, Webster JP, Utzinger J, Zhou XN, Danso-Appiah A, Eusebi P, Loker ES, Obonyo CO, Quansah R, Liang S, Vaillant M, Murad MH, Hagan P, Garba A",Lancet Infect Dis,2022 Nov,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
25881045,"The present situation and towards the prevention and control of neurocysticercosis on the tropical island, Bali, Indonesia.","Neurocysticercosis (NCC), which is caused by accidental ingestion of eggs of the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium, was common in Bali, Indonesia until the early 1990s. However, improved education on hygiene and sanitation, a move to keeping pigs indoors, and improvement of economic and living conditions have substantially reduced the occurrence of NCC in Bali. Since 2011, T. solium tapeworm carriers (T. solium taeniasis) and heavily infected pigs and dogs have exclusively been detected from villages in mountainous regions of northeastern Bali where NCC and ocular cysticercosis (OCC) cases have also been identified. In response to this continued area of high infection, a one-day workshop was convened to discuss how to prevent and control this potentially lethal zoonotic parasitic infection in Bali. This review presents an overview of the current status of T. solium taeniasis and cysticercosis in Indonesia and proposes a strategy for the prevention and control of this zoonosis in Bali.","Wandra T, Swastika K, Dharmawan NS, Purba IE, Sudarmaja IM, Yoshida T, Sako Y, Okamoto M, Eka Diarthini NL, Sri Laksemi DA, Yanagida T, Nakao M, Ito A",Parasit Vectors,2015 Mar 7,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
31391023,"Prevalence and risk factors of soil-transmitted helminthiasis among school children living in an agricultural area of North Sumatera, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: Soil-transmitted helminth infection (STH) is one of the neglected tropical disease that affects approximately 2 billion people globally. School children represent the age group that is most commonly infected with STHs, resulting in poor school performance, impaired cognitive function, and many other detrimental effects. The transmission of STH is determined by many factors, such as hygiene and sanitation. Understanding the factors that influence disease transmission in a particular area is key to effective STH control. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of STH in North Sumatera and to identify the associated risk factors among school children. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out among primary school children in Suka village, Tigapanah subdistrict. Stool samples were processed using a single Kato-Katz method. The potential risk factors analyzed were parent education and occupation, hand washing habits, latrine usage, footwear usage and contact with soil. The Chi-square test was performed to identify an association between risk factors and parasitological results. Logistic regression analysis was used to measure the strength of association. RESULTS: We enrolled 468 school children between 6 and 12 years of age. Among those children, 268 children (57.24%) were positive for one or more STH infections. Approximately 62.39% of children played with soil/dirt every day, and only 50% regularly washed their hands after activities. Most of the children wore shoes/slippers when going outside (87.82%) and used a latrine for defecation (85.04%). Playing with soil/dirt have been shown to increase the risk of STH infections 7.53 times, while hand washing habits and latrine usage decreased the risk of STH infections 0.16 times each. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of STH infection in school children in Suka village, Tigapanah subdistrict is still high. Playing with soil/dirt increased the risk of infection, while hand washing habits and latrine usage decreased the risk of infection. The combined strategies of improving the personal hygiene of children and biannual deworming can reduce the risk of STH infection in school children in Suka village, Tigapanah subdistrict.","Pasaribu AP, Alam A, Sembiring K, Pasaribu S, Setiabudi D",BMC Public Health,2019 Aug 7,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
16376140,"Taeniasis and cysticercosis in Bali and North Sumatra, Indonesia.","It has been reported that three human Taenia species are distributed in Indonesia: Taenia solium, Taenia asiatica and Taenia saginata. T. asiatica is well known in North Sumatra, especially on Samosir island in Lake Toba. T. solium and T. saginata are known from Bali. T. solium is most serious public health issue in Papua (former Irian Jaya). In this report, we briefly review the present situation of these three human Taenia species mainly in Bali and North Sumatra. For community based epidemiological survey, we have adopted and applied questionnaire, microscopic observation of eggs, coproantigen tests, coproDNA tests, mitochondrial DNA analysis and morphology for isolated specimens, serology for cysticercosis and taeniasis. For detection of taeniasis cases of both T. saginata and T. asiatica, questionnaire by expert doctors is perfect to detect worm carriers. Corpoantigen test developed for detection of taeniasis of T. solium is also highly reliable to detect taeniasis carriers in the community. Epidemiological data from these two islands 2002-2005 are reviewed with backgrounds of historical culture, religions and customs.","Wandra T, Depary AA, Sutisna P, Margono SS, Suroso T, Okamoto M, Craig PS, Ito A",Parasitol Int,2006,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
23965293,Taeniases and cysticercosis in Indonesia: past and present situations.,"The main aim of this study is to overview the past and present situations of human taeniases and cysticercosis in Indonesia and including future perspectives. Through joint projects from 1996, we have confirmed the occurrence of Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm) in Bali, of Taenia solium (pork tapeworm) mainly in Papua and sporadically in Bali, and of Taenia asiatica in North Sumatra. These taeniases were caused through eating uncooked pork and pig viscera for T. solium and T. asiatica, respectively, and beef for T. saginata. The distribution of these tapeworms in Indonesia is basically highly restricted by the traditional cultural and religious backgrounds in each island. T. saginata is relatively common in Bali although people consume pork 'lawar' more than beef 'lawar'. Taeniases due to T. saginata or T. asiatica and T. solium and cysticercosis due to T. solium have also been sporadically reported in some other islands. Among these species, T. solium is exceptional since humans can be infected not only by larval stages (cysticerci) in pork but also by eggs released from human tapeworm carriers. Cysticercosis has been confirmed in Indonesia in humans, pigs and even dogs.","Wandra T, Ito A, Swastika K, Dharmawan NS, Sako Y, Okamoto M",Parasitology,2013 Nov,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
9432400,Tropical pulmonary diseases.,"The term 'tropical' refers to the region of the Earth lying between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. Located between these equatorial parallels demarcating the Torrid Zone are several underdeveloped and developing countries: Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, southern India, Sri Lanka, Brazil, Cuba, Ethiopia, Sudan and Nigeria, to name but a few considered to be 'tropical'. The climate in most of these countries is characterized by high temperatures and high humidity. The tropical climate and general state of socio-economic underdevelopment in such countries provide an ideal environment for pathogenic organisms, their vectors and intermediate hosts to flourish. Furthermore, the cultural habits and educational background of the people living in such countries expose them to pathogens and, when these people become infected, they readily become reservoirs for, or carriers of, those organisms. Ultimately, the adverse socioeconomic conditions of underdeveloped countries impede attempts to eradicate or control tropical diseases.",Bovornkitti S,Respirology,1996 Mar,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
37233816,A critical review of anisakidosis cases occurring globally.,"A review was conducted to identify the most common causative agents of anisakidosis, the methods used for identification of the causative agents, and to summarize the sources of infection, and patients' demographics. A total of 762 cases (409 articles, inclusive of all languages) were found between 1965 and 2022. The age range was 7 months to 85 years old. Out of the 34 countries, Japan, Spain, and South Korea stood out with the highest number of published human cases of anisakidosis, respectively. This raises the question: Why are there few to no reports of anisakidosis cases in other countries, such as Indonesia and Vietnam, where seafood consumption is notably high? Other than the gastrointestinal tract, parasites were frequently found in internal organs such as liver, spleen, pancreas, lung, hiatal and epigastric hernia, and tonsils. There are also reports of the worm being excreted through the nose, rectum, and mouth. Symptoms included sore throat, tumor, bleeding, gastric/epigastric/abdominal/substernal/lower back/testicular pain, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, intestinal obstruction, intussusception, blood in feces, hematochezia, anemia, and respiratory arrest. These appeared either immediately or up to 2 months after consuming raw/undercooked seafood and lasting up to 10 years. Anisakidosis commonly mimicked symptoms of cancer, pancreatitis, type I/II Kounis syndrome, intussusception, Crohn's disease, ovarian cysts, intestinal endometriosis, epigastralgia, gastritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hernia, intestinal obstruction, peritonitis, and appendicitis. In these cases, it was only after surgery that it was found these symptoms/conditions were caused by anisakids. A range of not only mainly marine but also freshwater fish/shellfish were reported as source of infection. There were several reports of infection with >1 nematode (up to >200), more than one species of anisakids in the same patient, and the presence of L4/adult nematodes. The severity of symptoms did not relate to the number of parasites. The number of anisakidosis cases is grossly underestimated globally. Using erroneous taxonomic terms, assumptions, and identifying the parasite as Anisakis (based solely on the Y-shaped lateral cord in crossed section of the parasite) are still common. The Y-shaped lateral cord is not unique to Anisakis spp. Acquiring a history of ingesting raw/undercooked fish/seafood can be a clue to the diagnosis of the condition. This review emphasizes the following key points: insufficient awareness of fish parasites among medical professionals, seafood handlers, and policy makers; limited availability of effective diagnostic methodologies; and inadequate clinical information for optimizing the management of anisakidosis in numerous regions worldwide.","Shamsi S, Barton DP",Parasitol Res,2023 Aug,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia

We conducted a systematic literature review based on Google Scholar and Pubmed for non-nutritional anemia. We supplemented this with hemoglobin and chronic disease data in Makassar where prevalence and type of anemia were available. To effectively reduce anemia prevalence in Indonesia, interventions should address both nutritional and non-nutritional contributing factors, in-cluding infection and genetic predisposition.","Bukhari A, Hamid F, Minhajat R, Sutisna NS, Marsella CP",Asia Pac J Clin Nutr,2020,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
31533400,Current Status of Parasite Infections in Indonesia: A Literature Review.,"Indonesia and South Korea have become inseparable in various respects since the 2 countries established diplomatic relation in 1973. Indonesia is a tropical region that stretches across the equator, comprised of 5 main islands (Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra, Sulawesi, and Papua) and 4 archipelagoes (Riau, Bangka Belitung, Nusa Tenggara, and Maluku). As most population of Eastern Indonesia (Sulawesi, Papua and Nusa Tenggara &amp; Maluku) live in poor areas, it is expected that there will be many parasites. Nevertheless, little is known about the status of parasites in Indonesia. This study examines the prevalences of malaria and lymphatic filaria, which are prevalent in Indonesia, as well as those of soil-transmitted-helminths (STH). As a result, the Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax case loads are almost equal. The current prevalence of P. vivax is uniformly low (&lt;5%) in all age groups and annual parasite incidence (API) showed decreasing tendency as 0.84 per 1,000 population in 2016. However, more than 65 million people still live in malaria epidemic regions. Lymphatic filariasis remains an important public health problem and 236 cities were classified as endemic areas in 514 cities/districts in 2017. It is difficult to ascertain the current prevalence rate of STH in Indonesia, although West Sumba and Southwest Sumba in East Nusa Tenggara reported prevalence rate of more than 20%. The study also considers the (sero) prevalences of other parasites identified in Indonesia. This report should be useful not only to parasitologists but also to travelers and people with business in Indonesia.","Lee J, Ryu JS",Korean J Parasitol,2019 Aug,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
38338980,Transmission-Blocking Vaccines against Schistosomiasis Japonica.,"Control of schistosomiasis japonica, endemic in Asia, including the Philippines, China, and Indonesia, is extremely challenging. Schistosoma japonicum is a highly pathogenic helminth parasite, with disease arising predominantly from an immune reaction to entrapped parasite eggs in tissues. Females of this species can generate 1000-2200 eggs per day, which is about 3- to 15-fold greater than the egg output of other schistosome species. Bovines (water buffalo and cattle) are the predominant definitive hosts and are estimated to generate up to 90% of parasite eggs released into the environment in rural endemic areas where these hosts and humans are present. Here, we highlight the necessity of developing veterinary transmission-blocking vaccines for bovines to better control the disease and review potential vaccine candidates. We also point out that the approach to producing efficacious transmission-blocking animal-based vaccines before moving on to human vaccines is crucial. This will result in effective and feasible public health outcomes in agreement with the One Health concept to achieve optimum health for people, animals, and the environment. Indeed, incorporating a veterinary-based transmission vaccine, coupled with interventions such as human mass drug administration, improved sanitation and hygiene, health education, and snail control, would be invaluable to eliminating zoonotic schistosomiasis.","Zumuk CP, Jones MK, Navarro S, Gray DJ, You H",Int J Mol Sci,2024 Jan 30,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
6812197,Ascariasis: host-pathogen biology.,"Ascaris lumbricoides is one of the most common intestinal parasites in humans. Daily global contamination of the soil by A. lumbricoides eggs is enormous (approximately 9 x 10(14) eggs/day). Physical factors, particularly temperature and moisture, are critical in determining the maturation of eggs to the infective stage and their survival. Transmission of the infection to humans, on the other hand, depends more on various socioeconomic factors. In theory, ascariasis is preventable; it is indeed on the way to disappearing completely in developed societies where there is a high standard of sanitation. Ascariasis remains a problem in developing countries, however, where methods of disposal of human excreta are inadequate. The intensity of invasion is regulated by specific and nonspecific responses of the host to migrating A. lumbricoides larvae. Whether or not ascariasis becomes symptomatic depends on the intensity of the infection, the nutritional and immunologic status of the host, and the possible complications that may arise. Host responses to A. lumbricoides are brisk during the larval migratory stage in which hypersensitivity reactions may become clinically manifest, whereas people are rather tolerant of intestinal infections with adult worms. The role of ascariasis in the prevalence of allergic asthma still remains unclear. Complications due to migration of adult worms into the biliary duct system and to intestinal obstructions are the major causes of acute morbidity and mortality in ascariasis.",Pawlowski ZS,Rev Infect Dis,1982 Jul-Aug,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia

Prevalence of Ascaris, Trichuris and hookworm was 92%, 98%, and 1.4%, respectively. 91% children had both Ascaris and Trichuris infections. About half of the Ascaris- and Trichuris-infected children (46% and 58%, respectively) had moderate infections. Stunting was seen in 55% of the children, while wasting was observed in 10%. Boys had lower nutritional status than girls (p < 0.001), based on weight-for-age (WA) and height-for-age (HA) Z-scores. Age had an inverse relationship with WA and HA Z-scores (p < 0.0004). A relationship between helminth infections and nutritional status was observed between log Trichuris egg count and WA and HA Z-scores after controlling for age, sex, and log Ascaris egg count (p = 0.048 for HA Z-score, and p = 0.058 for WA Z-score). The relationship was also found when Trichuris infection was categorized into mild, moderate, and severe infections (p = 0.017 and p = 0.001 for HA and WA Z-scores, respectively). Scheffe's test for multiple mean comparisons showed that Trichuris-infected children with above 1,000 eggs per gram feces had significantly lower nutritional status than lower epg or non-infected children (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05 for HA and WA Z-scores respectively).","Hadju V, Abadi K, Stephenson LS, Noor NN, Mohammed HO, Bowman DD",Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health,1995 Dec,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia

METHODS: Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched for articles published between 1 January 1992 and 31 December 2022, reporting LF, STH and SC in Indonesia. Using the Ministry of Health lists of districts receiving PC programs, we identified whether data collection was conducted before or after PC implementation in that particular district. A meta-analysis was performed with a random-effects model applied to pool pre- and post-PC prevalence of LF, STH and SC. RESULTS: Overall, 195 studies were included. The pooled prevalence of LF was 9.72% (95% CI, 5.56%-13.87%). The pre-PC pooled prevalence of LF was 11.48% (95% CI, 5.52%-17.45%). The prevalence decreased after PC implementation, and the pooled prevalence was 7.12% (95% CI, 1.79%-12.44%). The overall prevalence of STH was 35.16% (95% CI, 30.36%-39.96%). The pre-PC prevalence of STH was 36.29% (95% CI, 30.37%-42.20%). The post-PC prevalence of STH decreased at 31.93% (95% CI, 24.25%-39.62%), although the difference between before and after PC was not significant (p = 0.379). Only nine studies investigated the prevalence of SC; based on the random-effects model, the pooled prevalence was 21.90% (95% CI, 4.88%-38.92%). Owing to the scarcity of studies, we could not perform the funnel tests for publication bias and moderating variables of the pooled prevalence for SC. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of LF and STH decreased after PC implementation, although it was not significant. The difference for SC could not be assessed because of limited post-PC data. The uneven distribution of research and the lack of standardised sampling methods may not fully capture the situation.","Murhandarwati EH, Probandari A, Kusumasari RA, Ferdiana A, Kustanti CY, Dewi K, Tarmizi SN, Wulandari LPL, Schierhout G, Romani L, Kaldor J, Nery SV",Trop Med Int Health,2024 Dec,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
34968452,"Implementation of Taenia solium control measures in Bali, Indonesia: Survey findings and a historical overview.","Historically, cysticercosis cases caused by infection with the larval stage of the Taenia solium tapeworm have occurred sporadically in Bali, with taeniasis carriers found primarily in villages located in the Kubu subdistrict of Karangasem. As Bali is a well-known tourist destination, living standards are relatively high on the island, except for an area located beneath the northeast slope of the active volcano Mt. Agung (Alt. 3031 m), which includes Kubu. Over the last 30 years, pigs originating from this area have been found with T. solium cysticerci, whereas pigs from other parts of the island have not been shown to be infected. Out of 108 individuals screened via fecal sample examination in Kubu during 2019, 3 cases of T. solium taeniasis (2.8%) were identified. There was no significant difference in taeniasis prevalence from surveys conducted in 2011-2016 (1.0%, 11/1089) (p = 0.123). Out of 110 humans and 140 pigs tested serologically in Kubu during 2019, no cases of cysticercosis were identified. This is in contrast to a seroprevalence of 4.1% (42/1025) in humans during 2011-2016 and a seroprevalence of 13.1% (43/329) in pigs during 2011-2013. Over the last decade, improved drinking water and sanitary systems have been employed in addition to health education targeting primary school children, including emphasis on washing hands before eating and after defecation. This review provides previously unpublished survey data and a historical overview of T. solium infection in Bali and offers guidance on best practices to ensure that remaining pockets of transmission are addressed.","Ito A, Yoshida T, Wandra T, Sudewi AAR, Susilawathi NM, Swastika K, Purba IE, Li T, Budke CM",Acta Trop,2022 Mar,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia

We analysed parasitic infections and gut microbiota composition in 325 children attending high- and low-SES schools in Makassar, Indonesia before and after albendazole treatment. Lactulose/Mannitol Ratio (LMR, a marker of gut permeability); I-FABP (a surrogate marker of intestinal damage) as well as inflammatory markers (LBP) were measured. Helminth infections were highly prevalent (65.6%) in low-SES children. LMR and I-FABP levels were higher in low-SES children (geomean (95%CI): 4.03 (3.67-4.42) vs. 3.22 (2.91-3.57); p. adj < 0.001; and 1.57 (1.42-1.74) vs. 1.25 (1.13-1.38); p. adj = 0.02, respectively) while LBP levels were lower compared to the high-SES (19.39 (17.09-22.01) vs. 22.74 (20.07-26.12); p.adj = 0.01). Albendazole reduced helminth infections in low-SES and also decreased LMR with 11% reduction but only in helminth-uninfected children (estimated treatment effect: 0.89; p.adj = 0.01). Following treatment, I-FABP decreased in high- (0.91, p.adj < 0.001) but increased (1.12, p.adj = 0.004) in low-SES children. Albendazole did not alter the levels of LBP.

36697451,Model validation for a knowledge and practices survey towards prevention of soil-transmitted helminth infections in rural villages in Indonesia.,"The rate of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infection is estimated to be around 20% in Indonesia. Health promotion and health education are cost-effective strategies to supplement STH prevention and control programs. Existing studies suggest that quantitative tools for knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) are important to monitor effective community-based STH interventions. However, evidence is limited regarding the applicability of such tools. This study aims to identify the socio-demographic predictors for STH-related knowledge and practices and validate the quantitative tools in population use. A cross-sectional study design was conducted among residents of 16 villages in Central Java, Indonesia. Adult and child respondents were interviewed to assess general knowledge and practices in relation to STH. Two mixed effects models identified the significant factors in predicting knowledge and practice scores. The model predicted knowledge and practice scores were compared with the observed scores to validate the quantitative measurements developed in this study. Participants' socio-demographic variables were significant in predicting an individual's STH-related knowledge level and their hand washing and hygiene practices, taking into account household-level variability. Model validation results confirmed that the quantitative measurement tools were suitable for assessing STH associated knowledge and behaviour. The questionnaire developed in this study can be used to support school- and community-based health education interventions to maximize the effect of STH prevention and control programs.","Lee P, Kurscheid JM, Laksono B, Park MJ, Clements ACA, Lowe C, Stewart DE, Gray DJ",Sci Rep,2023 Jan 25,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
28381246,"'Fit for school' - a school-based water, sanitation and hygiene programme to improve child health: Results from a longitudinal study in Cambodia, Indonesia and Lao PDR.","BACKGROUND: The Fit for School (FIT) programme integrates school health and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene interventions, which are implemented by the Ministries of Education in four Southeast Asian countries. This paper describes the findings of a Health Outcome Study, which aimed to assess the two-year effect of the FIT programme on the parasitological, weight, and oral health status of children attending schools implementing the programme in Cambodia, Indonesia and Lao PDR. METHODS: The study was a non-randomized clustered controlled trial with a follow-up period of two years. The intervention group consisted of children attending public elementary schools implementing the FIT programme, including daily group handwashing with soap and toothbrushing with fluoride toothpaste, biannual school-based deworming; as well as construction of group handwashing facilities. Control schools implemented the regular government health education curriculum and biannual deworming. Per school, a random selection of six to seven-year-old grade-one students was drawn. Data on parasitological infections, anthropometric measurements, dental caries, odontogenic infections and sociodemographic characteristics were collected at baseline and at follow-up (24 months later). Data were analysed using the chi(2)-test, Mann Whitney U-test and multilevel logistic and linear regression. RESULTS: A total of 1847 children (mean age = 6.7 years, range 6.0-8.0 years) participated in the baseline survey. Of these, 1499 children were available for follow-up examination - 478, 486 and 535 children in Cambodia, Indonesia and Lao PDR, respectively. In all three countries, children in intervention schools had a lower increment in the number of decayed, missing and filled permanent teeth between baseline and follow-up, in comparison to children in controls schools. The preventive fraction was 24% at average. The prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth infection (which was unexpectedly low at baseline), the prevalence of thinness and the prevalence of odontogenic infections did not significantly differ between baseline and follow-up, nor between intervention and control schools. CONCLUSIONS: The study found that the FIT programme significantly contributed to the prevention of dental caries in children. This study describes the challenges, learnings and, moreover, the importance of conducting real-life implementation research to evaluate health programmes to transform school settings into healthy learning environments for children.

33486126,"Origin of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium in Bali and Papua, Indonesia.","Global distributions of zoonotic pathogens have been strongly affected by the history of human dispersal and domestication of livestock. The pork tapeworm Taenia solium is distributed worldwide as the cause of neurocysticercosis, one of the most serious neglected tropical diseases. T. solium has been reported in Indonesia but only endemic to restricted areas such as Bali and Papua. Previous studies indicated the distinctiveness of a mitochondrial haplotype confirmed in Papua, but only one isolate has been examined to date. In this study, genetic characterization of T. solium and pigs in Bali and Papua was conducted to clarify the distributional history of the parasite. Mitochondrial haplotype network analysis clearly showed that Indonesian T. solium comprises a unique haplogroup which was the first to diverge among Asian genotypes, indicating its single origin and the fact that it was not introduced in the recent past from other area in Asia in which it is endemic. Although phylogenetic analysis based on the mitochondrial D-loop revealed multiple origins of pigs in Bali and Papua, the majority of pigs belonged to the Pacific Clade, which is widely dispersed throughout the Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) and Oceania due to Neolithic human dispersal. Given the results of our network analysis, it is likely that the Pacific Clade pigs played a key role in the dispersal of T. solium. The data suggest that T. solium was introduced from mainland Asia into Western Indonesia, including Bali, by modern humans in the late Pleistocene, or in the early to middle Holocene along with the Pacific Clade pigs. Introduction into New Guinea most likely occurred in the late Holocene through the spread of Pacific Clade pigs. Over time, T. solium has been eradicated from most of Indonesia through the middle to modern ages owing to religious and cultural practices.","Yanagida T, Swastika K, Dharmawan NS, Sako Y, Wandra T, Ito A, Okamoto M",Parasitol Int,2021 Aug,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
31678236,"Soil-transmitted helminth infections and taeniasis on Samosir Island, Indonesia.","Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections are important causes of morbidity in poorer areas of developing countries, with high endemicity in Southeast Asia. Humans are most often exposed to the infective forms of STHs in areas with sub-standard sanitation. The number of STH infections globally was estimated at 1.5 billion in 2018. In Indonesia, the prevalence of STH infections ranges from 2.5% to 62.0%. STH and taeniasis infections were evaluated on Samosir Island, North Sumatra, Indonesia. Field surveys were conducted in January 2003, February 2005, and February 2006 in Simanindo Subdistrict, with a subsequent survey conducted in the subdistricts of Simanindo and Ronggurnihuta in September 2015. A total of 371 individuals were screened between 2003 and 2006 and 368 were screened in 2015 (314 from Simanindo and 54 from Ronggurnihuta). Fecal samples were collected and examined microscopically by the Kato-Katz technique. The prevalence of STH infections in Simanindo for the years 2003, 2005, 2006, and 2015 was 41.4%, 52.2%, 55.7%, and 46.8%, respectively. The 2015 prevalence of STH infections in Ronggurnihuta was 66.7%. Taenia asiatica taeniasis prevalence was 3.4% and 2.2% for the years 2003 and 2005, respectively, with no cases detected in 2006 or 2015. The prevalence of STH infections in Simanindo and Ronggurnihuta was similar to other STH prevalence values reported for Indonesia. Country-level values have not changed substantially from those reported in the 1980s and 1990s, where prevalence ranged from 40% to 70%. Improvement of personal hygiene and environmental sanitation for control of STH infections on Samosir Island will require collaboration among multiple sectors.","Wandra T, Darlan DM, Yulfi H, Purba IE, Sato MO, Budke CM, Ito A",Acta Trop,2020 Feb,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
26320098,Taenia solium Cysticercosis--The lessons of history.,"Human taeniasis as well as porcine and human cysticercosis--caused by the pork tapeworm Taenia solium--are ancient diseases. The fact that pigs were considered impure in the ancient Greece and that the Koran prohibited the consumption of pork, were likely related to the knowledge that cysticercosis may affect swine. Evidence suggests that human cysticercosis was also present in the ancient Egypt and Rome. During the Renaissance, the causative agent was properly identified and human cases were recognized. Confirmation that both taeniasis and cysticercosis were caused by the same parasite was provided during the 19th Century by German pathologists. During the 20th Century, bouts of human cysticercosis in non-endemic regions left us valuable lessons on the mechanisms of disease acquisition and spread. These included a large series of neurocysticercosis cases in the United Kingdom that occurred after the return of troops stationed in India (which demonstrated that symptoms may occur years after infection), the epidemic of cysticercosis-related epilepsy in the Ekari people of Papua New Guinea occurring after the gift of pigs with cysticercosis received from Indonesia (demonstrating the fast establishment of endemic transmission and the impact of cysticercosis in epilepsy frequency), and the occurrence of neurocysticercosis among members of an Orthodox Jewish community of New York City, related to Latin American Taenia carriers working in their houses (highlighting the fact that cysticercosis transmission do not require the presence of infected pigs). These lessons of history have significantly contributed to our current knowledge on this disease.","Del Brutto OH, Garcia HH",J Neurol Sci,2015 Dec 15,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
25553796,Helminth-induced IgE and protection against allergic disorders.,"The immune response against helminths and allergens is generally characterized by high levels of IgE and increased numbers of Th2 cells, eosinophils, and mast cells, yet the clinical outcome with respect to immediate hypersensitivity and inflammation is clearly not the same. High levels of IgE are seen to allergens during helminth infections; however, these IgE responses do not translate into allergy symptoms. This chapter summarizes the evidence of the association between helminth infections and allergic disorders. It discusses how helminth infection can lead to IgE cross-reactivity with allergens and how this IgE has poor biological activity. This information is important for developing new diagnostic methods and treatments for allergic disorders in low-to-middle-income countries.","Hamid F, Amoah AS, van Ree R, Yazdanbakhsh M",Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,2015,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
20624531,Schistosomiasis japonica control and research needs.,"Schistosomiasis japonica, a chronic and debilitating disease caused by the blood fluke Schistosoma japonicum, is still of considerable economic and public health concern in the People's Republic of China, the Philippines, and Indonesia. Despite major progress made over the past several decades with the control of schistosomiasis japonica in the aforementioned countries, the disease is emerging in some areas. We review the epidemiological status and transmission patterns of schistosomiasis japonica, placing it into a historical context, and discuss experiences and lessons with national control efforts. Our analyses reveal that an integrated control approach, implemented through intersectoral collaboration, is essential to bring down the prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma japonicum infections and disease-related morbidity, and to sustain these parameters at low levels. The need for innovation and a sufficiently flexible control approach to adapt interventions in response to the changing nature and challenges of schistosomiasis control from the initial phase of morbidity control to the final state of elimination is emphasised. The aim of the presentation and the analyses is to inspire researchers and disease control managers elsewhere in Asia, Africa, and the Americas to harness the experiences gained and the lessons presented here to improve the control and eventual elimination of schistosomiasis and parasitic diseases.","Zhou XN, Bergquist R, Leonardo L, Yang GJ, Yang K, Sudomo M, Olveda R",Adv Parasitol,2010,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia

The chabertiid Cyclodontostomum purvisi and the heligmonellid Odilia mackerrasae have been described previously from endemic murids. Hasanuddinia pogonomyos n. sp. can be distinguished from its congeners by the number of ridges in the synlophe, length of spicules and having a vagina with a dorsal diverticulum. Odilia dividua n. sp. is larger than its congeners, has a longer oesophagus, relatively shorter spicules and larger eggs. Pogonomystrongylus domaensis n. gen., n. sp. differs from all other genera in the Heligmonellidae in the characters of the synlophe, 7-10 ridges oriented sub frontally with a single left ventral ridge hypertrophied. Species richness of the nematode assemblages of P. loriae and P. macrourus are comparable to those of Abeomelomys sevia, Chiruromys vates and Coccymys rummleri when numbers of hosts examined are considered.

30235817,Shadow Puppets and Neglected Diseases: Evaluating a Health Promotion Performance in Rural Indonesia.,"'Rama and the Worm' is a shadow puppet production targeting neglected diseases in Central Java. It is an entertainment-based intervention study to promote health by reducing the impact of parasitic diseases such as soil-transmitted helminths (STH). The study uses traditional Javanese shadow puppetry (wayang kulit) as a vehicle in village communities to disseminate health messages and promote behaviour change to prevent diseases caused, primarily, by inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene. The health education messages contained in the play, although using traditional characters and themes, required the creation of a completely new narrative script, using characters and plot lines familiar to the wayang kulit repertoire, but placing them in new situations that relate specifically to health promotion objectives. The intervention was piloted in a village in Central Java, Indonesia using a pre/post design with both qualitative and quantitative analysis. A total of 96 male and female villagers, aged between 7 and 87 years, provided both baseline and follow up data. Participant knowledge and behaviours related to gastrointestinal and helminth-related disease were assessed before and after the intervention through a questionnaire administered by interview. Results revealed statistically significant improvements in both knowledge (48.6% pre-intervention score vs. 62.8% post-intervention score, p < 0.001) and behaviour (77.4% vs. 80.6%, p = 0.004) related to gastrointestinal and helminth disease. Findings of the study indicate the wayang kulit performance is an effective health education tool. The results provide proof of concept with scaling up the next step forward. The wayang kulit production provides a significant additional component for an integrated, comprehensive approach to reduction and elimination of STH infection.","Kurscheid J, Bendrups D, Susilo J, Williams C, Amaral S, Laksono B, Stewart DE, Gray DJ",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2018 Sep 19,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
36478466,Mapping schistosomiasis risk in Southeast Asia: a systematic review and geospatial analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis is a water-borne parasitic disease estimated to have infected >140 million people globally in 2019, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. Within the goal of eliminating schistosomiasis as a public health problem by 2030 in the World Health Organization (WHO) Roadmap for neglected tropical diseases, other regions cannot be neglected. Empirical estimates of the disease burden in Southeast Asia largely remain unavailable. METHODS: We undertook a systematic review to identify empirical survey data on schistosomiasis prevalence in Southeast Asia using the Web of Science, ScienceDirect, PubMed and the Global Atlas of Helminth Infections, from inception to 5 February 2021. We then conducted advanced Bayesian geostatistical analysis to assess the geographical distribution of infection risk at a high spatial resolution (5 x 5 km) using the prevalence, number of infected individuals and doses needed for preventive chemotherapy. RESULTS: We identified 494 Schistosoma japonicum surveys in the Philippines and Indonesia, and 285 in Cambodia and Laos for S. mekongi. The latest estimates suggest that 225 [95% credible interval (CrI): 168-285] thousand in the endemic areas of Southeast Asian population were infected in 2018. The highest prevalence of schistosomiasis was 3.86% (95% CrI: 3.40-4.31) in Laos whereas the lowest was 0.29% in Cambodia (95% CrI: 0.22-0.36). The estimated number of praziquantel doses needed per year was 1.99 million (95% CrI: 1.92-2.03 million) for the entire population in endemic areas of Southeast Asia. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of schistosomiasis remains far from the WHO goal and our estimates highlighted areas to target with strengthened interventions against schistosomiasis.","Luo C, Wang Y, Su Q, Zhu J, Tang S, Bergquist R, Zhang Z, Hu Y",Int J Epidemiol,2023 Aug 2,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
20338054,"Does treatment of intestinal helminth infections influence malaria? Background and methodology of a longitudinal study of clinical, parasitological and immunological parameters in Nangapanda, Flores, Indonesia (ImmunoSPIN Study).","BACKGROUND: Given that helminth infections are thought to have strong immunomodulatory activity, the question whether helminth infections might affect responses to malaria antigens needs to be addressed. Different cross-sectional studies using diverse methodologies have reported that helminth infections might either exacerbate or reduce the severity of malaria attacks. The same discrepancies have been reported for parasitemia. METHODS/DESIGN: To determine the effect of geohelminth infections and their treatment on malaria infection and disease outcome, as well as on immunological parameters, the area of Nangapanda on Flores Island, Indonesia, where malaria and helminth parasites are co-endemic was selected for a longitudinal study. Here a Double-blind randomized trial will be performed, incorporating repeated treatment with albendazole (400 mg) or placebo at three monthly intervals. Household characteristic data, anthropometry, the presence of intestinal helminth and Plasmodium spp infections, and the incidence of malaria episodes are recorded. In vitro cultures of whole blood, stimulated with a number of antigens, mitogens and toll like receptor ligands provide relevant immunological parameters at baseline and following 1 and 2 years of treatment rounds. The primary outcome of the study is the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax infection. The secondary outcome will be incidence and severity of malaria episodes detected via both passive and active follow-up. The tertiary outcome is the inflammatory cytokine profile in response to parasite antigens. The project also facilitates the transfer of state of the art methodologies and technologies, molecular diagnosis of parasitic diseases, immunology and epidemiology from Europe to Indonesia. DISCUSSION: The study will provide data on the effect of helminth infections on malaria. It will also give information on anthelminthic treatment efficacy and effectiveness and could help develop evidence-based policymaking.

This study aimed to investigate the association of STH infections with nutritional status and anemia among PSC in Nangapanda subdistrict, Ende, East Nusa Tenggara. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey involving PSC ranging from 12 to 59 months old from Nangapanda subdistrict, Ende district, East Nusa Tenggara was performed. Socio-demographic, breastfeeding, and complementary feeding information was obtained from structured questionnaires, while nutritional and anemia status was determined from anthropometry and hemoglobin measurements, respectively. Anthropometric z-scores were calculated based on the World Health Organization 2006 standards and stool samples were examined using Kato-Katz method. RESULTS: A total of 393 PSC randomly selected from 22 villages were examined. The prevalence of underweight, stunting, wasting, and anemia were 33.1%, 40.2%, 17.1%, and 60.3%, respectively. STH infection, predominated by Ascaris lumbricoides, was found in 160 (58.8%) PSC. Single STH infection, but not multiple infection, was independently associated with a lower risk of anemia (odds ratio [OR] 0.320, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.126-0.809, p = 0.016). Similar association with anemia was also found on mild STH infection (OR 0.318 [95% CI: 0.114-0.887], p = 0.029). On the other hand, younger children were found to have a higher risk of anemia and stunting. None of the examined variables were independently associated with underweight and wasting. CONCLUSION: STH infection as well as anemia and malnutrition were prevalent in this region. However in this study, current STH infections seemed to have minimal negative impact on children's nutritional status.","Djuardi Y, Lazarus G, Stefanie D, Fahmida U, Ariawan I, Supali T",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,2021 Jun,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia

35275932,Community perceptions and acceptability of mass drug administration for the control of neglected tropical diseases in Asia-Pacific countries: A systematic scoping review of qualitative research.,"BACKGROUND: Preventative chemotherapy and mass drug administration have been identified as effective strategies for the prevention, treatment, control and elimination of several NTDs in the Asia-Pacific region. Qualitative research can provide in-depth insight into the social dynamics and processes underlying effective implementation of and adherence to mass drug administration programs. This scoping review examines published qualitative literature to examine factors influencing community perceptions and acceptability of mass drug administration approaches to control NTDs in the Asia-Pacific region. METHODOLOGY: Twenty-four peer reviewed published papers reporting qualitative data from community members and stakeholders engaged in the implementation of mass drug administration programs were identified as eligible for inclusion. FINDINGS: This systematic scoping review presents available data from studies focussing on lymphatic filariasis, soil-transmitted helminths and scabies in eight national settings (India, Indonesia, Philippines, Bangladesh, Laos, American Samoa, Papua New Guinea, Fiji). The review highlights the profoundly social nature of individual, interpersonal and institutional influences on community perceptions of willingness to participate in mass drug administration programs for control of neglected tropical diseases (NTD). Future NTD research and control efforts would benefit from a stronger qualitative social science lens to mass drug administration implementation, a commitment to understanding and addressing the social and structural determinants of NTDs and NTD control in complex settings, and efforts to engage local communities as equal partners and experts in the co-design of mass drug administration and other efforts to prevent, treat, control and eliminate NTDs. CONCLUSION: For many countries in the Asia-Pacific region, the ""low hanging fruit has been picked"" in terms of where mass drug administration has worked and transmission has been stopped. The settings that remain-such as remote areas of Fiji and Papua New Guinea, or large, highly populated, multi-cultural urban settings in India and Indonesia-present huge challenges going forward.","Mitchell E, Kelly-Hanku A, Krentel A, Romani L, Robinson LJ, Vaz Nery S, Kaldor J, Steer AC, Bell S",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,2022 Mar,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
32013848,Reduce Disease Burden of Human Schistosomiasis in Asia Through Biological Control.,"Schistosomiasis is a chronic parasitic disease caused by a trematode blood fluke of the genus Schistosoma that belongs to the Schistosomatidae family. It is a neglected disease in different regions of Asia. In this review, 218 articles (between 2000 and 2017) related to the topic were collected from PubMed and Google scholar and reviewed. After thoroughly reading collected articles, due to irrelevant topic requirements, 94 articles were excluded. Articles that have data associated with Asian regions are considered. In Asia, the disease is prevalent in China, Philippines, Indonesia, Yemen, Nepal and Laos, etc. While in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, the disease is not endemic and very few cases were reported. The disease was eliminated from Japan and Iran. The current review highlights the geographical distribution among Asian countries, transmission patterns, diagnosis, control strategies based on the use of anthelmintic plants and management practices implemented in Asia for the control of schistosomiasis. However, new implementations to treat schistosomiasis in humans should be proved to eliminate the disease finally in the future. This review emphasizes the biological control of schistosomiasis for the eradication of the disease from Asia in the near future.","Saleem S, Ahmed H, Siddiqui T, Kilinc SG, Khan A, Afzal MS, Simsek S",Mini Rev Med Chem,2020,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia

A triple drug combination of the anti-filarial drugs ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine (DEC) and albendazole (IDA) has been shown to be safe and effective for achieving sustained clearance of microfilariae (Mf) of the filarial parasite Wuchereria bancrofti from human blood. However, the triple drug combination has not been previously been evaluated for treatment of brugian filariasis, which accounts for about 10% of the global LF burden. This hospital-based clinical trial compared the safety and efficacy of IDA with that of the standard treatment (DEC plus albendazole, DA) in persons with Brugia timori infections on Sumba island, Indonesia. Fifty-five asymptomatic persons with B. timori Mf were treated with either a single oral dose of IDA (28 subjects) or with DEC plus albendazole (DA, 27 subjects). Participants were actively monitored for adverse events (AE) for two days after treatment by nurses and physicians who were masked regarding treatment assignments. Passive monitoring was performed by clinical teams that visited participant's home villages for an additional five days. Microfilaremia was assessed by membrane filtration of 1 ml night blood at baseline, at 24h and one year after treatment. IDA was more effective than DA for completely clearing Mf at 24 hours (25/28, 89% vs. 8/27, 30%, P < 0.001). By 12 months after treatment, only one of 27 IDA recipients had Mf in their blood (4%) vs. 10 of 25 (40%) in persons treated with DA (P = 0.002). Approximately 90% of participants had antibodies to recombinant filarial antigen BmR1 at baseline. Antibody prevalence decreased to approximately 30% in both treatment groups at 12 months. About 45% of persons in both treatment groups experienced AE such as fever, muscle aches, lower back, joint and abdominal pain. These were mostly mild and most common during the first two days after treatment. No participant experienced a severe or serious AE. This study showed that IDA was well-tolerated and significantly more effective for clearing B. timori Mf from the blood than DA. Larger studies should be performed to further assess the safety and efficacy of IDA as a mass drug administration regimen to eliminate brugian filariasis.

35169362,"Morphology of Taenia Asiatica Simalungun, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: One of the methods to identify Taenia species that infect humans morphologically is microscopic examination of the gravid proglottid and the scolex. By counting the number of uterine branches in a gravid proglottid, the species of Taenia can be identified. According to literatures, the number of uterine branches of proglottid varies between 11 - 31 and the scolex has a rostelum and apical pit without hooklet. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the morphology of scolex, to see the presence of rostelum, hooklet, oral sucker, and apical pit using SEM. METHODS: We investigated 19 gravid proglottids of T. asiatica from Simalungun District, North Sumatra Province using dissecting microscope examination and one scolex using light microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM). RESULTS: The findings showed that the number of uterine branches of the gravid proglottid was 16, and neither rostelum nor apical pit in the scolex was found. However, a curved shape at the apex of the scolex was identified and named as snout. CONCLUSION: The number of uterine branches of T. asiatica that was found in Simalungun District, North Sumatra Province was 16 and the morphology of the scolex was slightly different from that was reported previously. We suggest that the morphology of Taenia asiatica should be further reviewed, probably of the differences in morphology of Taenia asiatica according to its endemic area.","Zein U, Lim H, Sardjono TW",Med Arch,2021 Oct,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
34928944,"Prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth infections, schistosomiasis, and lymphatic filariasis before and after preventive chemotherapy initiation in the Philippines: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","OBJECTIVE: To estimate the impact of preventive chemotherapy on the prevalence and intensity of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections, schistosomiasis, and lymphatic filariasis in the Philippines, using systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: We included reports reporting prevalence of STH infections, schistosomiasis, or lymphatic filariasis in the Philippines published until 31 March 2021. Peer-reviewed studies were identified in electronic databases. Grey literature reports by the University of the Philippines and the Department of Health were also included. Pooled infection prevalence, before and after the initiation of preventive chemotherapy, stratified by age group, was calculated using the inverse variance heterogeneity model. FINDINGS: A total of 109 reports were included in the review and meta-analysis. Overall prevalence of moderate-heavy intensity Ascaris lumbricoides (6.6%) and Trichuris trichiura (2.7%) infection after initiation of preventive chemotherapy were significantly lower than the prevalence prior to initiation (23.6% for A. lumbricoides and 12.2% for T. trichiura). Prevalence reductions were also found in school and preschool-age children for A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura. Studies conducted after preventive chemotherapy initiation had significantly lower overall prevalence of moderate-heavy intensity schistosomiasis (3.1% vs 0.2%) and of schistosomiasis in school-age children (30.5% vs 1%). Pooled prevalence of lymphatic filariasis prior to preventive chemotherapy initiation was 3.2% across 12 provinces, while currently only two provinces still have prevalence of more than 1%. There were no published studies reporting prevalence of lymphatic filariasis after initiation of preventive chemotherapy. Heterogeneity was high with I2 mostly above 90%. CONCLUSION: The burden of STH infections and schistosomiasis in children were significantly lower in studies conducted following the initiation of preventive chemotherapy. Eliminating morbidity and interrupting transmission, however, may require expanded control initiatives including community-wide treatment, and improved water, sanitation, and hygiene. Lymphatic filariasis burden has decreased since the implementation of preventive chemotherapy, with all but two provinces having reached the elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem.","Delos Trinos JPCR, Wulandari LPL, Clarke N, Belizario V Jr, Kaldor J, Nery SV",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,2021 Dec,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
20580905,Polyparasitism and its impact on the immune system.,"Parasitic infections are common in many tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world and concomitant infection, polyparasitism, is the rule rather than the exception in such areas. At the immunological level, different parasites induce quite different responses characterised, for example, by protozoa that polarise responses towards Th1, whilst helminths are strong Th2 and regulatory T cell inducers. The question of how the co-existence of such parasites within the same host might influence the immunological responses to each species and, more importantly, whether such interactions affect resistance, susceptibility or clinical outcome, needs to be addressed in well-designed studies of sufficient power. The current paper discusses what we know as well as the gaps in our knowledge of polyparasitism.","Supali T, Verweij JJ, Wiria AE, Djuardi Y, Hamid F, Kaisar MM, Wammes LJ, van Lieshout L, Luty AJ, Sartono E, Yazdanbakhsh M",Int J Parasitol,2010 Aug 15,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
26813007,"Epidemiological surveys of, and research on, soil-transmitted helminths in Southeast Asia: a systematic review.","Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections of humans fall within the World Health Organization's (WHO) grouping termed the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). It is estimated that they affect approximately 1.4 billion people worldwide. A significant proportion of these infections are in the population of Southeast Asia. This review analyses published data on STH prevalence and intensity in Southeast Asia over the time period of 1900 to the present to describe age related patterns in these epidemiological measures. This is with a focus on the four major parasite species affecting humans; namely Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and the hookworms; Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale. Data were also collected on the diagnostic methods used in the published surveys and how the studies were designed to facilitate comparative analyses of recorded patterns and changes therein over time. PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Global Atlas of Helminth Infections search engines were used to identify studies on STH in Southeast Asia with the search based on the major key words, and variants on, ""soil-transmitted helminth"" ""Ascaris"" ""Trichuris"" ""hookworm"" and the country name. A total of 280 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria from 11 Southeast Asian countries; Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Timor-Leste and Vietnam. It was concluded that the epidemiological patterns of STH infection by age and species mix in Southeast Asia are similar to those reported in other parts of the world. In the published studies there were a large number of different diagnostic methods used with differing sensitivities and specificities, which makes comparison of the results both within and between countries difficult. There is a clear requirement to standardise the methods of both STH diagnosis in faecal material and how the intensity of infection is recorded and reported in future STH research and in monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of the impact of continuing and expanding mass drug administration (MDA) programmes.","Dunn JC, Turner HC, Tun A, Anderson RM",Parasit Vectors,2016 Jan 27,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
18534900,Schistosomiasis in Indonesia: past and present.,"Schistosomiasis is endemic in Indonesia in two isolated areas, Lindu valley and Napu valley, both located in the Province of Central Sulawesi. In 1940, a prevalence survey was initiated in Lake Lindu, which indicated a Schistosoma japonicum infection prevalence of 56% among the population of Anca, Tomado and Langko villages. Another survey was conducted in 1973 in Napu valley and very high infection prevalences of up to 72% were found among the population in Winowanga village. Since then, comprehensive studies on the epidemiology and the effects of control have been carried out in 24 endemic villages in both areas. Over the past six decades, schistosomiasis control has been implemented and the average prevalence is now much lower than before the control programme was launched. In 2006, it was 0.49% in 7 villages in Lindu valley. In Napu valley, the average infection prevalence among the population of 17 villages was 1.08% in the same year. Again in 2006, the prevalence of infection in snails ranged from 0 to 13.4% and from 0 to 9.1% in Napu and Lindu valleys, respectively. The highest prevalence among snails was found in Dodolo village. The prevalence of S. japonicum in the reservoir host Rattus spp. ranged from 0 to 20% and the highest prevalence was again found in Dodolo village. Contemporary data suggest that transmission of schistosomiasis is still ongoing in Indonesia despite regular surveillance and control activities covering the whole endemic area.","Garjito TA, Sudomo M, Abdullah, Dahlan M, Nurwidayati A",Parasitol Int,2008 Sep,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
16387528,What is Asian Taenia?,"Asian Taenia is a human tapeworm which was first recognized in Taiwan aborigines and subsequently from Asian countries: Korea, Indonesia, Vietnam, and China. It was originally described as T. asiatica Eom and Rim, 1993 based on the morphology in its adult and larval stage. A taxonomic disagreement on whether it is species or subspecies level is mainly due to the morphological similarity of this tapeworm with T. saginata, but a sympatric distribution of these two tapeworms is also known in China. The life cycle is quite distinct from T. saginata in using the pig as intermediate host and parasitizing visceral organs such as liver, lung and omentum. A long unresolved question in Asian countries concerns the inconsistency between worm ratio and the food preferences was clarified with this viscerotropic tapeworm. Molecular biological differentiation is possible with DNA techniques and a complete genome of mtDNA was sequenced recently which may provide a resource for comparative mitochondrial genomics and systematic studies of parasitic cestodes. This is a young parasite discovered most recently with many research questions yet to be clarified.",Eom KS,Parasitol Int,2006,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia

34993634,The prevalence of human trichuriasis in Asia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Trichuriasis is one of the most common soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections, affecting populations globally. The condition is particularly prevalent in tropical and subtropical areas with low levels of sanitation and poor living conditions. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the prevalence of Trichuris trichiura infection in Asia at the country and region level. Multiple databases/academic search engines (Web of Science, PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus, and Google Scholar) were searched for literature on T. trichiura prevalence in Asia published through January 2021. Pooled prevalence was determined using the meta-package in R (version 3.6.1). Out of 13,836 articles, 226 studies (5,439,500 individuals) from 26 countries met the inclusion criteria. Of the 226 studies, 151 were community-based studies that included individuals across the age spectrum, while 75 studies focused on school children (typically in the 5-16 years age range). The overall T. trichiura pooled prevalence was 15.3% (95% CI: 12.4-19.1%), with a pooled prevalence of 13.3% (95% CI: 10.0-17.1%) for the community studies and 20.9% (95% CI: 14.7-27.9%) for the studies only including school children. For studies including all age groups, individuals in the 1-15 years age group had the highest pooled prevalence at 23.4% (95% CI: 1.7-49.4%). There was a significant difference found in overall pooled prevalence by sex (p < 0.001) and community type (rural versus urban) (p < 0.001). Although prevalence appears to be decreasing, study findings suggest that T. trichiura infection continues to be a public health problem in Asia. Therefore, control programs focused on at-risk individuals in endemic areas are needed.","Badri M, Olfatifar M, Wandra T, Budke CM, Mahmoudi R, Abdoli A, Hajialilo E, Pestehchian N, Ghaffarifar F, Foroutan M, Hashemipour S, Sotoodeh S, Samimi R, Eslahi AV",Parasitol Res,2022 Jan,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia

NTDs were eventually included as awareness is heightened on these diseases affecting poor and developing countries. Researches on clonorchiasis and opisthorchiasis unravel the mechanism by which these diseases eventually predispose to cholangiocarcinoma. The liver cancer associated with these liver fluke infections necessitate the need to clarify the global burden of disease of these infections. The magnitude of these liver fluke diseases in endemic countries like China, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Thailand is described. Success in elimination of lymphatic filariasis in PR China and Cambodia is highlighted to show how intensified multisectoral collaboration and strong political become strong ingredients in elimination of parasitic diseases like LF.

31295430,Taeniasis and cysticercosis in Asia: A review with emphasis on molecular approaches and local lifestyles.,"Taeniasis is an important parasitic condition in Asia, especially since all three human-infecting Taenia spp., Taenia solium, Taenia saginata, and Taenia asiatica are found in this region. These three species are believed to be sympatrically distributed, with the largest disease burden found in remote and rural areas where people raise pigs and cattle in a traditional manner. Recent studies revealed that T. asiatica and T. saginata are genetically-related sister species that are not completely reproductively isolated from each other. Current evidence indicates that most T. asiatica adult worms are hybrid-derived descendants. Moving forward, nuclear DNA analysis will be critical in further assessing the species circulating locally. Lifestyle choices, such as the consumption of undercooked meat, are important in maintaining the life cycles of these parasites. In addition, poor hygiene and sanitation, in highly endemic areas, make disease control difficult, resulting in the need for sustainable education programs. An overview of the present situation of taeniasis and cysticercosis in Asia is provided, followed by a discussion of molecular approaches to species assessment and the impact of human lifestyles on parasite transmission.","Ito A, Li T, Wandra T, Dekumyoy P, Yanagida T, Okamoto M, Budke CM",Acta Trop,2019 Oct,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
12358626,Treatment of Brugia timori and Wuchereria bancrofti infections in Indonesia using DEC or a combination of DEC and albendazole: adverse reactions and short-term effects on microfilariae.,"Filariasis caused by Brugia timori and Wuchereria bancrofti is an important public health problem on Alor island, East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. To implement a control programme, adverse reactions and short-term effects on the microfilaria (mf) density were studied following a divided dose of diethylcarbamazine (DEC, 6 mg/kg body weight - 100 mg on day 1 and the rest on day 3) or a single dose of DEC (6 mg/kg body weight on day 3) and albendazole (Alb, 400 mg). In order to define the most appropriate regimen, 30 persons infected with B. timori were treated in the hospital and results were compared with those obtained from the treatment of 27 persons infected with W. bancrofti. Adverse reactions consisted of systemic reactions such as fever, headache, myalgia, itching and local reactions such as adenolymphangitis. Fever experienced by a number of patients in both treatment groups generally occurred 12-24 h after drug administration and lasted up to 2 days. Adenolymphangitis tended to occur later and was resolved within 4 days. The number of W. bancrofti patients suffering from adverse reactions was lower and the reactions were milder than those of the B. timori patients. There was no difference in adverse reactions between DEC alone and DEC-Alb treatment for either infection. The geometric mean mf count decreased on day 7 in the B. timori infected patients from 234 mf/ml in the DEC group and from 257 mf/ml in the DEC-Alb group to 7 and 8 mf/ml, respectively. The mf densities of the W. bancrofti infected patients decreased on day 7 from 214 mf/ml in the DEC group and from 559 mf/ml in the DEC-Alb group to 15 and 14 mf/ml, respectively. Our data indicate that the microfilaricidal effect of the drugs is achieved more rapidly for B. timori, which is associated with more adverse reactions than W. bancrofti. In addition, 111 B. timori infected persons were treated in the community with DEC-Alb in one selected village. The adverse reactions and the reduction of mf density was similar to the findings of the hospital-based study. In this group, there was a strong correlation of mf density with the frequency and severity of adverse reactions. The addition of Alb resulted in no additional adverse reactions compared with DEC treatment alone and can also be used for the treatment of B. timori infection. In Indonesia, where the prevalence of intestinal helminths is high, the use of a combination of DEC and Alb to control lymphatic filariasis may also have impact on the control of intestinal helminths.","Supali T, Ismid IS, Ruckert P, Fischer P",Trop Med Int Health,2002 Oct,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
29486796,Differential human gut microbiome assemblages during soil-transmitted helminth infections in Indonesia and Liberia.,"BACKGROUND: The human intestine and its microbiota is the most common infection site for soil-transmitted helminths (STHs), which affect the well-being of ~ 1.5 billion people worldwide. The complex cross-kingdom interactions are not well understood. RESULTS: A cross-sectional analysis identified conserved microbial signatures positively or negatively associated with STH infections across Liberia and Indonesia, and longitudinal samples analysis from a double-blind randomized trial showed that the gut microbiota responds to deworming but does not transition closer to the uninfected state. The microbiomes of individuals able to self-clear the infection had more alike microbiome assemblages compared to individuals who remained infected. One bacterial taxon (Lachnospiracae) was negatively associated with infection in both countries, and 12 bacterial taxa were significantly associated with STH infection in both countries, including Olsenella (associated with reduced gut inflammation), which also significantly reduced in abundance following clearance of infection. Microbial community gene abundances were also affected by deworming. Functional categories identified as associated with STH infection included arachidonic acid metabolism; arachidonic acid is the precursor for pro-inflammatory leukotrienes that threaten helminth survival, and our findings suggest that some modulation of arachidonic acid activity in the STH-infected gut may occur through the increase of arachidonic acid metabolizing bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we identify specific members of the gut microbiome that discriminate between moderately/heavily STH-infected and non-infected states across very diverse geographical regions using two different statistical methods. We also identify microbiome-encoded biological functions associated with the STH infections, which are associated potentially with STH survival strategies, and changes in the host environment. These results provide a novel insight of the cross-kingdom interactions in the human gut ecosystem by unlocking the microbiome assemblages at taxonomic, genetic, and functional levels so that advances towards key mechanistic studies can be made.","Rosa BA, Supali T, Gankpala L, Djuardi Y, Sartono E, Zhou Y, Fischer K, Martin J, Tyagi R, Bolay FK, Fischer PU, Yazdanbakhsh M, Mitreva M",Microbiome,2018 Feb 28,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
23827192,Current status of schistosomiasis in Indonesia.,"Schistosomiasis japonica is currently endemic in three very isolated areas in Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia. Integrated schistosomiasis control programmes implemented in the Lindu and Napu Valleys during the period of 1982-2005 have successfully reduced the prevalence of schistosomiasis from 37% to 1% in Napu Valley and from 37% to 0.6% in Lindu Valley. Human prevalence surveys reveal that the prevalence tended to increase during the period of 2008-2011. The average prevalence fluctuated between 0.3% and 4.8% in Napu Valley and between 0.8% and 3.2% in Lindu Valley. During this period, the percentage of rats that were infected fluctuated between 7.9% and 18.2% in Napu Valley and between 6.7% and 9.8% in Lindu Valley. The average percentage of infected snails was 2.6% and 2.1% in the Napu and Lindu Valleys, respectively. In 2008, schistosomiasis was also found in a separate but adjacent place, i.e. Bada Valley. The prevalence of schistosomiasis in endemic villages in this area was 0.8% in 2008 and 5.9% in 2010, while the percentage of infected snails was 1% in 2010.

33162989,Current Status of Schistosomiasis Control and Prospects for Elimination in the Dongting Lake Region of the People's Republic of China.,"Schistosomiasis japonica is an ancient parasitic disease that has severely impacted human health causing a substantial disease burden not only to the Chinese people but also residents of other countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia and, before the 1970s, Japan. Since the founding of the new People's Republic of China (P. R. China), effective control strategies have been implemented with the result that the prevalence of schistosomiasis japonica has decreased markedly in the past 70 years. Historically, the Dongting Lake region in Hunan province is recognised as one of the most highly endemic for schistosomiasis in the P.R. China. The area is characterized by vast marshlands outside the lake embankments and, until recently, the presence of large numbers of domestic animals such as bovines, goats and sheep that can act as reservoir hosts for Schistosoma japonicum. Considerable social, economic and environmental changes have expanded the Oncomelania hupensis hupensis intermediate snail host areas in the Dongting lake region increasing the potential for both the emergence of new hot spots for schistosomiasis transmission, and for its re-emergence in areas where infection is currently under control. In this paper, we review the history, the current endemic status of schistosomiasis and the control strategies in operation in the Dongting Lake region. We also explore epidemiological factors contributing to S. japonicum transmission and highlight key research findings from studies undertaken on schistosomiasis mainly in Hunan but also other endemic Chinese provinces over the past 10 years. We also consider the implications of these research findings on current and future approaches that can lead to the sustainable integrated control and final elimination of schistosomiasis from the P.

METHODS: 229 primary school children who were positive for A. lumbricoides in their stool were recruited in the study. 123 children received single-dose of 400 mg albendazole and 106 children received single-dose 500 mg of mebendazole. After 1 week, their stools were examined for the cure rate (CR) and egg reduction rate (ERR). Egg culture was also performed and observation was made on week-1, -3, -4. RESULTS: have shown a non-significant difference in CR 96.7%vs. 100% and ERR of 99.3%vs. 100.0% for albendazole and mebendazole groups respectively (P>0.05). In-vitro egg culture has shown trends of decrease in the percentage of the unfertilized eggs and in >/= 2 cell eggs in both treatment groups (P<0.05). The embryonated eggs from the albendazole groups has shown an increase from 7.3% on week-1 to 13.8% on week-4, whilst the mebendazole group has shown a constant increase during the whole 4 weeks of culture from 7.5% to 28.3% (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: No evidence of drug resistance is noted so far from the area of North-Western part of Indonesia. In addition, although both drugs showed incomplete ovicidal effects, single-dose albendazole is better than mebendazole in sterilizing A. lumbricoides eggs.","Lubis IN, Pasaribu S, Lubis CP",Asian Pac J Trop Med,2012 Aug,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of cyclophyllid cestodes (Taeniidae and Mesocestoididae) in Mongolian sheepdogs using copro-DNA analysis. Sheepdog fecal samples (n = 1242) were collected from five ecological zones (mountain taiga, forest-steppe, steppe, desert-steppe, and desert) and four geographical regions (Western, Khangai, Central, and Eastern) within 20 of the country's 21 provinces. Among the 1242 samples, 201 (16.2%) tested positive for mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) and ribosomal 12S rRNA encoding genes of cyclophyllid cestodes. Prevalence in the mountain taiga, forest-steppe, steppe, desert-steppe, and desert zones was 29.2%, 15.4%, 15.1%, 20.1%, and 9.1%, respectively. Prevalence in the Western, Khangai, Central, and Eastern regions was 19.9%, 18.6%, 12.1%, and 12.8%, respectively.

In 1997 the parasite was discovered in Jayawijaya District, which is located approximately 250 km east of Paniai District. During 1991-1995, a local health center in Assologaima, Jayawijaya District reported 1120 new cases with burns and a further 293 new cases of epileptic seizures among 15,939 inhabitants. The histopathologic appearance and mitochondrial DNA analysis found the cysts to be similar to those of T. solium from other regions of the world. Sensitive and specific serological diagnostic methods were used and improved. Cysticerci were detected in dogs, as well as in pigs. A coproantigen test for detection of adult tapeworms in patients was carried out. Medical treatment with praziquantel for taeniasis and albendazole for cysticercosis (with prednisone and sodium phenytoin treatment in cases with neurocysticercosis) was undertaken. Lifestyle, religion, and socioeconomic aspects are important issues in the perpetuation and enhancing the endemicity of T. solium taeniasis and cysticercosis in Papua, Indonesia.","Margono SS, Wandra T, Swasono MF, Murni S, Craig PS, Ito A",Parasitol Int,2006,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
33149205,Effect of anthelmintic treatment on serum free IGF-1 and IGFBP-3: a cluster-randomized-controlled trial in Indonesia.,"In children, soil-transmitted helminth infections have been linked to poor nutritional status and growth retardation in association with lower levels of IGF-1. In adults, IGF-1 has an anabolic and metabolic function and is related to nutritional status. Here, we assessed the impact of helminth infection on free IGF-1 and its major binding protein, IGFBP-3, in adults. The levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP3 were measured in 1669 subjects aged >/= 16 years, before and after receiving four rounds of albendazole 400 mg/day or matching placebo for three consecutive days. Helminth infection status was assessed by microscopy (Kato-Katz) and PCR. Serum free IGF-1 level was significantly lower in helminth-infected subjects [mean difference and 95% CI - 0.068 (- 0.103; - 0.033), P < 0.001 after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, and fasting insulin level]. There was no difference in IGFBP-3 level between helminth infected versus non-infected subjects. In the whole study population, albendazole treatment significantly increased serum free IGF-1 level [estimate and 95% CI 0.031 (0.004; - 0.057), P = 0.024] whereas no effect was found on the IGFBP-3 level. Our study showed that helminth infection in adults is associated with lower free IGF-1 levels but not with IGFBP-3 and albendazole treatment significantly increases free IGF-1 levels in the study population.Clinical Trial Registration: https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN75636394 .","Kurniawan F, Tahapary DL, de Ruiter K, Yunir E, Biermasz NR, Smit JWA, Supali T, Sartono E, Yazdanbakhsh M, Soewondo P",Sci Rep,2020 Nov 4,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
21838961,"Genetic characterization of Strongyloides spp. from captive, semi-captive and wild Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) in Central and East Kalimantan, Borneo, Indonesia.","Orangutans (Pongo spp.), Asia's only great apes, are threatened in their survival due to habitat loss, hunting and infections. Nematodes of the genus Strongyloides may represent a severe cause of death in wild and captive individuals. In order to better understand which Strongyloides species/subspecies infect orangutans under different conditions, larvae were isolated from fecal material collected in Indonesia from 9 captive, 2 semi-captive and 9 wild individuals, 18 captive groups of Bornean orangutans and from 1 human working with wild orangutans. Genotyping was done at the genomic rDNA locus (part of the 18S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer 1, ITS1) by sequencing amplicons. Thirty isolates, including the one from the human, could be identified as S. fuelleborni fuelleborni with 18S rRNA gene identities of 98.5-100%, with a corresponding published sequence. The ITS1 sequences could be determined for 17 of these isolates revealing a huge variability and 2 main clusters without obvious pattern with regard to attributes of the hosts. The ITS1 amplicons of 2 isolates were cloned and sequenced, revealing considerable variability indicative of mixed infections. One isolate from a captive individual was identified as S. stercoralis (18S rRNA) and showed 99% identity (ITS1) with S. stercoralis sequences from geographically distinct locations and host species. The findings are significant with regard to the zoonotic nature of these parasites and might contribute to the conservation of remaining orangutan populations.","Labes EM, Nurcahyo W, Deplazes P, Mathis A",Parasitology,2011 Sep,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
39280328,"Prevalence and distribution of intestinal parasitic infections in taeniasis endemic area of North Sumatera, Indonesia.","A group of helminthic and intestinal protozoa causes intestinal parasitic infections (IPIs), affecting more than 2.5 billion people worldwide. IPIs are diseases closely associated with poor hygiene and sanitation, concentrated in underdeveloped regions and among populations with low socioeconomic status. Consequently, most prevalence is in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, with local habits or risk factors that could affect its prevalence. The aim of this study was to determine how hygienic practices, sanitation, and local behavior of eating raw meat (hinasumba) contributed to the prevalence of IPI. A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Simalungun District of North Sumatera Province, involving 428 people of Batak Simalungun. There were 15 villages randomly selected across the district based on the local registry, which consequently, non-purposive sampling was conducted. Face-to-face interviews assessed various risk factors, such as demographic characteristics, water source, traditional raw meat consumption, or hinasumba as local risk factors, hygienic practices, and sanitation. The findings indicated that an overall prevalence rate of IPI was 42.9%, consisting of 87.5% with helminthic infection and 12.5% with protozoal infection. More than half of IPI cases were associated with Taenia sp. infections (21.8%), followed by hookworms' infections with a 6.1% positivity rate. Based on multivariate analysis, farming and consuming traditional delicacies, namely hinasumba, increased the likelihood of IPI occurrence among the population by 1.7 and 3 times, respectively. It can be concluded that the high prevalence of taeniasis in the study area was associated with local behavior and hinasumba consumption, which may contribute to determining the dominance of specific IPI species.","Yulfi H, Darlan DM, Panggabean M, Andriyani Y, Rozi MF, Wandra T",Narra J,2024 Aug,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
24450957,Epidemiology and genetic diversity of Taenia asiatica: a systematic review.,"Taenia asiatica has made a remarkable journey through the scientific literature of the past 50 years, starting with the paradoxical observation of high prevalences of T. saginata-like tapeworms in non-beef consuming populations, to the full description of its mitochondrial genome. Experimental studies conducted in the 1980s and 1990s have made it clear that the life cycle of T. asiatica is comparable to that of T. saginata, except for pigs being the preferential intermediate host and liver the preferential location of the cysts. Whether or not T. asiatica can cause human cysticercosis, as is the case for Taenia solium, remains unclear. Given the specific conditions needed to complete its life cycle, in particular the consumption of raw or poorly cooked pig liver, the transmission of T. asiatica shows an important ethno-geographical association. So far, T. asiatica has been identified in Taiwan, South Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, south-central China, Vietnam, Japan and Nepal. Especially this last observation indicates that its distribution is not restricted to South-East-Asia, as was thought so far. Indeed, the molecular tools developed over the last 20 years have made it increasingly possible to differentiate T. asiatica from other taeniids. Such tools also indicated that T. asiatica is related more closely to T. saginata than to T. solium, feeding the debate on its taxonomic status as a separate species versus a subspecies of T. saginata. Furthermore, the genetic diversity within T. asiatica appears to be very minimal, indicating that this parasite may be on the verge of extinction. However, recent studies have identified potential hybrids between T. asiatica and T. saginata, reopening the debate on the genetic diversity of T. asiatica and its status as a separate species.","Ale A, Victor B, Praet N, Gabriel S, Speybroeck N, Dorny P, Devleesschauwer B",Parasit Vectors,2014 Jan 22,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
35445647,Immunolocalization and functional analysis of Opisthorchis viverrini-M60-like-1 metallopeptidase in animal models.,"Host mucins have crucial physical roles in preventing the parasitic establishment and maturation, and also in expelling the invading parasites. However, some parasites utilize mucinase enzymes to facilitate the infection. Recently, we have identified a mucinase enzyme of the liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini, Ov-M60-like-1, which exhibits metallopeptidase activity against bovine submaxillary mucin substrate. Here, we aimed to study the localization of this enzyme in O. viverrini and the bile duct of hamsters using immunohistochemistry and functional analysis by mucin digestion in hamsters and mice tissues. The results showed that Ov-M60-like-1 was detected strongly in the tegument, tegumental cells, vitelline glands and mature eggs with miracidium. Expression in the gut, ovary and testis of the parasite was moderate while parenchyma showed slight colour intensity. In addition, the mucinase was also detected in the host biliary epithelial cells and goblet cells surrounding the worm. The mucinase assay revealed that the Ov-M60-like-1 could digest neutral mucin in the parenchyma, testis and seminal receptacle, but not the mucin in the tegument, tegumental cells and vitelline glands of the worm. The enzyme can also digest mucin in the cholangiocytes and modified the mixture type in the bile duct goblet cells of the infected hamsters, a susceptible host. In contrast, the enzyme was unable to digest neutral, acid and mixture mucin in the bile duct of the mice, a non-susceptible host. These findings indicate that Ov-M60-like-1 may have functions in both housekeeping tasks and host-parasite interactions, especially in modification of host susceptibility.","Wendo WD, Tangkawattana S, Saichua P, Ta BTT, Candra ARK, Tangkawattana P, Suttiprapa S",Parasitology,2022 Sep,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
2670375,Filariases.,"It is apparent that there are many similarities among the various filariae. Besides a common life cycle, with an arthropod vector and human hosts, there are similarities in the diseases that they produce. This clinical picture takes one of two main courses: (1) characteristic disease produced by the presence of adult nematodes in their target tissue, which distinguishes typical cases for each of the filariae, and (2) the systemic hypersensitivity reactions to the circulating microfilaria, which tend to be similar. The characteristic feature of Wuchereria bancrofti is genital disease with funiculitis and hydrocele and less often elephantiasis. For Brugia malayi it is elephantiasis of the distal leg or arm, usually leaving the knee or elbow uninvolved with normal contours. Brugia timori, restricted to just a few islands of Indonesia, produces elephantiasis similar to that of Brugia malayi, but with its characteristic descending lymphadenitis. Loa loa is best known for the Calabar swelling, or angioedema, that it produces, although other filariae can induce similar reactions. Both Loa loa and Dirofilaria tenuis cause macroscopic, subconjunctival eyeworms. Clinical disease from onchocerciasis takes four predominant forms: eye disease, lymphadenitis, subcutaneous nodules (onchocercomata), and a pruritic, hypopigmented, or hyperpigmented papular dermatitis.",Davis BR,Dermatol Clin,1989 Apr,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
20624533,Elimination of lymphatic filariasis in Southeast Asia.,"Approximately 15 million people with lymphatic filariasis (LF) live in Southeast Asia. Wuchereria bancrofti (transmitted by the Mansonia and Anopheles vectors), Brugia malayi and Brugia timori (both transmitted by Culex quinquefasciatus) are the filarial species in this region. The endemic countries are: Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and Timor-Leste, which have all agreed to eliminate transmission of the disease by 2020. The public health interventions with respect to LF are based on the 1997 World Health Assembly resolution (WHA 50.29) which recommends elimination of the disease through mass drug administration (MDA) using diethylcarbamazine (DEC) and albendazole. The drugs are generally donated and as governments contribute 60-90% of the operational costs, MDA is deemed to be comparatively inexpensive for local administrations in relation to other public health programmes. So far, elimination has been accomplished only in the People's Republic of China (P.R. China) and this achievement is therefore described here in some detail. Resurgences have occurred but they have been successfully dealt with. Historically, the endemic areas in P.R. China covered 16,514 townships (or urban sub-districts), situated in 864 counties (or cities) in 14 provinces (or autonomous regions or municipalities). The total population at risk of infection in all endemic areas of P.R. China was originally 342 million.","Sudomo M, Chayabejara S, Duong S, Hernandez L, Wu WP, Bergquist R",Adv Parasitol,2010,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
16380290,Challenges for control of taeniasis/cysticercosis in Indonesia.,"Taeniasis/cysticercosis has been reported from several provinces of Indonesia: Papua (=former Irian Jaya), Bali, North Sumatra, East Nusa Tenggara, South East Sulawesi, Lampung, North Sulawesi, Jakarta, West Kalimantan, and East Java. The highest level of endemicity of taeniasis/cysticercosis has been found in Papua. Recent surveys in Jayawijaya District of Papua in 2000 and 2001 showed that 5 of 58 local people (8.6%) harbored the adult tapeworm, Taenia solium, whereas 44 of 96 people (45.8%), 50 of 71 pigs (70.4%), and 7 of 64 local dogs (10.9%) were seropositive for T. solium cysticercosis. Current surveys in Bali and Samosir District, North Sumatra during 2002-2005 revealed that Taenia saginata taeniasis has increased in incidence whereas T. solium cysticercosis is now rather rare compared to one-two decades ago in Bali. Taenia asiatica taeniasis is still common in Samosir District. Data from other provinces of Indonesia are very limited or unavailable. Control of these diseases is not a priority in the health or veterinary services, neither at central or local government levels. However, limited efforts toward control of the diseases have been implemented such as training of health personnel, community education on disease prevention, and provision of anthelminthics. A working group for control of the disease in Indonesia and an international collaboration have been established among Ministry of Health, Indonesia; University of Indonesia; and Asahikawa Medical College, Asahikawa, Japan since 1996. Future goals include implementation of active case finding (active surveillance) and treatment of tapeworm carriers, sustainable public health education, establishment of a system to check the quality of beef/pork and determine the distribution of infected animals and strengthening of laboratory capacity. Efforts to motivate provinces and districts should be implemented in developing the strategic plan to control of the disease. Given the considerable differences in cultures, religions, levels of education, socio-economic levels, daily habits and behaviour etc., control programmes must be adapted to the local situations.","Suroso T, Margono SS, Wandra T, Ito A",Parasitol Int,2006,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
39545191,"Prevalence and risk factors associated with zoonotic gastrointestinal helminths transmitted by cats in Jabodetabek, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: Intestinal helminth infections in cats are often neglected major zoonoses spread from pets to humans worldwide. AIM: This study evaluated the prevalence and identified risk factors associated with zoonotic gastrointestinal helminth infections in different cat populations in the most populous megapolitan areas of Indonesia: Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, and Bekasi (Jabodetabek). METHODS: Fecal samples from the shelter (stray) and household (owned) cats were analyzed using sugar flotation techniques. Intestinal helminth eggs were detected microscopically based on structural and morphometric characteristics. Risk factors for the occurrence of helminth infection were identified through statistical analysis of cat ownership, breed, migrant status, management practices, caging, feed type, and deworming medications used. Human cases of worm larvae infestation identified during the interviews were reported. RESULTS: Analysis of 354 fecal samples revealed that 37.9% (134/354) of examined cats were infected with Toxocara sp., 22.6% (80/354) with Ancylostoma sp., 25.4% (90/354) with Uncinaria sp., 3.1% (11/354) with Strongyloides sp., 2% (7/354) with Diphyllobothrium sp., and 0.6% (2/354) with Dipylidium sp. Infection with roundworms and hookworms was associated with a variety of factors, including introduction of new animals, management practices, cage cleanliness, feed type, use of deworming medication, routine deworming, and contact with other animals. A human case of cutaneous larva migrans was due to hookworm (Ancylostoma sp./Uncinaria sp.) infection. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of important zoonotic gastrointestinal nematodes (hookworms and roundworms) is high in cats in Jabodetabek, Indonesia. To reduce the risk of transmission to other animals or humans, adequate measures to control, manage, and prevent zoonotic helminth infections are required. This study presents important baseline information that provides a basis for future epidemiologic studies and the development of strategies to manage zoonotic gastrointestinal helminths in cats in the region.","Sawitri DH, Wardhana AH, Nefho F, Purwanto ES, Endrawati D, Nugraheni YR, Primatika RA, Damayanti NA, Akbari RA, Kusumaningtyas E, Matsubayashi M",Open Vet J,2024 Oct,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia

17547058,"Towards the international collaboration for detection, surveillance and control of taeniasis/ cysticercosis and echinococcosis in Asia and the Pacific.","Both cysticercosis and echinococcosis are potentially among the most serious helminth zoonoses threatening human health worldwide. However, due to the lack of reliable tools for confirmation or identification of patients or infected animals, epidemiological data are expected to be underestimated. Conversely, sometimes, such data are over estimated due to the lack of specificity. The most important issue for doing field surveys is that they use evidence based science. In this communication, advanced immunological and molecular tools for detection of individuals infected with either metacestodes or adult tapeworms are briefly overviewed, and the applications of such tools for epidemiological surveys in Indonesia, China and other countries are introduced. As immunological tools are based on antigen-antibody responses, there may exist some cross-reactions. Therefore, immunodiagnostic tools are expected to be useful for primary screening, and should be combined with confirmation of direct parasitological evidence (morphology or DNA), and imaging techniques for cysts. As a risk factor for human cysticercosis is the presence of tapeworm carriers, detection of taeniasis cases and differentiation of the three human Taenia species (Taenia solium, T. saginata and T. asiatica) in Asia and the Pacific requires consideration. Similarly, in northwest China, Echinococcus granulosus and E. multilocularis are coendemic and differentiation of these species is required in humans and definitive hosts. It is stressed that combination of several tools for identification of the parasite and for confirmation of diseases is important for obtaining highly reliable data before consideration of control of these zoonoses. Recent projects coordinated by Asahikawa Medical College have concentrated on immunological and molecular diagnostic techniques transferable to colleagues from endemic regions of Asia and the Pacific, and on organization of two international symposia to establish a platform for further collaboration in the future.","Ito A, Wandra T, Sato MO, Mamuti W, Xiao N, Sako Y, Nakao M, Yamasaki H, Nakaya K, Okamoto M, Craig PS",Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health,2006,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia

There were 1-5 segments which can move actively discharge per day. Although he feels embarrassed about the condition, no significant symptoms were found, and physical examination was within normal limits. Clinical diagnosis of Taeniasis was made on October 20, 2017, and subsequently received oral Praziquantel 600 mg tablet single dose and 5 mg of oral Bisacodyl. Four hours later, the patient was defecated. The stool was collected in plastic and filtered with a filter device to collect any tapeworm segments.A full segment of tapeworm as long as 2.86 meters were found. Microscopic examination was done to identify the egg worms, proglottids, and scolex. Dye substance was injected into a mature gravid proglottid through the genital pore and pressed in two object-glasses to identify the reproductive organs. Microscopic examination (400x magnification) of this sample revealed that the number of uterine branches and testes in a proglottid were 16 pairs. The number of uterine branches in T. solium are 8-12 pairs and T. saginata are 18-32 pairs.The filtered stool was moved into a container and carefully observed. A soft yellowish-white material of 1.5 mm in diameter was found, which turned out to be the head of the tapeworm called Scolex. Microscopic examination of scolex revealed that the rostellum was absent. A segment called 'snout' was found at the apex. The functions were probably as a sense of smell and vacuum organ.The patient was lived in Simalungun, North Sumatera, some tribe in that area has a long tradition of culinary called 'Hinasumba', consist of raw pork liver and meat, and 'Naiholat' consist of poorly cooked pork.Even though pig was determined as an intermediate host, the type of tapeworm was not consistent with T.solium. The patient had the long history of infection but never had sign or symptoms of neurocystecercosis. Based on etno-geographical condition, the patient was infected by T.asiatica. Microscopic examination of the uterus and scolex indicate that the tapeworm had most similarity to T.asiatica.Amin et al.8 from Bangladesh in 2009 reported a case of T. asiatica in human with total strobila length was 1.5 meters. Macroscopic morphology (length:width) of gravid proglottid segment of T.saginata is 3:1, T. solium 1.5:1. The tapeworm that we discovered had 1-1.5:1 ratio (2.5 cm length and 2 cm width).Some features of the tapeworm (no rostellum, present of the snout, and fix number of theuterus in every proglottid) were not found in three existing type of Taenia species.

30560772,"Comparison of the Impact of Annual and Semiannual Mass Drug Administration on Lymphatic Filariasis Prevalence in Flores Island, Indonesia.","We compared the impact of annual and semiannual mass drug administration (MDA) on the prevalence of Brugia timori and Wuchereria bancrofti in Flores Island. Two villages (Paga, B. timori only; Lewomada, co-endemic) received annual MDA with diethylcarbamazine/albendazole and a larger village (Pruda, co-endemic) received semiannual MDA. Infection parameters (microfilariae [Mf], antibodies to recombinant filarial antigen BmR1 [Brugia Rapid (BR)], and a test for W. bancrofti antigenemia [immunochromatographic test (ICT)]) were assessed before and after treatment. The crude Mf prevalence in Pruda decreased after five semiannual treatments from 14.2% to 1.2%, whereas the Mf prevalence in the other two villages decreased after three annual treatments from 3.9% to 0% and from 5% to 0.3%, respectively. ICT positivity prevalence in Pruda and Lewomada decreased from 22.9% and 6.5% to 7% and 0.8%, respectively, whereas BR antibody prevalence in Pruda, Lewomada, and Paga decreased from 28.9%, 31.7%, and 12.5% to 3.6%, 4.1%, and 1.8%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis indicated that that Mf, BR, and ICT prevalence decreased significantly over time and that for the Mf and ICT outcomes the semiannual treatment had higher odds of positivity. Model-adjusted prevalence estimates revealed that apparent differences in treatment effectiveness were driven by differences in baseline prevalence and that adjusted prevalence declined more rapidly in the semiannual treatment group. We conclude that in this setting, annual MDA was sufficient to reduce Mf prevalence to less than 1% in areas with low to moderate baseline prevalence. Semiannual MDA was useful for rapidly reducing Mf prevalence in an area with higher baseline endemicity.","Supali T, Djuardi Y, Lomiga A, Nur Linda S, Iskandar E, Goss CW, Miller JP, Weil GJ, Fischer PU",Am J Trop Med Hyg,2019 Feb,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
38720371,Prevalence estimates of Opisthorchis viverrini and Clonorchis sinensis infection in the Greater Mekong subregion: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Opisthorchiasis and clonorchiasis, caused by Opisthorchis viverrini and Clonorchis sinensis, respectively, are significant yet neglected foodborne trematodiases in the Great Mekong Subregion (GMS). Despite the reporting of the prevalence of these human liver flukes in the region over the past decades, there has been a lack of a comprehensive and systematic consolidation of this data. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a thorough systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize and analyze time-trend prevalence estimates of both O. viverrini and C. sinensis across the GMS for the past 30 years. METHODS: This study undertakes a systematic review using a comprehensive search for published articles in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane and Thai Journal Online databases until early 2023. The pooled prevalence of O. viverrini and C. sinensis infection was analyzed through a random-effects meta-analysis, with meta-regression analysis used to quantify associations with study characteristics. Sub-group analysis was conducted, whenever comparison data were available, to assess the risk of O. viverrini and C. sinensis infection in each GMS country. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the Q statistic and quantified by using the I (2) Index. RESULTS: From a total of 2997 articles, 155 articles comprising 218 datasets and 751,108 participants were included for review. The GMS prevalence of O. viverrini was 21.11% [45,083/260,237; 95% confidence interval (CI): 17.74-24.47%]. Pooled prevalence estimates were highly observed in Laos (34.06%, 95% CI: 26.85-41.26%), followed by Thailand (18.19%, 95% CI: 13.86-22.51%), and Cambodia (10.48%, 95% CI: 5.52-15.45%). Myanmar and Vietnam had limited data sources for calculation. Clonorchis sinensis infection in GMS was 25.33% (95% CI: 18.32-32.34%), with Guangxi, China, exhibiting the highest prevalence rates at 26.89% (95% CI: 18.34-35.43%), while Vietnam had a prevalence rate of 20.30% (95% CI: 9.13-31.47%). O. viverrini prevalence decreased significantly over time, whereas C. sinensis infection appeared to be stable consistently over time in both China and Vietnam. CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive study, drawing from the largest datasets to date, offers an in-depth systematic prevalence review of human liver flukes in the Greater Mekong Subregion. It underscores the imperative for systematic surveillance, data collection, and the implementation of intervention and control measures for these infectious diseases of poverty.","Sota P, Andityas M, Kotepui M, Sripa B",Infect Dis Poverty,2024 May 8,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
26168919,A comparison of two tests for filarial antigenemia in areas in Sri Lanka and Indonesia with low-level persistence of lymphatic filariasis following mass drug administration.,"BACKGROUND: Filarial antigen tests are key tools for mapping the distribution of bancroftian filariasis and for detecting areas with persistent infections following mass drug administration (MDA). A recent study showed that the new Alere Filariasis Test Strip (FTS) has better analytical sensitivity than the BinaxNOW Filariasis card test (Card Test) for detecting circulating filarial antigen, and the FTS detected more positive results than the Card Test in a field study performed in a highly endemic area in Liberia. METHODS: The present study compared the performance of the FTS and the Card Test in community surveys that were conducted in southern Sri Lanka and in Indonesia (Central Java) in areas with low-level persistence of LF following multiple rounds of MDA with diethylcarbamazine plus albendazole. The studies were performed in densely populated semi-urban areas where Wuchereria bancrofti is transmitted by Culex quinquefasciatus. RESULTS: Antigenemia rates by FTS were 138% higher in the Sri Lanka study (43/852 vs. 18/852) and 21% higher in the Indonesia study (50/778 vs. 41/778) than antigenemia rates by Card Test. Antigenemia rates were significantly higher in males than in females and higher in adults than in children in both study sites. Although overall antigenemia rates and test scores were significantly higher by FTS than by Card Test in both study areas, rates in young children were similar with both tests in both areas. CONCLUSIONS: These results extend the previously reported superior sensitivity of the FTS to areas with low residual infection rates following MDA, and this could affect mapping and post-MDA survey results in adults. However, our findings suggest that results of transmission assessment surveys (TAS) performed in school-aged children are likely to be similar with both tests.","Yahathugoda TC, Supali T, Rao RU, Djuardi Y, Stefani D, Pical F, Fischer PU, Lloyd MM, Premaratne PH, Weerasooriya MV, Weil GJ",Parasit Vectors,2015 Jul 15,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
27791067,Community deworming alleviates geohelminth-induced immune hyporesponsiveness.,"In cross-sectional studies, chronic helminth infections have been associated with immunological hyporesponsiveness that can affect responses to unrelated antigens. To study the immunological effects of deworming, we conducted a cluster-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Indonesia and assigned 954 households to receive albendazole or placebo once every 3 mo for 2 y. Helminth-specific and nonspecific whole-blood cytokine responses were assessed in 1,059 subjects of all ages, whereas phenotyping of regulatory molecules was undertaken in 121 school-aged children. All measurements were performed before and at 9 and 21 mo after initiation of treatment. Anthelmintic treatment resulted in significant increases in proinflammatory cytokine responses to Plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells (PfRBCs) and mitogen, with the largest effect on TNF responses to PfRBCs at 9 mo-estimate [95% confidence interval], 0.37 [0.21-0.53], P value over time (P(time)) < 0.0001. Although the frequency of regulatory T cells did not change after treatment, there was a significant decline in the expression of the inhibitory molecule cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) on CD4(+) T cells of albendazole-treated individuals, -0.060 [-0.107 to -0.013] and -0.057 [-0.105 to -0.008] at 9 and 21 mo, respectively; P(time) = 0.017. This trial shows the capacity of helminths to up-regulate inhibitory molecules and to suppress proinflammatory immune responses in humans. This could help to explain the inferior immunological responses to vaccines and lower prevalence of inflammatory diseases in low- compared with high-income countries.","Wammes LJ, Hamid F, Wiria AE, May L, Kaisar MM, Prasetyani-Gieseler MA, Djuardi Y, Wibowo H, Kruize YC, Verweij JJ, de Jong SE, Tsonaka R, Houwing-Duistermaat JJ, Sartono E, Luty AJ, Supali T, Yazdanbakhsh M",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,2016 Nov 1,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia

36654068,"Schistosomiasis model with treatment, habitat modification and biological control.","Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma worm infection. Some species of snails can serve as the intermediate hosts for the parasite. Numerous interventions have been performed to repress the snail population. One of them is the use of molluscicide. Nevertheless, it is debated that molluscicide intervention has negative impacts on the ecosystem. To investigate the impact of more environmentally friendly interventions, we develop a schistosomiasis model with treatment, habitat modification and biological control. The biological control agent examined in our model is a snail predator. Moreover, to investigate the impact of snail habitat modification, we assume that the snail population grows logistically. We show that all solutions of our model are non-negative and bounded. We also study the existence and stability conditions of equilibrium points. The basic reproduction numbers are determined using the next-generation operator. Linearization combined with the Routh-Hurwitz criterion is used to prove the local stability condition of disease-free equilibrium points. Bifurcation theory is applied to investigate the local stability condition of the endemic equilibrium points. To examine the global behavior of our model, we use asymptotically autonomous system theory and construct a Lyapunov function. We perform several numerical simulations to validate and support our deductive results. Our results show that early treatment can reduce the basic reproduction number and schistosomiasis cases. In addition, modifying snail habitat and releasing the snail predator at the snail habitat can reduce schistosomiasis prevalence. We suggest using snail predators which can hunt and kill snails effectively as a biological control agent.","Nur W, Trisilowati T, Suryanto A, Kusumawinahyu WM",Math Biosci Eng,2022 Sep 19,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
32505594,"Epidemiology and risk factors of Strongyloides stercoralis infection in Papua, Indonesia: a molecular diagnostic study.","Strongyloides stercoralis is a parasitic worm that is of considerable clinical relevance. Indeed, it may persist asymptomatically for many years, but can lead to potentially fatal dissemination when the host's immune status is impaired. As commonly employed stool microscopy techniques (e.g. Kato-Katz thick smear) fail to detect S. stercoralis, the epidemiology is poorly understood. In 2013, we conducted a cross-sectional household survey in the district of Mimika in Papua, Indonesia. A total of 331 individuals, aged 1 month to 44 years, had a single stool sample subjected to real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for S. stercoralis diagnosis. The prevalence of S. stercoralis infection was 32.0% (106/331 individuals); higher than any of the three main soil-transmitted helminths (Ascaris lumbricoides, 23.9%; Trichuris trichiura, 18.4%; and hookworm, 17.2%). Amongst the S. stercoralis-infected individuals, 73.6% were concurrently infected with another helminth, with hookworm being the most frequent co-infection (27.4%). Fourteen percent of the S. stercoralis infections had low cycle threshold values on real-time PCR, which may indicate a higher infection intensity. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age >/=5 years (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 5.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.1-10.8) was significantly associated with S. stercoralis infection. There is a need for in-depth clinical and diagnostic studies to elucidate the public health impact of S. stercoralis infection in Indonesia.","Kridaningsih TN, Sukmana DJ, Mufidah H, Diptyanusa A, Kusumasari RA, Burdam FH, Kenangalem E, Poespoprodjo JR, Fuad A, Mahendradhata Y, Supargiyono S, Utzinger J, Becker SL, Murhandarwati EEH",Acta Trop,2020 Sep,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia

Samples of saliva from 22 individuals with alveococcosis were included in the research. Biological fluid samples were taken at the time of admission and before the patient was discharged. Following that, slides were made utilizing the teziocrystalloscopy method, which incorporates the investigation of the crystal forming activity of mixed saliva with its starting characteristics using a 0.9 percent sodium chloride solution as the foundation ingredient. Using our own set of criteria, we evaluated the outcomes of crystalloscopic and tezigraphic experiments. Specrophotometric examination of tezigraphic and crystalloscopic facies was done using a PowerWave XS microplate spectrophotometer at wavelengths of 400, 350, and 300 nm to augment the results from ocular morphometry of dried saliva micro slides. Surgical therapy results in a partial normalization of physical and chemical parameters, as well as the composition of the patient's biological fluids after the patient is discharged from the hospital.","Widjaja G, Younus LA, Abdelbasset WK, Ibragimov DD, Yumashev AV, Shalaby MN, Mustafa YF, Fardeeva I",Braz J Biol,2022,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
30385216,Towards a cysticercosis-free tropical resort island: A historical overview of taeniasis/cysticercosis in Bali.,"Taeniasis and cysticercosis are known to be endemic in several Indonesian islands, although relatively little recent epidemiological data are available. As most Indonesian people are Muslims, taeniasis/cysticercosis caused by the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium, has a restricted presence in non-Muslim societies and is endemic only among some Hindu communities on the island of Bali. Bali has long been known to be endemic for taeniasis/cysticercosis; almost a century ago levels of cysticercosis of 20-30% were described in cattle and 2-3% in pigs. Few studies of taeniasis/cysticercosis were undertaken in Bali prior to a series of research programs commenced since the 1990s. Both Taenia saginata and T. solium continue to be endemic in Bali. Molecular studies have revealed that all T. saginata-like tapeworms detected in Bali are T. saginata. No evidence has been found for the presence of Taenia asiatica in Bali. Economic, sanitary and education improvements across much of the island over the past decades have been associated with a decline in the amount of transmission of T. solium such that the parasite now seems to be restricted to the eastern part of the island, a small area on the northeastern slope of Mt. Agung, the highest mountain in Bali. The living environment including sanitation and hygiene condition in this endemic area remains relatively poor especially during the half-year dry season, and pigs continue to roam freely. In this review, historical records and ongoing projects towards elimination of taeniasis/cysticercosis in Bali are reviewed to provide a better understanding of the present situation of taeniasis/cysticercosis in Bali towards a future, cysticercosis-free tropical resort island.","Sutisna P, Kapti IN, Wandra T, Dharmawan NS, Swastika K, Raka Sudewi AA, Susilawathi NM, Sudarmaja IM, Yanagida T, Okamoto M, Yoshida T, Donadeu M, Lightowlers MW, Ito A",Acta Trop,2019 Feb,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
34752782,The burden of opisthorchiasis and leptospirosis in Thailand: A nationwide syndemic analysis.,"Opisthorchiasis, caused by the foodborne trematode parasite Opisthorchis viverrini, is co-endemic with leptospirosis in the Greater Mekong Subregion. Socio-economic determinants, occupational risk factors, and reservoir hosts interact with the diseases in the threat to human health, but the situation has not been explored. We, therefore, studied the interaction between the diseases and their associated risks using a syndemic approach with nationwide data for Thailand. Methods included Bayesian mapping, principal component analysis (PCA), and nested correlation analysis to analyze the data for 2009 and 2014. Bayesian mapping demonstrates that opisthorchiasis acts in a synergistic manner to massively alter the risk of leptospirosis at the provincial level, particularly in areas of opisthorchiasis endemicity in Northeast Thailand. Socio-economic and occupational factors significantly influence the disease syndemic with moderate effect sizes of -0.4 and 0.5, respectively (P<0.001). These effects are most remarkable in the northeastern region, which has not only the highest poverty level but also the highest proportion of occupational risk (P<0.001). Cats and dogs play crucial roles in maintaining the syndemic (r-value 7 and 6 with P<0.001). The study shows that opisthorchiasis and leptospirosis become syndemic, especially in North-East, Thailand. Socio-economic and occupational variables are positively syndemic as they are representative of neglected tropical diseases. The role of reservoir hosts underlines the value of an interdisciplinary approach, such as One Health for Sustainability Disease Control.","Almanfaluthi M, Widodo S, Suttiprapa S, Wongsaroj T, Sripa B",Acta Trop,2022 Feb,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
8923144,Approaches to the control of fasciolosis in ruminants.,"Approaches to the control of fasciolosis in ruminants are compared for developed countries, and for developing countries with particular reference to regions growing irrigated rice. In all environments problem definition and investigation are based on one or more of observation, abattoir surveys, faecal egg counts, tracer animals and snail studies. In developed countries each husbandman grazes a large number of animals, controls access to pasture and water, and markets high value products. Strategic and tactical treatments control fasciolosis in these circumstances and will continue to do so while anthelmintics remain effective. In many developing countries subsistence families possess small numbers of animals, feed and water sources are shared by many families, and the products are mainly draft power, fertiliser and meat for local consumption. Consequently the agricultural cycle, and the life cycles of the parasite and intermediate host, are closely interrelated and there is some scope for controlling infection by modifying husbandry practices. Anthelmintics are not affordable. Recent observations of a major fasciola resistance gene with substantial dominance, in Indonesian Thin Tail sheep infected with Fasciola gigantica, suggest that parasite control by breed substitution, or cross-breeding and selection, is feasible. Such control would be inexpensive to implement, and sustainable.","Roberts JA, Suhardono",Int J Parasitol,1996 Aug-Sep,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
23129304,Helminth infection in populations undergoing epidemiological transition: a friend or foe?,"Helminth infections are highly prevalent in developing countries, especially in rural areas. With gradual development, there is a transition from living conditions that are dominated by infection, poor sanitation, manual labor, and traditional diet to a situation where burden of infections is reduced, infrastructure is improved, sedentary lifestyle dominates, and processed food forms a large proportion of the calorie intake. The combinations of some of the changes in lifestyle and environment are expected to result in alteration of the landscape of diseases, which will become dominated by non-communicable disorders. Here we review how the major helminth infections affect a large proportion of the population in the developing world and discuss their impact on the immune system and the consequences of this for other infections which are co-endemic in the same areas. Furthermore, we address the issue of decreasing helminth infections in many parts of the world within the context of increasing inflammatory, metabolic, and cardiovascular diseases.","Wiria AE, Djuardi Y, Supali T, Sartono E, Yazdanbakhsh M",Semin Immunopathol,2012 Nov,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
36736992,First bovine vaccine to prevent human schistosomiasis - a cluster randomised Phase 3 clinical trial.,"OBJECTIVE: Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical parasitic disease caused by blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma. Schistosoma japonicum is zoonotic in China, the Philippines, and Indonesia, with bovines acting as major reservoirs of human infection. The primary objective of the trial was to examine the impact of a combination of human mass chemotherapy, snail control through mollusciciding, and SjCTPI bovine vaccination on the rate of human infection. METHODS: A 5-year phase IIIa cluster randomized control trial was conducted among 18 schistosomiasis-endemic villages comprising 18,221 residents in Northern Samar, The Philippines. RESULTS: Overall, bovine vaccination resulted in a statistically significant decrease in human infection (relative risk [RR] = 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.69 to 0.82) across all trial follow-ups. The best outcome of the trial was when bovine vaccination was combined with snail mollusciciding. This combination resulted in a 31% reduction (RR = 0.69; 95% CI = 0.61 to 0.78) in human infection. CONCLUSION: This is the first trial to demonstrate the effectiveness of a bovine vaccine for schistosomiasis in reducing human schistosome infection.

BACKGROUND: Chronic helminth infection, which can lead to poor nutritional status and anti-inflammatory response, might protect against the development of atherosclerosis. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed in Flores, Indonesia, an area highly endemic for soil-transmitted helminths (STH). Stool samples from 675 participants aged 18-80 years were collected and screened for Trichuris trichiura by microscopy and for Ascaris lumbricoides, Necator americanus, Ancylostoma duodenale, and Strongyloides stercoralis by qPCR. We collected data on body mass index (BMI), waist to hip ratio (WHR), blood pressure, fasting blood glucose (FBG), lipid, high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), total immunoglobulin-E (TIgE) and Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide stimulated cytokines (tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-10). In a subset of 301 elderly adults (>/=40 years of age) carotid intima media thickness (cIMT) was measured. RESULTS: Participants with any STH infection had lower BMI (kg/m2) (mean difference -0.66, 95%CI [-1.26, -0.06]), WHR (-0.01, [-0.02, -0.00]), total cholesterol (mmol/L) (-0.22, [-0.43, -0.01]) and LDL-cholesterol (mmol/L) (-0.20, [-0.39, -0.00]) than uninfected participants. After additional adjustment for BMI the association between helminth infection and total cholesterol (mean difference -0.17, 95%CI [-0.37, 0.03]) as well as LDL-cholesterol (-0.15, [-0.33, 0.04]) was less pronounced. BMI, WHR, and total cholesterol were negatively associated with number species of helminth co-infections. Participants with high TIgE, an indicator of exposure to helminths, had lower FBG, TC, and HDL. The association between TIgE and TC and HDL remained significant after adjustment with BMI. No clear association was found between STH infection or TIgE and mean cIMT. CONCLUSIONS: This cross-sectional study presents evidence that helminth infections were negatively associated with risk factors for cardiovascular disease, an association at least partially mediated by an effect on BMI. The significance of this finding needs to be determined.","Wiria AE, Wammes LJ, Hamid F, Dekkers OM, Prasetyani MA, May L, Kaisar MM, Verweij JJ, Tamsma JT, Partono F, Sartono E, Supali T, Yazdanbakhsh M, Smit JW",PLoS One,2013,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia

The results of the surveys were used to prepare and evaluate the social mobilization component of a pilot mass drug administration (MDA) in five villages. In the study area, the filarial parasites Brugia timori and Wuchereria bancrofti are highly endemic. Frequent and severe adverse reactions after MDA may occur especially in areas endemic for B. timori and therefore, a special communication strategy was designed to inform and to educate communities about LF and its control. The first KAP survey was conducted as a baseline pre-MDA with diethylcarbamazine and albendazole and the second as a post-intervention evaluation in order to obtain information on the impact of the communication campaign. Before the information campaign and the subsequent MDA, 54% of the study population had heard of one of the three main terms for LF, whereas after health education and MDA, 89% had heard of at least one of the three terms. Similarly, pre-MDA, 21% reported having had previously taken the treatment for filariasis, while post-MDA, 88% reported having taken the treatment during the pilot treatment period. The historical fears and traumatic experiences associated with past LF treatment campaigns in Indonesia were averted since both the communication campaign and the MDA were designed appropriately for and together with the community. As a result, compliance was sufficient in the first round to successfully begin the elimination process.","Krentel A, Fischer P, Manoempil P, Supali T, Servais G, Ruckert P",Trop Med Int Health,2006 Nov,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia

However, epidemiological data from community based studies are sparse and available only for a few countries in Asia. Cysticercosis is the cause of epilepsy in up to 50% of Indian patients presenting with partial seizures. It is also a major cause of epilepsy in Bali (Indonesia), Vietnam and possibly China and Nepal. Seroprevalence studies indicate high rates of exposure to the parasite in several countries (Vietnam, China, Korea and Bali (Indonesia)) with rates ranging from 0.02 to 12.6%. Rates of taeniosis, as determined by stool examination for ova, have also been reported to range between 0.1 and 6% in the community in India, Vietnam, China, and Bali (Indonesia). An astonishingly high rate of taeniosis of 50% was reported from an area in Nepal populated by pig rearing farmers. In addition to poor sanitation, unhealthy pig rearing practices, low hygienic standards, unusual customs such as consumption of raw pork is an additional factor contributing to the spread of the disease in some communities of Asia. Undoubtedly, cysticercosis is a major public health problem in several Asian countries effecting several million people by not only causing neurological morbidity but also imposing economic hardship on impoverished populations. However, there are wide variations in the prevalence rates in different regions and different socio-economic groups in the same country. It is important to press for the recognition of cysticercosis as one of the major public health problems in Asia that needs to be tackled vigorously by the governments and public health authorities of the region.","Rajshekhar V, Joshi DD, Doanh NQ, van De N, Xiaonong Z",Acta Trop,2003 Jun,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
33790353,Genetic characterization of nodular worm infections in Asian Apes.,"Parasitic nematodes of Oesophagostomum spp., commonly known, as 'nodular worms' are emerging as the most widely distributed and prevalent zoonotic nematodes. Oesophagostomum infections are well documented in African non-human primates; however, the taxonomy, distribution and transmission of Oesophagostomum in Asian non-human primates are not adequately studied. To better understand which Oesophagostomum species infect Asian non-human primates and determine their phylogeny we analysed 55 faecal samples from 50 orangutan and 5 gibbon individuals from Borneo and Sumatra. Both microscopy and molecular results revealed that semi-wild animals had higher Oesophagostomum infection prevalence than free ranging animals. Based on sequence genotyping analysis targeting the Internal transcribed spacer 2 of rDNA, we report for the first time the presence of O. aculeatum in Sumatran apes. Population genetic analysis shows that there is significant genetic differentiation between Bornean and Sumatran O. aculeatum populations. Our results clearly reveal that O. aculeatum in free-ranging animals have a higher genetic variation than those in semi-wild animals, demonstrating that O. aculeatum is circulating naturally in wildlife and zoonotic transmission is possible. Further studies should be conducted to better understand the epidemiology and dynamics of Oesophagostomum transmission between humans, non-human primates and other wild species and livestock in Southeast Asia.","Yalcindag E, Stuart P, Hasegawa H, Streit A, Dolezalova J, Morrogh-Bernard H, Cheyne SM, Nurcahyo W, Foitova I",Sci Rep,2021 Mar 31,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia

We aimed to identify factors influencing infection risk for specific intestinal parasites in wild orangutans and individuals living in captivity. Various genera of Protozoa (including Entamoeba, Endolimax, Iodamoeba, Balantidium, Giardia and Blastocystis), nematodes (such as Strongyloides, Trichuris, Ascaris, Enterobius, Trichostrongylus and hookworms) and one trematode (a dicrocoeliid) were identified. For the first time, the cestode Hymenolepis was detected in orangutans. Highest prevalences were found for Strongyloides (individuals 37%; groups 58%), hookworms (41%; 58%), Balantidium (40%; 61%), Entamoeba coli (29%; 53%) and a trichostrongylid (13%; 32%). In re-introduction centres, infants were at higher risk of infection with Strongyloides than adults. Infection risk for hookworms was significantly higher in wild males compared with females. In groups, the centres themselves had a significant influence on the infection risk for Balantidium. Ranging patterns of wild orangutans, overcrowding in captivity and a shift of age composition in favour of immatures seemed to be the most likely factors leading to these results.","Labes EM, Hegglin D, Grimm F, Nurcahyo W, Harrison ME, Bastian ML, Deplazes P",Parasitology,2010 Jan,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia

PCR-based assays to detect parasite DNA, in addition to assays for detecting specific antibodies that have been originally developed for B. malayi, can be used efficiently as diagnostic tools for B. timori. In the framework of the Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis, a single annual dose of diethylcarbamazine, in combination with albendazole, was found to reduce the prevalence and density of microfilaraemia persistently.

Worm nests were detected in 4 of 32 patients in India and Indonesia, located in the breast, the thigh, the calf and an inguinal lymph node. The study shows that adult filariae of B. malayi in humans can be detected by USG, but the technique is limited by the fact that worm nests seem not to be stable over time in humans, as is the case in bancroftian filariasis.","Mand S, Supali T, Djuardi J, Kar S, Ravindran B, Hoerauf A",Trop Med Int Health,2006 Sep,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
19238666,Echinococcosis and cysticercosis in Asia: evaluation of the modern technology for epidemiological study.,"The recent emergence of zoonotic parasitic diseases of public health importance represents a growing global concern. Among zoonotic helminthic diseases, both echinococcosis and cysticercosis are the most serious diseases threatening human life. Neurocysticercosis (NCC) caused by ingestion of eggs of the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium, is spreading worldwide and not rare even in Muslim or Jewish communities. Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) caused by the proliferation of metacestodes of the fox tapeworm, Echinococcus multilocularis, is the most potentially lethal parasitic infection of the non-tropical northern hemisphere, whereas cystic echinococcosis (CE) caused by the proliferation of metacestodes of the dog tapeworm, E. granulosus, has rather a cosmopolitan distribution. As the life cycles of T. solium, E. multilocularis and E. granulosus are completed through predator-prey interactions, including humans, it is crucial to interrupt the cycle for control of these zoonotic cestodiases. Both NCC and CE are expected to be eradicable, since the principal life cycles of T. solium and E. granulosus are maintained between humans and pigs and between dogs and herbivorous domestic animals, respectively. In contrast, AE is perhaps not eradicable, since the life cycle of E. multilocularis is maintained between wild foxes and rodents. Modern technologies, including imaging, immunology and molecular biology, have been applied for epidemiological surveys. In the present review, we introduce such technologies applied in Japan, China and Indonesia, and point out the problems that need to be solved for control of these three zoonotic cestodiases.","Ito A, Yamasaki H, Nakao M, Sako Y, Nakaya K, Mamuti W, Xiao N, Sato MO, Ishikawa Y",Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health,2003,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
38011734,"Surveillance and Selective Treatment of Brugia malayi Filariasis Eleven Years after Stopping Mass Drug Administration in Belitung District, Indonesia.","Brugia malayi is the major cause of lymphatic filariasis (LF) in Indonesia. Zoophilic B. malayi was endemic in Belitung district, and mass drug administration (MDA) with diethylcarbamazine (DEC) and albendazole ceased after five annual rounds in 2010. The district passed three transmission assessment surveys (TAS) between 2011 and 2016. As part of the post-TAS3 surveillance of the national LF elimination program, we collected night blood samples for microfilaria (Mf) detection from 1,911 subjects more than 5 years of age in seven villages. A B. malayi Mf prevalence ranging from 1.7% to 5.9% was detected in five villages. Only 2 (5%) of the total 40 Mf-positive subjects were adolescents aged 18 and 19 years old, and 38 (95%) Mf-positive subjects were 21 years and older. Microfilarial densities in infected individuals were mostly low, with 60% of the subjects having Mf densities between 16 and 160 Mf/mL. Triple-drug treatment with ivermectin, DEC, and albendazole (IDA) was given to 36 eligible Mf-positive subjects. Adverse events were mostly mild, and treatment was well tolerated. One year later, 35 of the treated Mf-positive subjects were reexamined, and 33 (94%) had cleared all Mf, while the anti-Bm14 antibody prevalence remained almost unchanged. Results indicate that in B. malayi-endemic areas, post-TAS3 surveillance for Mf in the community may be needed to detect a potential parasite reservoir in adults. Selective treatment with IDA is highly effective in clearing B. malayi Mf and should be used to increase the prospects for LF elimination if MDA is reintroduced.","Supali T, Djuardi Y, Sianipar LR, Suryaningtyas NH, Alfian R, Destani Y, Iskandar E, Astuty H, Sugianto N, Fischer PU",Am J Trop Med Hyg,2024 Jan 3,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia

The questionnaire dealt with life style and sanitary conditions. In 482 houses in the 4 villages, interviews for the items of the questionnaire were conducted with the owner, housekeeper and children of the same family. In Pancana and Lalolang, 37.7% and 50% respectively of man inhabitants surveyed were fishermen, while in Lompo Riaja and Pattappa, 38.6% and 65.5% respectively were farmers. The highest proportion of official workers was 33.7% in Lompo Riaja. Educational level was low; 88.4% in Pancana, 90.4% in Lalolang, 62.1% in Lompo Riaja and 91.2% in Pattappa had elementary or below elementary school education. In Lompo Riaja, 30.8% of the inhabitants graduated from senior high school or university. The percentage of families having their own latrine was 30.3% in Pancana, 13.2% in Lalolang, 31.9% in Pattapa and 60% in Lompo Riaja. The people without latrines usually defecated in rice fields, seaside or riverside. A total of 654 fecal samples was examined by the modified Kato-Katz thick smear method. Five nematode species, Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, Necator americanus, Strongyloides stercoralis and unidentified Rhabditoids of free-living nature were detected. Cestode, Hymenolepis nana infection was confirmed. All the hookworms examined by the modified Harada-Mori culture technic were Necator americanus. Trichuris infection was most common, followed by hookworm and Ascaris infections, both in young (aged 4-14) and older (aged over 15) age groups. The prevalence of hookworm infection was significantly higher in males than in females of older age. Among the older age group, the prevalence of Trichuris infection was significantly lower in Lompo Riaja, while hookworm infection was the highest in Pattappa. Among all the inhabitants examined for parasite infection, 17.4% had 3 kinds of nematode, Ascaris, Trichuris and hookworm. However, egg counts revealed that most of the inhabitants with Trichuris or hookworm had light infections. The inhabitants with higher education background had significantly lower infection rates of Ascaris and Trichuris. The prevalence of hookworm infection was not significantly different between the inhabitants owning latrine and without it, but the prevalence of Ascaris and Trichuris, differed significantly.","Toma A, Miyagi I, Kamimura K, Tokuyama Y, Hasegawa H, Selomo M, Dahlan D, Majid I, Hasanuddi I, Ngatimin R, Mogi M, Kuwabara N",Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health,1999 Mar,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia

In total, 398 local people from 247 families were diagnosed by anamnesis and clinical examinations, and 60 residents were suspected to be taeniasis carriers. Among 60 suspected carriers, 56 persons expelled a total of 61 taeniid adult worms after praziquantel treatment. From 398 residents, 252 stool samples were available for analysis of taeniid eggs, coproantigens or copro-DNA for identification of taeniid species, and 311 serum samples were available for detection of antibodies against Taenia solium cysticercosis. Taeniasis prevalences were highly variable among three villages (1.1-27.5%), and only one case of cysticercosis due to T. solium infection was detected. All expelled tapeworms were confirmed to be Taenia saginata by mtDNA analysis. There was no Taenia asiatica human case in Bali. Case control analysis of 106 families chosen at random from 179 families in 2004 and another 106 families from non-endemic areas revealed that risk factors of T. saginata taeniasis for families were: level of education (P<0.01); consumption of beef lawar (P<0.01); and the source of lawar (P<0.01).","Wandra T, Sutisna P, Dharmawan NS, Margono SS, Sudewi R, Suroso T, Craig PS, Ito A",Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,2006 Apr,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
20559005,"Relationship between different species of helminths and atopy: a study in a population living in helminth-endemic area in Sulawesi, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: The association between allergen skin sensitization and helminth infection has been debated for years. Here, we sought to estimate the prevalence of atopic sensitization of residents living in area endemic for lymphatic filariasis and intestinal helminths and to investigate the association between these different species of helminths with allergen skin test reactivity to allergens. METHODS: Five hundred and eighty-three individuals living in an area endemic for Brugia malayi and for intestinal helminths were skin prick tested using 3 allergens. Microfilariae were enumerated by filtration of 1 ml nocturnally collected blood, and 442 stool samples were examined for the presence of intestinal helminth eggs. RESULTS: The prevalence of skin prick test positivity to any allergen was 23.5% (to cockroach 20.6%, to house dust mite 6.2% and to grass pollen 1.2%). Individuals with B. malayi infection had a significantly reduced risk for atopic reactivity to cockroach (adjusted odds ratio 0.56, 95% CI 0.35-0.88). In the same population, no association was found between the presence of intestinal helminths and any skin test reactivity. CONCLUSIONS: In a general population, across all ages in a rural area of Indonesia, the prevalence of skin test reactivity to house dust mite is as low as in other non-affluent countries, and infection with B. malayi appears to reduce the risk of skin reactivity to cockroach. On the other hand, we found no association between infection with intestinal helminths and skin test reactivity to aeroallergens.","Supali T, Djuardi Y, Wibowo H, van Ree R, Yazdanbakhsh M, Sartono E",Int Arch Allergy Immunol,2010,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
12781383,"Multiple genotypes of Taenia solium--ramifications for diagnosis, treatment and control.","Mitochondrial DNA sequences of Taenia solium have fully been analyzed. Analysis of the full length of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (1620 bp) and cytochrome b (1068 bp) genes of T. solium, isolated from Asia (China, Thailand, Indonesia and India), from Latin America (Mexico, Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru and Brazil) and from Africa (Tanzania, Mozambique and Cameroon), has revealed that the two phylogenies obtained were similar to each other regardless of the genes examined. The isolates from Asia formed a single cluster, whereas those from Latin America combined with those from Africa to form an additional cluster. It was estimated that these two genotypes emerged approximately 4-8 x 10(5) years ago. These results together with recent study of the ancient of human taeniid cestodes emerged several MYA in Africa, historical data on swine domestication, distribution of pigs and colonization patterns suggest that T. solium was introduced recently into Latin America and Africa from different regions of Europe during the colonial age, which started 500 years ago, and that T. solium of another origin independently spread in Asian countries, perhaps from China. Why did not T. solium of European origin invade or spread into Asia during the colonial age? Analysis of T. solium distribution must include other Taenia species, especially T. saginata and T. asiatica, which can not be differentiated from each other morphologically. BESS T-base analysis for differentiation of all human Taenia species including the two genotypes of T. solium, and T. saginata and T. asiatica has also been characterized. BESS T-base analysis differentiates African isolates from Latin American isolates as well but more samples should be analyzed for obtaining conclusive evidence for the latter. Serological analysis of cyst fluid of T. solium cysticerci obtained in China and Indonesia and from Mozambique and Ecuador indicates geographical differences in their banding patterns. These differences are discussed in the light of possible differences in pathology of T. solium worldwide. As it has been speculated that the ancient T. solium emerged several million years ago in Africa, it is necessary to analyze more isolates from Africa. Such working hypothesis may be evaluated combined with symptomatology and serology when we get additional DNA data from such areas, since there are some varieties of manifestation of neurocysticercosis with or without subcutaneous cysticercosis and of antigens of cyst fluid of T. solium from Asia and from Africa and/or America. Transfer of techniques of molecular identification and sero- and immuno-diagnoses between researchers and technicians from endemic countries using their own materials should be promoted with the aim of better international cooperation for the control of cysticercosis.","Ito A, Yamasaki H, Nakao M, Sako Y, Okamoto M, Sato MO, Nakaya K, Margono SS, Ikejima T, Kassuku AA, Afonso SM, Ortiz WB, Plancarte A, Zoli A, Geerts S, Craig PS",Acta Trop,2003 Jun,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
24349595,Impact of six rounds of mass drug administration on Brugian filariasis and soil-transmitted helminth infections in eastern Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: The lymphatic filarial parasite Brugia timori occurs only in eastern Indonesia where it causes high morbidity. The absence of an animal reservoir, the inefficient transmission by Anopheles mosquitoes and the high sensitivity to DEC/albendazole treatment make this species a prime candidate for elimination by mass drug administration (MDA). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We evaluated the effect of MDA using DEC and albendazole on B. timori and soil transmitted helminths (STH) in a cross-sectional study of a sentinel village on Alor Island annually over a period of 10 years. Pre-MDA the microfilaria (MF) prevalence was 26% and 80% of the residents had filaria-specific IgG4 antibodies. In 2010, 34 months after the 6(th) round of MDA, MF and antibody rates were only 0.17% and 6.4%, respectively. The MDA campaign had also a beneficial effect on STH. Baseline prevalence rates for Ascaris, hookworm and Trichuris were 34%, 28%, and 11%, respectively; these rates were reduced to 27%, 4%, and 2% one year after the 5(th) round of MDA. Unfortunately, STH rates rebounded 34 months after cessation of MDA and approached pre-MDA rates. However, the intensity of STH infection in 2009 was still reduced, and no heavy infections were detected. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: MDA with DEC/albendazole has had a major impact on B. timori MF and IgG4 antibody rates, providing a proof of principle that elimination is feasible. We also documented the value of annual DEC/albendazole as a mass de-worming intervention and the importance of continuing some form of STH control after cessation of MDA for filariasis.","Supali T, Djuardi Y, Bradley M, Noordin R, Ruckert P, Fischer PU",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,2013,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia

In Asia and the Pacific, three human taeniid species have been recognized: Taenia solium, Taenia saginata and Taenia asiatica. The first topic is on evolution of T. solium. Mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms of T. solium worldwide are discussed with emphasis of two specific genotypes: American-African and Asian. The second topic is recent major advances in sero- and molecular-diagnosis of T. solium cysticercosis in humans, pigs and dogs. The third is the present situation of T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis in Papua (Irian Jaya), Indonesia. The forth is the present situation of T. solium cysticercosis and T. saginata taeniasis in Bali, Indonesia. The fifth is the present situation of T. asiatica taeniasis in Asia and the Pacific and in North Sumatra, Indonesia. The sixth is on the debate of the exact definition of T. asiatica. Because T. asiatica can not be differentiated from T. saginata morphologically, it is time to re-evaluate T. saginata in Asia and the Pacific. New and broad-based surveys across this region are necessary from epidemiological and public health perspectives, based on evidence.","Ito A, Nakao M, Wandra T, Suroso T, Okamoto M, Yamasaki H, Sako Y, Nakaya K",Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health,2005,Helminthiasis AND Indonesia
36409588,"Expert consensus on holistic skin care routine: Focus on acne, rosacea, atopic dermatitis, and sensitive skin syndrome.","BACKGROUND: Treatment, cleansing, moisturizing, and photoprotection are four major components of holistic skin care for dermatological conditions. While treatment (T) is recognized as a key component in the management of dermatological conditions, there is a lack of practical guidance on the adjunctive role of cleansing, moisturizing, and photoprotection (""CMP""). Limited patient knowledge, confusion over product selection, and lack of guidance on how to choose and use CMP skin care products (in conjunction with pharmacological therapy) are the main barriers to establishing a holistic skin care routine for dermatological conditions. AIMS: This study aimed to review current clinical evidence, identify gaps, and provide practical guidance on conceptualization and implementation of CMP routine in the management of sensitive skin due to underlying acne, atopic dermatitis, or rosacea, including conditions with idiopathic causes referred to as idiopathic sensitive skin syndrome. METHODS: An expert panel comprising of 10 dermatologists from Australia, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, India, Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand convened to develop consensus statements on holistic skin care in acne, rosacea, atopic dermatitis, and idiopathic sensitive skin syndrome using the Delphi approach. RESULTS: Consensus was defined as >/=80% of panel rating statement as >/=8 or median rating of >/=8. The final statements were collated to develop consensus recommendations on holistic skin care. CONCLUSION: A dermatologist-guided holistic skin care routine is essential to improve patient confidence and reduce confusion over product selection. The consensus recommendations presented here highlight the importance of cleansing, moisturization, and photoprotection in holistic skin care and how it can be utilized as a communication tool for physicians and patients to achieve overall better patient compliance, satisfaction, and treatment outcomes.","Goh CL, Wu Y, Welsh B, Abad-Casintahan MF, Tseng CJ, Sharad J, Jung S, Rojanamatin J, Sitohang IBS, Chan HNK",J Cosmet Dermatol,2023 Jan,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia

35298417,Scabies: update on treatment and efforts for prevention and control in highly endemic settings.,"Scabies is a contagious parasitic skin disease caused by Sarcoptes scabiei infestation which can be transmitted through direct or indirect contact. WHO classified scabies as a neglected tropical disease. The prevalence of scabies is high in certain countries ranging from 32.1% to 74%, especially in crowded conditions such as prisons, boarding schools, and orphanages. Indonesia is one of the most heavily affected countries worldwide. Scabies might cause great impact on patients, which includes decreased concentration and academic achievement at school, social stigma, sleep disturbances, and decreased economic productivity in community. Management of scabies with anti-scabies needs to be carried out appropriately, accompanied with treatment for all contacts. Mass treatment with permethrin cream or ivermectin can be given directly to patients. Prevention is conducted by providing medical treatment and breaking the chain of transmission. Source elimination and disinfection of fomites is very important. Participation of non-medical personnel such as teachers, cadres, and parents together with the local health workers (primary health care) is highly recommended. Using checklists or application can aid non-medical personnel to determine suspected cases, thus contributing to scabies elimination. Cooperation between patients, patient's family, health workers and other non-medical personnel will greatly reduce the prevalence of scabies and ultimately improve patient's quality of life. The aim of this review is to provide an update on scabies treatment and efforts for prevention and elimination, with focus on the situation in Indonesia.","Widaty S, Miranda E, Cornain EF, Rizky LA",J Infect Dev Ctries,2022 Feb 28,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia

34364171,"Guideline for the diagnosis, treatment and long-term management of cutaneous lupus erythematosus.","Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is an inflammatory, autoimmune disease encompassing a broad spectrum of subtypes including acute, subacute, chronic and intermittent CLE. Among these, chronic CLE can be further classified into several subclasses of lupus erythematosus (LE) such as discoid LE, verrucous LE, LE profundus, chilblain LE and Blaschko linear LE. To provide all dermatologists and rheumatologists with a practical guideline for the diagnosis, treatment and long-term management of CLE, this evidence- and consensus-based guideline was developed following the checklist established by the international Reporting Items for Practice Guidelines in Healthcare (RIGHT) Working Group and was registered at the International Practice Guideline Registry Platform. With the joint efforts of the Asian Dermatological Association (ADA), the Asian Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (AADV) and the Lupus Erythematosus Research Center of Chinese Society of Dermatology (CSD), a total of 25 dermatologists, 7 rheumatologists, one research scientist on lupus and 2 methodologists, from 16 countries/regions in Asia, America and Europe, participated in the development of this guideline. All recommendations were agreed on by at least 80% of the 32 voting physicians. As a consensus, diagnosis of CLE is mainly based on the evaluation of clinical and histopathological manifestations, with an exclusion of SLE by assessment of systemic involvement. For localized CLE lesions, topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors are first-line treatment. For widespread or severe CLE lesions and (or) cases resistant to topical treatment, systemic treatment including antimalarials and (or) short-term corticosteroids can be added. Notably, antimalarials are the first-line systemic treatment for all types of CLE, and can also be used in pregnant patients and pediatric patients. Second-line choices include thalidomide, retinoids, dapsone and MTX, whereas MMF is third-line treatment. Finally, pulsed-dye laser or surgery can be added as fourth-line treatment for localized, refractory lesions of CCLE in cosmetically unacceptable areas, whereas belimumab may be used as fourth-line treatment for widespread CLE lesions in patients with active SLE, or recurrence of ACLE during tapering of corticosteroids. As for management of the disease, patient education and a long-term follow-up are necessary. Disease activity, damage of skin and other organs, quality of life, comorbidities and possible adverse events are suggested to be assessed in every follow-up visit, when appropriate.","Lu Q, Long H, Chow S, Hidayat S, Danarti R, Listiawan Y, Deng D, Guo Q, Fang H, Tao J, Zhao M, Xiang L, Che N, Li F, Zhao H, Lau CS, Ip FC, Ho KM, Paliza AC, Vicheth C, Godse K, Cho S, Seow CS, Miyachi Y, Khang TH, Ungpakorn R, Galadari H, Shah R, Yang K, Zhou Y, Selmi C, Sawalha AH, Zhang X, Chen Y, Lin CS",J Autoimmun,2021 Sep,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia

However, in certain conditions and individuals, it may transform into a pathogenic yeast with multiple associated dermatological disorders and various clinical manifestations. This phenomenon is influenced by a unique host-agent interaction that triggers the production of several virulence factors, such as indoles, reactive oxygen species, azelaic acid, hyphae formation, and biofilm formation. This review article discusses Malassezia virulence factors that contribute to the transformation of Malassezia from commensal to pathogenic as well as their role in dermatological disorders, including pityriasis versicolor, seborrheic dermatitis, Malassezia folliculitis, atopic dermatitis, and psoriasis.","Kurniadi I, Hendra Wijaya W, Timotius KH",Acta Dermatovenerol Alp Pannonica Adriat,2022 Jun,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
35785442,Facial skin characteristics and concerns in Indonesia: A cross-sectional observational study.,"BACKGROUND: Facial skin characteristics and appearance vary according to ethnicity. While much of this knowledge is derived from the Caucasian population, lately there have been efforts to gain such understanding in various regions in Asia.  In this paper, we have built an understanding of such features in Indonesia. In Indonesia, a section of females wears a traditional veil (hijab) to cover the scalp and part of face. The influence of the hijab on facial skin attributes was also investigated. METHODS: In a cross-sectional observational study design involving 419 female volunteers in Jakarta, Indonesia, facial skin attributes (colour, radiance, hydration, trans-epidermal water loss [TEWL], wrinkles, fine lines, pores, and sebum levels) and conditions (melasma, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), solar lentigines/ senile lentigines, seborrheic keratoses and acne) were assessed by trained operators and dermatologists using standard validated instruments and scales. RESULTS: With age, facial skin colour showed darkening in cheek; forehead on the other hand showed slight lightening. The skin evenness and radiance decreased, substantially. Aging attributes measured in terms of lines, wrinkles, and under-eye dark circles showed deterioration with age; the decline was progressively faster than colour change. Facial image data analysis corroborated these findings. Skin hydration remained similar across the age groups even though the skin barrier function measured in terms of TEWL improved with age. Sebum levels in the skin were similar up to the age of 50 but declined in the next group of 50-60 year. Pore severity increased with age. Melasma, seborrheic keratosis and PIH showed a high prevalence (> approximately 50%) at the young age group (20-30 years), itself. Melasma prevalence attained 100% in the age group of 41-50 year and onwards, and its severity similarly showed a steady rise with age. PIH on the other hand showed a steady decline with age. Solar lentigines prevalence ( approximately 30%) did not change much across age groups, and the severity scores were similar in age groups up to 50 year but increased substantially in 51-60-year age groups. Seborrheic keratosis was similar ( approximately 47%) in age groups up 20-40 year but steadily increased in upper age groups. Its severity was similar in the age groups of 20-30 year and 31-40 year but showed a two-fold increase in subsequent age groups. Acne was 10% in the age group of 20-30 year and declined gradually to 0.7% in the 51-60-year age group. Hijab wearers showed slight protection in skin colour darkening and improvement of evenness and radiance but were similar on aging (fine lines and wrinkles on crow's feet, under eye and peri-oral areas) markers to non-wearers. In general, in majority of age-groups, hijab wearers showed a higher prevalence of melasma, solar/senile lentigines, seborrheic keratosis and PIH.","Du Y, Doraiswamy C, Mao J, Zhang Q, Liang Y, Du Z, Vasantharaghavan R, Joshi MK",Skin Res Technol,2022 Sep,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
34974106,Annular infectious dermatoses.,"Annular configuration is conspicuous in the clinical manifestation of many skin diseases and can be helpful for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis. Variations may include arciform, ring-form, annular, circinate, serpiginous, gyrated, polycyclic, targeted or figurate forms, in different colors, sizes, and numbers, with various textures and surfaces. In infectious dermatoses, the annular reactions can be specific or nonspecific, while the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In the specific reactions caused by direct invasion of the pathogens, the contest between the centrifugal outspread of the infectious agents and the centripetal impedance of the host immune response is supposed to determine the final conformation. Examples include erythema infectiosum, orf, erythema multiforme, and pityriasis rosea of viral origin. Bacterial infections that may display annular lesions include erythrasma, erythema (chronicum) migrans of Lyme borreliosis, secondary syphilis, cutaneous tuberculosis, and leprosy. Superficial mycosis, such as dermatophytosis, candida intertrigo, tinea imbricata, and subcutaneous mycosis, such as chromoblastomycosis, and algae infection protothecosis, are characterized by annular progression of the skin lesions. The creeping serpiginous extension is an alarming sign for the diagnosis of cutaneous larva migrans. A better understanding of the virulence and pathogenicity of the pathogens and the way and type of immune response will help to clarify the pathogenesis.","Liu WT, Sun PL, Bramono K, Ezmerli M, Yang CC, Chen W",Clin Dermatol,2022 Sep-Oct,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia

Genetic discoveries for hair disorders have been recently augmented with the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. We reviewed the literature and summarized disease-gene associations for inherited hair disorders, as well as genodermatoses presenting with hair abnormalities discovered by NGS technologies. We identified 28 nonsyndromic hair disorders, involving 25 individual genes and four unidentified genes. We have also discovered that approximately 30% of all the genodermatoses that were identified by NGS approaches demonstrated hair abnormalities as part of their phenotype.

23389637,Occupational skin hazards and prevalence of occupational skin diseases in shoe manufacturing workers in Indonesia.,"PURPOSE: Shoe manufacturing workers are exposed daily to an extensive range of potential physical and chemical occupational hazards. Shoe manufacturing in Indonesia is one of the industrial sectors that has shown sustained growth amongst the newly industrialized countries (NICs). In this study, we investigated the possible potential exposure of the workers to physical and occupational hazards and determined the prevalence of occupational skin diseases at a shoe manufacturing factory in Indonesia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study on the observation of the working process and an inventory and risk assessment of exposure to the chemicals used. Classification of chemicals as potential sensitizers/irritants and qualitative assessments of these chemicals were done. Workers were examined and interviewed using the Nordic Occupational Skin Questionnaire-2002/LONG. RESULTS: The risk of Occupational skin diseases (OSD) at the shoe factory was mainly related to the exposure of the workers' skin to potential physical and chemical hazards in hot and humid environmental conditions. From a total of 514 workers, 8.5 % reported current OSD and 4.8 % reported a history of OSD. Occupational skin diseases were diagnosed in 29 % of the workers by dermatologists and 7.6 % had an occupational contact dermatitis (OCD). Of the 39 workers with contact dermatitis, 33 consented to being patch tested, 14 (3 %) workers showed a positive results and considered as having an occupational allergic contact dermatitis (OACD) and 25 (4.9 %) had an occupational irritant contact dermatitis (OICD). CONCLUSION: We observed a repeated and prolonged exposure of the workers to numerous physical and chemical skin hazards at this factory.","Febriana SA, Soebono H, Coenraads PJ",Int Arch Occup Environ Health,2014 Feb,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia

BV and BV therapy have long been attractive to different cultures, with extensive studies during recent decades. Nowadays, BV is applied to combat several skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis, acne vulgaris, alopecia, vitiligo, and psoriasis. BV is used extensively in topical preparations as cosmetics and used as dressing for wound healing, as well as in facemasks. Nevertheless, the safety of BV as a therapeutic choice has always been a concern due to the immune system reaction in some people due to BV use. The documented unfavorable impact is explained by the fact that the skin reactions to BV might expand to excessive immunological responses, including anaphylaxis, that typically resolve over numerous days.

A prospective cohort study was conducted in an acute care ward in Indonesia. Risk factors for pressure ulcers and superficial skin changes were identified based on the Bergstrom Braden conceptual model. Microclimate data were collected every 3 days for 15 days while the development of pressure ulcers and superficial skin changes was observed every day. Pressure ulcers and superficial skin changes were developed in 20 of the 71 participants. Total mean difference in skin temperature was higher for patients with pressure ulcers and superficial skin changes (0.9 +/- 0.6 degrees C) compared with controls (0.6 +/- 0.8 degrees C) (P = 0.071). Binary logistic regression predictor values for pressure ulcers and superficial skin changes were 0.111 for type of sheet and 0.347 for Braden Scale results. In conclusion, difference in skin temperature seems to be a predictor for pressure ulcer development and superficial skin changes, while synthetic fibre sheets are able to maintain a beneficial microclimate.","Yusuf S, Okuwa M, Shigeta Y, Dai M, Iuchi T, Rahman S, Usman A, Kasim S, Sugama J, Nakatani T, Sanada H",Int Wound J,2015 Feb,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia

A population-based survey (n = 917) was conducted in October and November 1999 to determine the prevalence of skin diseases in 3 rural villages in Indonesia (Riau province, Sumatra). The overall individual response rate was 96%. Household interviews were conducted to obtain information on skin conditions, basic socio-demographic factors and lifestyle habits. Trained doctors performed a thorough clinical skin examination of each subject in the household. The overall prevalence of skin disease in the 3 villages was 28.2% (95% confidence intervals 24.6-31.8). The prevalence of fungal infections (12.0%) was twice as high as dermatitis (5.1%). As skin conditions are common in rural Indonesia, it is advisable to improve the training of nurses and doctors in the prevention and treatment of skin disorders.","Saw SM, Koh D, Adjani MR, Wong ML, Hong CY, Lee J, Chia SE, Munoz CP, Ong CN",Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,2001 Jul-Aug,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
38169455,Teledermatology to Improve Access to and Quality of Skin Care in Eastern Indonesia.,"Skin diseases are a major public health concern in Indonesia, although access to specialized care in remote areas is limited. We initiated a low-cost teledermatology service in Sumba, a remote island in eastern Indonesia. Eighteen healthcare workers (HCWs) at five primary healthcare centers received training to manage common skin diseases and submit clinical cases beyond their expertise to an online platform. Submitted cases were reviewed by at least one dermatologist. Diagnostic agreement between HCWs and dermatologists was calculated. The HCWs participated in a satisfaction survey 2 years after project initiation. Since October 2020, of 10,384 patients presenting with skin complaints in a 24-month period, 307 (3%) were submitted for a teledermatology consultation. The most frequent skin diseases were infections and infestations (n = 162, 52.8%) and eczematous (85, 27.7%) and inflammatory (17, 5.5%) conditions. Fifty-three patients (17.3%) were diagnosed with a neglected tropical skin disease, including leprosy and scabies. Dermatologist advice was provided within a median of 50 minutes (interquartile range, 18-255 minutes), with 91.9% of consultations occurring within 24 hours. The diagnostic agreement level between HCWs and dermatologists significantly improved over time, from 46.9% in the first 6-month period (kappa = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.37-0.54) to 77.2% in the last 6-month period (kappa = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.67-0.86; global P < 0.001). The HCWs reported that the teledermatology service was extremely/very useful in supporting daily practice (100%) and improved their knowledge of skin diseases tremendously/a lot (92%). Teledermatology can improve accessibility and quality of skin services in medically underserved areas, providing opportunities for scalability and knowledge transfer to frontline HCWs.","Adella FJ, Ammah H, Siregar GO, Harianja M, Sundari ES, Sagara R, Tarino N, Hamers RL, Bogh C, Soebono H, Grijsen ML",Am J Trop Med Hyg,2024 Feb 7,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
38566380,Skin Microbial Composition and Genetic Mutation Analysis in Precision Medicine for Epidermolysis Bullosa.,"Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is an inherited skin disease representing a spectrum of rare genetic disorders. These conditions share the common trait that causes fragile skin, resulting in the development of blisters and erosions. The inheritance follows an autosomal pattern, and the array of clinical presentations leads to significant physical suffering, considerable morbidity, and mortality. Despite EB having no cure, effectively managing EB remains an exceptional challenge due to its rarity and complexity, occasionally casting a profound impact on the lives of affected individuals. Considering that EB management requires a multidisciplinary approach, this sometimes worsens the condition of patients with EB due to inappropriate handling. Thus, more appropriate and precise treatment management of EB is essentially needed. Advanced technology in medicine and health comes into the bioinformatics era. Including treatment for skin diseases, omics-based approaches aim to evaluate and handle better disease management and treatment. In this work, we review several approaches regarding the implementation of omics-based technology, including genetics, pathogenic mutation, skin microbiomics, and metagenomics analysis for EB. In addition, we highlight recent updates on the potential of metagenomics analysis in precision medicine for EB.","Syafarina I, Mazaya M, Indrawati A, Akbar SZ, Sukowati C, Sadikin R",Curr Drug Targets,2024,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia

The voting was based on the best available scientific evidence and was independent of drug access or practice restrictions in the different Asian countries. The latter were discussed when appropriate. The aim of these guidelines is to provide guidance for the harmonisation of the management of patients with MBC across the different regions of Asia, drawing from data provided by global and Asian trials whilst at the same time integrating the differences in genetics, demographics and scientific evidence, together with restricted access to certain therapeutic strategies.","Im SA, Gennari A, Park YH, Kim JH, Jiang ZF, Gupta S, Fadjari TH, Tamura K, Mastura MY, Abesamis-Tiambeng MLT, Lim EH, Lin CH, Sookprasert A, Parinyanitikul N, Tseng LM, Lee SC, Caguioa P, Singh M, Naito Y, Hukom RA, Smruti BK, Wang SS, Kim SB, Lee KH, Ahn HK, Peters S, Kim TW, Yoshino T, Pentheroudakis G, Curigliano G, Harbeck N",ESMO Open,2023 Jun,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
36609416,"Risk factors of occupational skin diseases among traditional batik manufacturing workers in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.","OBJECTIVE: Batik is one of the Indonesian traditional arts made by decorating fabric using the resist dyeing technique. Currently, batik manufacturing serves as an important source of livelihood in Indonesia. However, the production process of traditional batik involves a range of chemicals and some repetitive physical movements, making batik production inseparable from physical and chemical hazards which increase the risk of developing occupational skin diseases (OSD). This study aimed to identify the risk factors related to OSD, including occupational contact dermatitis (OCD), among traditional batik manufacturing workers in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. RESULTS: The study demonstrated that working duration (>/= 8 h daily) and type of work (wet process only) were statistically significant as risk factors for developing OSD. While for OCD, our results found that gender (male), history of atopy, and type of work (all and wet phase only) were risk factors for OCD development among traditional batik manufacturing workers.","Febriana SA, Erdina, Dewi K, Ridora Y, Anggraeni A, Indrastuti N, Waskito F, Oginawati K, Tanziha I, Prakoeswa CRS",BMC Res Notes,2023 Jan 6,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
37164680,Skin properties of itching without symptoms and associated factors among older adults in long-term care facilities.,"Since itching without rash frequently among older adults' population, study about skin properties of itching without rash is important to develop prevention methods. Therefore, this study explored the skin properties related to itching without rash and the factors associated with them. A correlation, predictive designs study was conducted at Indonesian Long-term Care (LTC) facilities. Skin properties including skin barrier function and skin inflammation were examined by photographs (macroscopic and microscopic), stratum corneum (SC) hydration, skin Potential of Hydrogen (pH), and skin blotting. Itching experience and skincare behavior were obtained by questionnaire. The itching-related skin properties and associated factors were analyzed. A total of 405 residents participated in this study, with mean age was 74 years. The prevalence of itching on the whole body was 69.1%, and 50.3% of those manifesting itching on the left forearm involved itching without macroscopic abnormalities (itching without rash). SC hydration, skin pH, albumin and nerve growth factor beta (NGFbeta) were associated with itching without rash (p = 0.007, 0.012, < 0.001, and < 0.001, respectively). Additionally, factors associated with skin properties were age, sex, sun exposure experience, skincare, and hygiene care in the linear regression analysis. Measurement of skin biomarkers using skin blotting was a possible objective measurement of itching skin properties without rash regardless of the environmental condition.","Sari DW, Minematsu T, Yoshida M, Kitamura A, Tomida S, Abe M, Khasanah U, Sanada H",Drug Discov Ther,2023 Jul 12,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
33818413,Hospital-acquired Skin and Skin-structure Infection in COVID-19 Infected Patient with Prolonged Hospitalization.,"Acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections (ABSSSI) is defined in 2013 by the US Food and Drug Administration as a bacterial cellulitis/erysipelas, major skin abscesses, and wound infections. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 2014 classifies skin and soft-tissue infection (SSTI) as either non-purulent (which includes cellulitis, erysipelas, and necrotizing infection) or purulent (including furuncle, carbuncle, and abscess). Among hospitalized patients with SSTI, healthcare-associated infections account for 73.5% of all cases. Notably, skin and skin-structure infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common hospital pathogen, was reported to cause higher total cost and longer hospital length of stay compared to non-P. aeruginosa cases, despite causing only approximately 5.7% of all healthcare-associated SSTIs. Infection with P. aeruginosa should always be considered in non-healing skin infections in patients with prolonged hospitalization and antibiotic exposure. Tissue culture, preferably taken by surgical debridement, should be promptly performed; and when hospital-infection is suspected, appropriate antibiotics should be started along with removal of all devitalized tissue and to promote skin and soft tissue healing. Expedited discharge should be considered when possible, with adequate antibiotic treatment and follow up for definitive wound treatment.","Nelwan EJ, Tunjungputri RN, Tunjung N, Widodo D",Acta Med Indones,2021 Jan,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
29124834,"Prevalence and characterisation of Staphylococcus aureus causing community-acquired skin and soft tissue infections on Java and Bali, Indonesia.","OBJECTIVES: To define the role of Staphylococcus aureus in community settings among patients with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) in Indonesia. METHODS: Staphylococcus aureus were cultured from anterior nares, throat and wounds of 567 ambulatory patients presenting with SSTI. The mecA gene and genes encoding Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL; lukF-PV and lukS-PV) and exfoliative toxin (ET; eta and etb) were determined by PCR. Clonal relatedness among methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and PVL-positive S. aureus was analysed using multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) typing, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) for a subset of isolates. Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) was determined for all MRSA isolates. Moreover, determinants for S. aureus SSTI, and PVL/ET-positive vs PVL/ET-negative S. aureus were assessed. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus were isolated from SSTI wounds of 257 (45.3%) patients, eight (3.1%) of these were MRSA. Genes encoding PVL and ETs were detected in 21.8% and 17.5% of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), respectively. PVL-positive MRSA was not detected. Nasopharyngeal S. aureus carriage was an independent determinant for S. aureus SSTI (odds ratio [OR] 1.8). Primary skin infection (OR 5.4) and previous antibiotic therapy (OR 3.5) were associated with PVL-positive MSSA. Primary skin infection (OR 2.2) was the only factor associated with ET-positive MSSA. MLVA typing revealed two more prevalent MSSA clusters. One ST1-MRSA-SCCmec type IV isolate and a cluster of ST239-MRSA-SCCmec type III were found. CONCLUSIONS: Community-acquired SSTI in Indonesia was frequently caused by PVL-positive MSSA, and the hospital-associated ST239-MRSA may have spread from the hospital into the community.","Santosaningsih D, Santoso S, Setijowati N, Rasyid HA, Budayanti NS, Suata K, Widhyatmoko DB, Purwono PB, Kuntaman K, Damayanti D, Prakoeswa CRS, Laurens M, van Nierop JWI, Nanninga GL, Oudenes N, de Regt M, Snijders SV, Verbrugh HA, Severin JA",Trop Med Int Health,2018 Jan,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
21938525,Inventory of the chemicals and the exposure of the workers' skin to these at two leather factories in Indonesia.,"PURPOSE: Tannery workers are exposed to hazardous chemicals. Tannery work is outsourced to newly industrialized countries (NICs) where attention into occupational health hazards is limited. In this study, we investigated the skin exposure to hazardous chemicals in tannery workers and determined the prevalence of occupational skin diseases (OSDs) at tanneries in a NIC. METHODS: A cross-sectional study on the observation of the working process and an inventory and risk assessment of the chemicals used. Classification of chemicals as potential sensitizers/irritants and a qualitative assessment of exposure to these chemicals. Workers were examined and interviewed using Nordic Occupational Skin Questionnaire-2002/LONG. RESULTS: The risk of OSDs at the investigated tanneries was mainly related to the exposure of the workers' skin to chemicals in hot and humid environmental conditions. In 472 workers, 12% reported a current OSD and 9% reported a history of OSD. In 10% of all cases, an OSD was confirmed by a dermatologist and 7.4% had an occupational contact dermatitis (OCD). We observed that personal protective equipment (PPE) used was mainly because of skin problems in the past and not as a primary protection against OSD. CONCLUSION: We observed a high frequency and prolonged exposure to many skin hazardous factors in tannery work although PPE was relatively easily available and which was generally used as a secondary preventative measure. The observed point-prevalence in this study was at the same level as that reported for other high-risk OSDs in Western countries and other tanneries in NICs. However, the observed point-prevalence in this study was lower than that reported in India and Korea. The results of our study and those of other studies at tanneries from other NICs were probably influenced by Healthy Worker Survivor Effect (HWSE).","Febriana SA, Jungbauer F, Soebono H, Coenraads PJ",Int Arch Occup Environ Health,2012 Jul,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
37452458,Phenotype and genotype correlation of inherited epidermolysis bullosa in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Inherited epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of genodermatoses with considerable clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Clinical diagnosis of the EB subtypes is frequently imprecise and requires confirmation with genetic testing. There is still limited study using genetic testing to identify EB subtypes in Indonesia. This study aims to identify the pathogenic variants of inherited EB patients at the Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Universitas Padjadjaran-Dr Hasan Sadikin General Hospital in Bandung, West Java, Indonesia and to describe the correlation between the phenotype and genotype of our patients. METHODS: Twelve patients clinically diagnosed with EB were included in this study. Genetic testing was performed in collaboration with KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore. RESULTS: Pathogenic variants were identified in the COL7A1 gene in seven patients, namely Dominant Dystrophic EB (DDEB) with mutation types c.5945G>T, c.6218G>A, Recessive Dystrophic EB (RDEB) c.2005C>T, c.6081dup, c.1268C>T, c.1784C>T which are all known mutations. Novel mutations were found in the COL7A1 gene in two patients namely DDEB c.6253G>T and RDEB c.6740C>T. Two EB Simplex (EBS) patients showed mutation KRT14 gene as c.356T>C, c.373C>T which are known mutation. In addition, a novel mutation in LAMA3 gene c.2649del was found in one Junctional EB (JEB) patient. CONCLUSION: The molecular diagnoses of 12 Indonesian EB patients were identified, of which three were novel pathogenic variants. Concordance between the initial clinical diagnosis and genetic testing was only 33%. This demonstrated the importance of early genetic testing for accurate diagnosis, prognostication, management and genetic counselling.","Arline Diana I, Tan EC, Gondokaryono SP, Koh MJ, Dwiyana RF, Rahardja JI, Yogya Y, Rafi'ee K, Suwarsa O",Australas J Dermatol,2023 Nov,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
39053073,Identification and characterization of Staphylococcus argenteus from Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: In 2015, Staphylococcus argenteus was reported for the first time as a novel species of the Staphylococcus aureus complex. While S. argenteus has been found in many countries, its presence in Indonesia has not been reported yet. Our aim is to confirm S. argenteus presence in Indonesia, describe its characteristics and analyze its genomic diversity. METHODS: The S. aureus isolates used in this study were collected from patients with skin and soft tissue infections in Indonesia, between July 2009 to February 2010. Randomly selected isolates were recultured from -80 C degrees  stocks and analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization - time of flight (MALDI-TOF). Isolates identified as S. argenteus, S. roterodami, or S. schweitzeri and S. aureus with a low score in the MALDI-TOF analysis were analyzed by a real-time PCR targeting the nucA gene able to identify true S. argenteus. Isolates identified as S. argenteus were further characterized by whole genome sequencing. Vitek(R)2 (bioMerieux) was used for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. RESULTS: Fifteen isolates were identified as S. argenteus, with the majority belonging to ST2250. Two pairs of isolates proved to be identical by core genome multilocus sequence typing analysis. Most isolates were susceptible to all antibiotics tested, except for seven isolates (46.7 %) that were resistant to benzylpenicillin, and one isolate was resistant to tetracycline (6.7 %). The presence of resistance genes blaZ and tet(45) correlated with these findings. Notably, the sey enterotoxin gene was prevalent in 80 % of the isolates. Other virulence factor genes were less prevalent. Plasmid replicon types in S. argenteus were also known to S. aureus. CONCLUSION: Our study reveals the occurrence of S. argenteus in Indonesia. The diversity within Indonesian S. argenteus matches the global diversity of S. argenteus. Identical isolates between patients indicate potential transmission events. A lower prevalence of a broad panel of virulence factors suggests that S. argenteus is less virulent than S. aureus.","Supriadi IR, Santosaningsih D, Budayanti NS, Zandijk WHA, Rijfkogel A, Klaassen CHW, Severin JA",Int J Med Microbiol,2024 Sep,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
36997563,Hazard identification and the prevalence of occupational skin disease in Indonesian Batik workers.,"Batik, a resist-dyeing technique to decorate a special cotton fabric, has been practiced for centuries in Indonesia. Unfortunately, as an informal enterprise, batik industry activities lack work safety and health regulations. This study aimed to identify potential health hazards, including inventorying the chemicals to which the workers are exposed, the PPE profile, and investigating the prevalence of occupational skin diseases (OSD) in the batik industry. A cross-sectional study and an inventory of exposure to the chemicals were done in traditional batik workplaces in 5 districts in Yogyakarta province, Indonesia. The chemicals were classified as potential sensitizers/irritants, and the workers were examined and interviewed using the Nordic Occupational Skin Questionnaire-2002/LONG. Of 222 traditional batik workers, OSD were diagnosed in 61 (27.5%) workers, with occupational contact dermatitis was the most common OSD encountered (n = 23/61; 37.7%) (allergic contact dermatitis n = 7/23; irritant contact dermatitis n = 16/23). A smaller portion of other OSD was also encountered including callus, miliaria, and nail disorder (9%, 6.3%, and 5.9%, respectively). During each step of the traditional batik manufacturing process, the workers are exposed to substances that act as irritants and/or as potential contact allergens. However, only one-fourth of the workers used PPE regularly, particularly during the coloring process and wax removal (wet processes). Traditional batik manufacturing process exposes the worker to various physical and chemical hazards, resulting in a high prevalence of occupational skin diseases, especially contact dermatitis among the employees.","Febriana SA, Ridora Y, Indrastuti N, Dewi K, Erdina, Oginawati K, Tanziha I, Prakoeswa CRS, Waskito F, Schuttelaar ML",Sci Rep,2023 Mar 30,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
33739439,Inherited skin disorders presenting with poikiloderma.,"Poikiloderma is a skin condition that combines atrophy, telangiectasia, and macular pigment changes (hypo- as well as hyperpigmentation). It is often mistaken for mottled pigmentation by general practitioners or nondermatology specialists. Poikiloderma can be a key presenting symptom of Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS), dyskeratosis congenita (DC), hereditary sclerosing poikiloderma (HSP), hereditary fibrosing poikiloderma with tendon contractures, myopathy, and pulmonary fibrosis (POIKTMP), xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Bloom syndrome (BS), Kindler syndrome (KS), and Clericuzio-type poikiloderma with neutropenia (PN). In these conditions, poikiloderma starts early in life, usually before the second or third year. They may also be associated with photosensitivity and other significant multi-organ manifestation developed later in life. Poikiloderma could indicate the presence of a genetic disorder with potentially serious consequences. Poikiloderma almost always precedes more severe manifestations of these genodermatoses. Prompt diagnosis at the time of presentation could help to prevent complications and mitigate the course of the disease. This review discusses these to help the practicing clinician manage patients presenting with the symptom. To further facilitate early recognition, this paper also proposes a simple diagnostic algorithm.","Rayinda T, van Steensel M, Danarti R",Int J Dermatol,2021 Nov,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
34110110,The frequency and clinicopathological significance of NRAS mutations in primary cutaneous nodular melanoma in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Melanoma is a lethal skin malignancy with a high risk of metastasis, which prompts a need for research on treatment targets and prognostic factors. Recent studies show that the presence of neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS) mutation can influence cell growth in melanomas. The NRAS mutation, which stimulates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, is associated with a lower survival rate. However, evidence from Indonesia population is still very rare. Further understanding of the role of NRAS mutations in Indonesian melanoma cases will be crucial in developing new management strategies for melanoma patients with NRAS mutations. AIMS: To explore the frequency of NRAS mutations and their clinicopathological associations in patients with primary nodular cutaneous melanoma in Central Java and Yogyakarta, Indonesia. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-one paraffin-embedded tissue samples were collected from primary nodular skin melanoma cases between 2011 and 2019 from the two largest referral hospitals in Yogyakarta and Central Java, Indonesia. The NRAS mutation status was evaluated using qualitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The association of NRAS mutation was analyzed with the following: age, gender, location, lymph node metastasis, ulceration, mitotic index, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), necrosis, tumor thickness, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and tumor size. NRAS mutations were detected in 10 (19.6%) samples and predominantly observed (60%) in exon 2 (G12). These mutations were significantly correlated with lymph node metastases (p = .000); however, they were not associated with other variables analyzed in this study. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of NRAS mutations in primary nodular cutaneous melanoma cases from Indonesia is consistent with previous studies and is significantly associated with increased lymph node metastases. However, the predominant mutation detected in exon 2 (G12) is different from previous studies conducted in other countries. This suggests that melanoma cases in Javanese people have different characteristics from other ethnicities.","Rinonce HT, Sastri DJ, Trisnawati F, Kameswari B, Ferronika P, Irianiwati",Cancer Rep (Hoboken),2022 Jan,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
33248877,Validity of skin blot examination for albumin and nerve growth factor beta to detect itching of the skin in Indonesian older adults.,"AIM: Itching, a common skin disorder, impacts the quality of life of individuals. Itchy skin occurs more with increasing age and the prediction of itchy skin prognosis is necessary to provide good skincare. This study validated biomarkers in skin blotting to identify and measure itching sensation as well as conventional methods to measure skin barrier function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From a cross-sectional study conducted in Long-term Care (LTC) facilities in Indonesia itching symptoms were obtained through a questionnaire. Skin conditions were assessed using photographs, stratum corneum (SC) hydration, skin pH, and skin blotting for biomarkers: albumin, interleukin 2 (IL2), nerve growth factor beta (NGFbeta), and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). Association of skin measurements with the presence of skin blotting and trends analysis were conducted. RESULTS: Altogether, 564 LTC residents (average age, 70 years) participated. The SC hydration, skin pH, albumin, and NGFbeta were associated with the presence of itch (p value= <0.001, <0.001, <0.001, and <0.001, respectively). The signal levels of skin blotting biomarkers were higher in itch group than in the non-itch group. Additionally, the higher quantile of SC hydration was significantly associated with a lower intensity level of NGFbeta and TSLP (p value = 0.005, 0.003, respectively). The lower quantile of skin pH (better skin condition) was significantly associated with lower albumin, NGFbeta, and TSLP (p value = 0.048, 0.035, and <0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: The albumin, NGFbeta, and TSLP could be a candidate for measurement of itchy skin among older adult with disrupted skin barrier function and local skin inflammation.","Sari DW, Minematsu T, Yoshida M, Noguchi-Watanabe M, Tomida S, Kitamura A, Abe M, Sanada H",J Tissue Viability,2021 Feb,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia

This review aims to comprehensively evaluate the effects of quercetin on skin-related issues, adhering to the PRISMA guidelines and analyzing studies from ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. Of the 1,398 studies identified, 65 studies met the criteria for meta-analysis. The meta-analysis indicated that quercetin had powerful antioxidant properties, protecting against oxidative stress by significantly lowering levels of MDA (Z-score, 2.51), ROS (Z-score, 3.81), and LPO (Z-score, 4.46), and enhancing enzymes of GSH (Z-score, 5.46), CAT (Z-score, 5.20), and SOD (Z-score, 4.37). Quercetin acted as an anti-inflammatory by significantly suppressing protein regulators such as NF-kappabeta, AP-1, and MAPKs (ERK and JNK), cytokines of TNFalpha, IL-6, IL-1beta, IL-8, and MCP-1, and enzymes of COX-2, iNOS, and MPO, while upregulating the cytokine IL-10. Additionally, quercetin significantly suppressed IL-4 (Z-score, 3.16) and IFNgamma (Z-score, 3.76) cytokines involved in chronic inflammation of atopic dermatitis. Quercetin also supported wound healing by significantly decreasing inflammatory cells (Z-score, 5.60) and enhancing fibroblast distribution (Z-score, 5.98), epithelialization (Z-score, 8.57), collagen production (Z-score, 4.20), and angiogenesis factors of MVD (Z-score, 5.66) and VEGF (Z-score, 3.86). Furthermore, quercetin significantly inhibited tyrosinase activity (Z-score, 1.95), resulting in a significantly reduced melanin content (Z-score, 2.56). A significant reduction in DNA damage (Z-score, 3.27), melanoma cell viability (Z-score, 2.97), and tumor formation was also observed to ensure the promising activity of quercetin for skin issues.

Marine resources represent a promising source of novel bioactive compounds for new cosmetic ingredient development. However, concern about sustainability also becomes an issue that should be considered in developing cosmetic ingredients. The fisheries industry (e.g., fishing, farming, and processing) generates large amounts of leftovers containing valuable substances, which are potent sources of cosmeceutical ingredients. Several bioactive substances could be extracted from the marine by-product that can be utilized as a potent ingredient to develop cosmetics products. Those bioactive substances (e.g., collagen from fish waste and chitin from crustacean waste) could be utilized as anti-photoaging, anti-wrinkle, skin barrier, and hair care products. From this perspective, this review aims to approach the potential active ingredients derived from marine by-products for cosmetics and discuss the possible activity of those active ingredients in promoting human beauty. In addition, this review also covers the prospect and challenge of using marine by-products toward the emerging concept of sustainable blue cosmetics.","Siahaan EA, Agusman, Pangestuti R, Shin KH, Kim SK",Mar Drugs,2022 Nov 24,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia

36441050,Survivor's experience in fighting breast cancer.,"Considering that breast cancer diagnosis affects a woman physically and emotionally, treatment during the therapy phase requires enthusiasm. Therefore, this study aims to explore breast cancer survivors' experiences with treatment. A qualitative methodology was used, while the data were collected with in-depth interviews and analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. The study samples included up to five individuals who met the inclusion criteria of having stage III breast cancer for longer than 5 years without metastases and were obtained using the purposive sampling technique. Two themes emerged from the interview data, namely, the past events and the psychological state of breast cancer patients. There were four subthemes under the overall theme of the events, including risk factors for breast cancer, symptoms, extensive therapy, and preventing metastases. Meanwhile, the psychological state theme contained six sub-themes, including rejection and anger against diagnosis, despair, embracing the disease, self-concept, and stress. Before beginning treatment, patients implicitly expect clinicians to provide them with a thorough explanation of how chemotherapy works. Based on the results, it can be concluded that supporting and empowering breast cancer patients is a struggle for caregivers and healthcare professionals.","Novitarum L, Siregar MFG, Siregar FA, Lubis NL",J Popul Ther Clin Pharmacol,2022,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
34382846,Effect of interface pressure and skin surface temperature on pressure injury incidence: a turning schedule pilot study.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the interface pressure and skin surface temperature in relation to the incidence of pressure injury (PI) using three different turning schedules. METHOD: This was a pilot study with a three-armed randomised clinical trial design. Participants at risk of PI and treated in the high dependency care unit in a regional hospital in Makassar, Indonesia participated in this study. Patients were repositioned at three different turning schedules (two-, three- and four-hourly intervals). Interface pressure measurement and skin surface temperature were measured between 14:00 and 18:00 every three days. The incidence of PI was assessed during the two-week observation period. RESULTS: A total of 44 participants took part in the study. A one-way ANOVA test revealed no difference in interface pressure among the three different turning schedule groups within two weeks of observations: day zero, p=0.56; day four, p=0.95; day seven, p=0.56; day 10, p=0.63; and day 14, p=0.92. Although the average periumbilical temperature and skin surface temperature were not significant (p>0.05), comparison between these observation sites was significant on all observation days (p<0.05). Regarding the incidence of PI, the proportional hazard test for the development of PI in the three groups was considered not different (hazard ratio: 1.46, 95% confidence interval: 0.43-4.87, p=0.54). CONCLUSION: No difference in interface pressure and incidence of PI on the three turning schedules was observed; however, there was a potential increase in skin surface temperature in comparison with periumbilical temperature for all three turning schedules.","Tarigan S, Yusuf S, Syam Y",J Wound Care,2021 Aug 2,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
28801156,Alarming Burden of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer in India.,"Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women worldwide. Among the different breast cancer subtypes, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is more prevalent among younger age women, is the most aggressive form. Numerous clinicopathologic studies performed throughout the world strongly support the utterly poor prognoses and high recurrence rate of TNBC. The present report details a thorough data survey from Google and PubMed on the burden of TNBC worldwide and other associated factors, with special emphasis on its ever increasing incidence among Indian women. Our analysis revealed that the proportion of TNBC ranges from 6.7% to 27.9% in different countries, with the highest reported percentage in India among all, followed by Indonesia, Algeria, and Pakistan. Most of the other countries (Netherlands, Italy, London, Germany) had a TNBC incidence less than the mean level (ie, 15%). The high incidence of TNBC in the Indian population is associated with vivid risk factors, which primarily include lifestyle, deprivation status, obesity, family history, high mitotic indexes, and BRCA1 mutations. The treatment of TNBC is greatly hampered due to the lack of targeted therapies. Hence, it requires earnest attention towards extensive research for the prevention and development of treatment modalities with high efficacy.","Thakur KK, Bordoloi D, Kunnumakkara AB",Clin Breast Cancer,2018 Jun,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
37749969,Prevalence of the HLA-Cw6 genotype and zinc deficiency in psoriasis vulgaris patients in Indonesia.,"INTRODUCTION: Psoriasis vulgaris is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease influenced by genetic and immunologic factors, including micronutrient deficiencies. The HLA-Cw6 gene and zinc level have been separately studied in psoriasis patients, yielding inconsistent findings. A descriptive study regarding HLA-Cw6 allele expression, zinc levels, and their direct correlation in Indonesia is lacking. METHODS: This prospective case-control study involved 33 psoriasis patients and 33 age- and sex-matched control patients at the dermatology clinic affiliated with Hasanuddin University in South Sulawesi in 2021. Cases were classified into mild, moderate, and severe psoriasis according to Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score. An EDTA tube was used to take a 5 ml blood sample, followed by analysis for PCR of the HLA-Cw6 allele and a colorimetric assay to measure zinc level. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the association between HLA-Cw6 and zinc level and psoriasis disease severity. RESULTS: Among the 33 psoriatic patients enrolled in this study, three (9.1%) of the cases were classified as mild psoriasis, 10 (30.3%) were classified as moderate psoriasis, and 20 (60.6%) were classified as severe psoriasis. The HLA-Cw6 allele was detected in 93.9% of psoriasis cases and in 3% of control patients (p < 0.001). The HLA-Cw6 allele was detected consecutively in 66.7%, 90.0%, and 100% of mild, moderate, and severe psoriasis patients, respectively. Zinc levels were lower in psoriasis patients compared to controls (16.85 +/- 3.55 vs. 13.74 +/- 3.78 mumol/l). Severe psoriasis patients exhibited the lowest average zinc level (14.76 +/- 1.40 mumol/l, 15.48 +/- 4.20 mumol/l, and 12.72 +/- 3.56 mumol/l in mild, moderate, and severe patients, respectively). The mean zinc level in HLA-Cw6-positive patients was 13.68 mumol/l, and 14.6 mumol/l in HLA-Cw6-negative patients (p = 0.495). CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed the presence of HLA-Cw6 allele expression and decreased serum zinc levels in psoriasis patients compared to controls. Both factors demonstrated associations with psoriasis disease severity.","Sangian TY, Waspodo NN, Ilyas F, Djawad K, Seweng A, Tawali S",Acta Dermatovenerol Alp Pannonica Adriat,2023 Sep,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
38239249,Skin Disease Profile in Geriatric Inpatients at a Tertiary Referral Hospital.,"BACKGROUND: Elderly people are susceptible to various skin diseases. To monitor disease trends in the geriatric population, epidemiologic data on skin diseases are essential. However, studies on skin diseases in geriatric patients in Indonesia, particularly those who are hospitalised, are limited. Therefore, this retrospective study aims to determine the skin disease profile in geriatric patients at a tertiary referral hospital in Indonesia. METHODS: The subjects were all geriatric inpatients who were consulted at the Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo National General Hospital between 2017 and 2019. The patients were analysed according to sex, age and comorbidities. They were divided into 15 groups according to the diseases. Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare categorical variables. RESULTS: The most common skin diseases were infections (35.8%), dermatitis (21.8%), ulcers (12.8%), age-related skin changes (8.4%) and vascular diseases (5.3%). Dermatitis was significantly more common in males (P < 0.05), whereas infections were significantly more common in females (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Consistent with previous studies, our inpatient data showed that infections were significantly more common in females, whereas dermatitis was significantly more common in males. The data collected may contribute to epidemiologic data on skin diseases in the geriatric population.","Legiawati L, Yusharyahya SN, Astriningrum R, Pulungan AA, Kusumahapsari RW",Malays J Med Sci,2023 Dec,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
2379228,Clindamycin and cloxacillin compared in the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections.,"The subjects were 61 patients with skin or soft-tissue infections treated at the Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia. The patients, aged 15 to 59 years (40 females, 21 males), were randomly assigned to receive 300 mg of clindamycin or 500 mg of cloxacillin orally thrice daily for seven days. On day 8, the infections were cured in seven of the 31 clindamycin-treated patients and in three of the 30 cloxacillin-treated patients; on day 15, 27 of the clindamycin group and 18 of the cloxacillin group were cured; four clindamycin-treated patients and 11 cloxacillin-treated patients were improved; and one cloxacillin-treated patient failed. The between-group differences were not statistically significant. Pretreatment positive cultures were obtained in 40 patients, including Staphylococcus aureus in 24, group A beta-hemolytic streptococci in five, and a combination of S aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococci in four. Side effects were reported by three clindamycin-treated patients (gastric upset, nausea, and headache) and one cloxacillin-treated patient (nausea). Abnormal changes in laboratory test results from before to after treatment were noted in both patient groups and were probably not attributable to either drug. It is concluded that clindamycin is a safe and effective agent in the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections.","Pusponegoro EH, Wiryadi BE",Clin Ther,1990 May-Jun,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
18837699,Risk factors for sebaceous gland diseases and their relationship to gastrointestinal dysfunction in Han adolescents.,"Sebaceous gland diseases are a group of common dermatological diseases with multiple causes. To date, a systematic report of the risk factors for sebaceous gland diseases in adolescents has not been published. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and risk factors for certain sebaceous gland diseases (seborrhea, seborrheic dermatitis, acne, androgenetic alopecia and rosacea) and their relationship to gastrointestinal dysfunction in adolescents. From August-October, 2002-2005, a questionnaire survey was carried out to obtain epidemiological data about sebaceous gland diseases. Using random cluster sampling, 13 215 Han adolescents aged 12-20 years were recruited from four countries or districts (Macau; Guangzhou, China; Malaysia; and Indonesia). The statistical software SPSS ver. 13.0 was used to analyze the data. The prevalence of seborrhea, seborrheic dermatitis, acne, androgenetic alopecia and rosacea was 28.27%, 10.17%, 51.03%, 1.65% and 0.97%, respectively. Based on multivariate logistic regression analysis, the risk factors for sebaceous gland diseases included: age; duration of local residency; halitosis; gastric reflux; abdominal bloating; constipation; sweet food; spicy food; family history of acne; late night sleeping on a daily basis; excessive axillary, body and facial hair; excessive periareolar hair; and anxiety. There was a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms (halitosis; gastric reflux; abdominal bloating; constipation) between patients with and without sebaceous gland diseases (chi(2) = 150.743; P = 0.000). Gastrointestinal dysfunction is an important risk factor for diseases of the sebaceous glands and is correlated with their occurrence and development.","Zhang H, Liao W, Chao W, Chen Q, Zeng H, Wu C, Wu S, Ho HI",J Dermatol,2008 Sep,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
39841970,"Depression and anxiety in patients with type 2 diabetes in Indonesia and Malaysia: do age, diabetes duration, foot ulcers, and prescribed medication play a role?","Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are susceptible to mental health issues, impacting medication adherence and diabetes control. This study aimed to evaluate factors associated with depression and anxiety among T2DM patients in Indonesia and Malaysia. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Indonesia and Malaysia from October 2022 to April 2023 among T2DM patients. The study utilised an instrument with patient and disease data and three validated tools to assess depression, anxiety, and medication adherence. Statistical analysis, including binary logistic regression, was performed using SPSS(R) version 28 software. A study of 606 T2DM patients revealed that 56.5% were at risk of depression, while 41.6% were at risk of anxiety. Older patients with T2DM had lower rates of depression (AOR = 0.41, 0.25-0.68) and anxiety than younger patients. Normal-weight patients were less likely to experience depression and anxiety (AOR = 0.44, 0.27-0.72) than overweight patients. Patients without diabetic foot ulcers had a lower risk of depression (AOR = 0.34, 0.21-0.55) and anxiety than those with foot ulcers. Patients with a shorter duration of diabetes had a higher risk of depression (AOR = 3.27, 1.70-6.30) and anxiety than those with a longer duration. Patients on insulin-based regimens had higher rates of depression and anxiety (AOR = 2.28, 1.20-4.30) than those on metformin-based regimens. Nonadherent patients were more likely to experience depression and anxiety (AOR = 4.30, 2.22-8.32) than patients who adhered to their medication. The prevalence of depression and anxiety is concerning and influenced by factors such as age, diabetes duration, the presence of diabetic foot ulcers, and the prescribed medication regimen. Further efforts are necessary to enhance the mental health of T2DM patients and improve management outcomes.","Elnaem MH, Bukhori NAS, Tengku Mohd Kamil TK, Rahayu S, Ramatillah DL, Elrggal ME",Psychol Health Med,2025 Mar,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia

34611063,Correlation between Interstitial Lung Disease Morphology Scores Based on High-resolution Computed Tomography Chest and Skin Fibrosis Degree Based on Modified Rodnan's Skin Score on Systemic Sclerosis.,"BACKGROUND: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a systemic autoimmune disease involving a multisystem. Modified Rodnan's Skin Score (MRSS) is a gold standard for measuring skin fibrosis in SSc. In SSc, lung fibrosis disorders, especially interstitial lung disease (ILD), are the leading cause of mortality and often late in diagnosis. High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) Chest scan is a gold standard for evaluating ILD morphology, but its availability is limited. The degree of skin fibrosis based on MRSS in SSc can predict the presence of ILD in several studies but has not been widely studied in Indonesia. This study aimed to determine the relationship of the ILD morphology based on thoracic HRCT scan with the degree of skin fibrosis based on MRSS in SSc. METHODS: This study is a retrospective analytic observational study with a cross-sectional design. The subjects of this study are SSc patients who had data of MRSS and HRCT chest scan from July 2019 to March 2020. Statistical analysis uses Spearman's correlation test. RESULTS: There were 42 study subjects, consisting of 41 women (97.6%) and one man (2.4%) with an average age of 39.50 years old (age range of 19 years to 60 years old). Correlation test results based on Spearman's show a moderate correlation between the morphological score of ILD with MRSS with R = 0.429, which is significant (p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: There is a significant moderate correlation between the morphological scores of ILD based on HRCT chest and the degree of skin fibrosis based on MRSS in SSc.","Hikmat IH, Ramdhini SS, Soekersi H, Dewi S",Acta Med Indones,2021 Jul,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
37374237,"Disentangling the Pathogenesis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: Close Ties between Immunological, Genetic and Environmental Factors.","Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease that attacks various organ systems with a variety of clinical implications, ranging from mild skin and mucosal manifestations to severe central nervous system manifestations and death. Cases of SLE have been documented nearly two centuries ago when scholars used the terms 'erythema centrifugum' and 'seborrhea congestiva' to describe the discoid skin lesions and the butterfly or malar rash in SLE. Since then, knowledge about this disease has developed rapidly, especially knowledge related to the underlying pathogenesis of SLE. To date, it is known that immune system dysregulation, supported by genetic and environmental predisposition, can trigger the occurrence of SLE in a group of susceptible individuals. Various inflammatory mediators, cytokines and chemokines, as well as intra- and intercellular signaling pathways, are involved in the pathogenesis of SLE. In this review, we will discuss the molecular and cellular aspects of SLE pathogenesis, with a focus on how the immune system, genetics and the environment interact and trigger the various clinical manifestations of SLE.","Sutanto H, Yuliasih Y",Medicina (Kaunas),2023 May 26,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
36631414,Application of forward selection strategy using C4.5 algorithm to improve the accuracy of classification's data set.,"The purpose of this study is to improve the classification accuracy of the C4.5 Algorithm utilizing the forward selection technique. Breast Cancer from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is the dataset utilized. There are 286 records in the dataset with nine attributes and one class (label). The suggested model was evaluated with two existing classification models (C4.5 and Naive Bayes) using the RapidMiner program. The procedure consists of multiple stages, the first of which consists of selecting the dominant trait using the feature selection technique (weight by information gain). The second step is forward selection based on the outcome of feature selection. Before processing, the dataset is separated into training and testing halves, where the ratios of comparison are 70:30, 80:20, and 90:10. The final step is examining the output. The experimental results demonstrate that the forward selection methodology employing the C4.5 (C4.5 + FS) method outperforms the C4.5 and Naive Bayes classification techniques. C4.5 + FS (Split Data 70:30) has an accuracy value of 76.74%, C4.5 + FS (Split Data 80:20) has an accuracy value of 78.95%, C4.5 + FS (Split Data 90:10) has an accuracy value of 78.57%, C4.5 (Split Data 70:30) has an accuracy value of 65.12%, and Naive Bayes (Split Data is 70:30) has an accuracy value 85.55%. In comparison to typical classification algorithms (C4.5 and Naive Bayes), the average accuracy values increased by 12.97% and 8.32%, respectively. In terms of precision, recall, and F-measure, the forward selection strategy utilizing the C4.5 method beat all other classification techniques, achieving 79.84%, 92.50%, and 85.55%, respectively. In addition, the results demonstrated an increase in the average Area Under Curve (AUC) from 0.628 to 0.732%. Therefore, it can be inferred that the forward selection strategy can be applied to the Breast Cancer Data Set in order to increase the accuracy value of classification method C4.5.","Kartikadarma E, Cakranegara PA, Syafar F, Iskandar A, Paramansyah A, Rahim R",J Popul Ther Clin Pharmacol,2023,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
27178630,Ethnobotanical uses of neem (Azadirachta indica A.Juss.; Meliaceae) leaves in Bali (Indonesia) and the Indian subcontinent in relation with historical background and phytochemical properties.,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Neem (Azadirachta indica; Meliaceae) is widely known for its cold pressed seed oil, mainly used as insecticide, but also for cosmetic, medicinal and agricultural uses. The seed oil is widely employed in the Indian subcontinent, and the leaves seem to have a lower relevance, but the ethnobotanical information of Bali (Indonesia) considers the utilisation of leaves for medicinal properties. AIM OF THE STUDY: We report ethnopharmacological information about current uses of neem, in particular of the leaves, besides the insecticidal one, we discuss on the historical background of their uses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethnobotanical data were collected using both literature and scientific references and semi-structured interviews with 50 informants (ages ranged between 14 and 76 years old) through the snowball method in thirteen aga (indigenous Balinese) villages, following Ethic code procedures. The informants were asked to specify: which part of the plant was used, and how that plant part was used. Plant specimens were collected, identified and made into herbarium voucher. In consideration of the high variability and complex chemical constituent of neem, a HPTLC analysis of neem leaves coming from both the Indonesian island of Bali and the Indian subcontinent was carried out. RESULTS: The data on the medical use of traditional preparations from leaves of neem display a wide spectrum of applications. In the Indian subcontinent, neem leaves are used to treat dental and gastrointestinal disorders, malaria fevers, skin diseases, and as insects repellent, while the Balinese used neem leaves as a diuretic and for diabetes, headache, heartburn, and stimulating the appetite. Differences in utilisation cannot be related to chemical differences and other constituents besides limonoids must be investigated and related to the multipurpose activity of neem. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that neem leaves are believed to treat diabetes in both Balinese and Indian communities. Limonoids can not be considered the only responsible of digestive properties. Further research would be the validation of this report by enzymatic tests and the identification of active constituents.","Sujarwo W, Keim AP, Caneva G, Toniolo C, Nicoletti M",J Ethnopharmacol,2016 Aug 2,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
37531803,The catalogue of the Westhoff collection of Chinese materia medica (c. 1870): Evidence of interaction between a Chinese medicine practitioner and the Dutch in Indonesia.,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The Westhoff collection of Chinese materia medica (c. 1870) at the Utrecht University Museum in Utrecht, the Netherlands, contains an original, handwritten catalogue, which was putatively ascribed to a Chinese medicine practitioner. It provides a detailed record of the Chinese names, plant parts, preparations, and applications of the specimens contained in glass bottles, which probably reflects the physician's personal interpretation of Chinese medicine in Indonesia at the end of the 19th century. Such individual catalogues can reveal historical changes and regional variations in the use of traditional Chinese medicine, which can lead to a better understanding of the history and development of this field. AIM OF THE STUDY: We addressed the following questions: 1) What are the contents of the Westhoff catalogue? 2) What medicinal preparations and applications were recorded in the catalogue, and which ones are dominant? 3) How similar is the use of Chinese materia medica in Westhoff catalogue compared to the modern Chinese Pharmacopeia? 4) What other specific information is contained in the Westhoff catalogue? MATERIALS AND METHODS: The catalogue had been digitized previously, and all handwritten Dutch text has been transcribed and translated into English. The information for each entry was summarized and analyzed, the medicinal applications were compared to modern Chinese pharmacopeia or other monographs on Chinese materia medica. RESULTS: The catalogue contains 436 entries, for which 395 corresponding specimens still exist in the Westhoff collection of Chinese materia medica. Each entry contains a serial number, a Chinese name, a phonetic Dutch transcription of the Chinese name, a description of the plant, animal, or mineral origin of the medicinal product, the preparation method, and the medical indication for which it should be used. The dominant preparation method is decoction (79% of the entries). The most frequently mentioned applications are fever, skin diseases, strengthening and wounds. Around 80% of the medicinal applications in the catalogue were also listed for the same CMM in modern monographs. The catalogue also sheds light on typical characteristics of popular medicine, their geographic origin, and social aspects of traditional Chinese medicine in Indonesia around 1870. CONCLUSIONS: The Westhoff catalogue is a valuable record of Chinese materia medica and its practice in a specific time and space. It reflects an individual physician's interpretation of Chinese medicine, shows the difficulties in the interpretation of cultural-bound health issues between the Dutch and the Chinese, and provides evidence that traditional Chinese medicine spread not only in East Asia but also to the distant Western world.","Jia Y, Wang M, Lambers PH, van Andel T",J Ethnopharmacol,2024 Jan 10,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
39471018,BRAF and NRAS Mutations and the Association with Prognosis of Acral Lentiginous and Nodular Melanomas in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Melanomas are rare yet the most aggressive skin cancer among Asians. Clinical presentation, risk factors, and the underlying molecular mechanisms are strikingly different from cutaneous melanoma in Caucasians. METHODS: Mutation patterns of BRAF and NRAS genes were examined from DNAs derived from primary melanoma tumor tissues (fresh tissues or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples) using pyrosequencing. RESULTS: A total of 63 patients consisting of acral lentiginous melanoma (N=22, 34.9%) and nodular melanoma (N=41, 65.1%) were included in this study. Most patients were diagnosed at Stage III-IV (N=49, 77.8%), Breslow thickness more than 4 mm (N=51, 80.9%), presence of ulceration (N=35, 55.6%), diameter larger than 6 mm (N=61, 96.8%), regional node infiltration (N=41, 77.8%). BRAF and NRAS mutations were found in 28 (44.4%) and 8 (12.7%), respectively. BRAF and NRAS mutations were significantly associated with older melanoma patients (OR = 6.075, 95%CI = 2.013-18.333 dan OR = 13.263, 95%CI = 1.518-115.901, respectively). BRAF mutations were associated with lower overall survival (Median survivals were 16.5 vs 31.4 months, Log-rank test P=0.001). NRAS mutations were not significantly associated with lower overall survival. CONCLUSION: In this study, melanoma patients are largely diagnosed at the late stages with ulceration and involvement of regional lymph nodes. BRAF mutations are associated with lower survival of cutaneous melanoma patients.","Anwar SL, Ferronika P, Cahyono R, Sugandhi W, Pradana GD",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,2024 Oct 1,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia

There are different treatment guidelines per country in the region, and a group of leading dermatologists from these countries convened to review these guidelines, discuss current practices and recent advances, and formulate consensus guidelines to harmonize the management of acne vulgaris in the region. Emphasis has been placed on formulating recommendations to impede the development of antibiotic resistance in Propionibacterium acnes. The group adopted the Acne Consensus Conference system for grading acne severity. The group recommends that patients may be treated with topical medications including retinoids, benzoyl peroxide (BPO), salicylic acid, a combination of retinoid and BPO, or a combination of retinoids and BPO with or without antibiotics for mild acne; topical retinoid with topical BPO and a oral antibiotic for moderate acne; and oral isotretinoin if the patient fails first-line treatment (a 6- or 8-week trial of combined oral antibiotics and topical retinoids with BPO) for severe acne. Maintenance acne treatment using topical retinoids with or without BPO is recommended. To prevent the development of antibiotic resistance, topical antibiotics should not be used as monotherapy or used simultaneously with oral antibiotics. Skin care, comprised of cleansing, moisturizing and sun protection, is likewise recommended. Patient education and good communication is recommended to improve adherence, and advice should be given about the characteristics of the skin care products patients should use.","Goh CL, Abad-Casintahan F, Aw DC, Baba R, Chan LC, Hung NT, Kulthanan K, Leong HN, Medina-Oblepias MS, Noppakun N, Sitohang IB, Sugito TL, Wong SN",J Dermatol,2015 Oct,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
31508854,Analysis of Internet searches using Google Trends to measure interest in sun protection and skin cancer in selected South-East Asian populations.,"BACKGROUND: Analysis of Internet search trends has been performed to evaluate interest in sun protection, artificial tanning, and skin cancers among the public, particularly in Western countries. This observational study aimed to investigate the relative popularity of search terms relating to sun protection, sunburn, skin cancers, and tanning used in Google Trends(R) in three South-East Asian countries (Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia). METHODS: The relevant search terms were queried using the Google Trends(R) in each location and worldwide. The search volume indices were compared between locations and over a time period from January 1, 2004, to January 31, 2019. Correlations between ""sunblock"" and ""sunburn"" as well as ""sunblock"" and search terms relating to skin cancers (""skin cancer,"" ""melanoma,"" ""basal cell carcinoma,"" and ""squamous cell carcinoma"") were evaluated. RESULTS: The favored search term relating to sun protection in this region was ""sunblock"" despite the term itself being a misnomer. The relative popularity of searches for ""sunblock"" also showed an increase over time and was generally higher compared with interest in sunburn, skin cancers, and artificial tanning practices. Positive correlations were noted between ""sunblock"" and ""sunburn"" in Malaysia and ""sunblock"" and ""melanoma"" in Singapore. CONCLUSION: Insights into search trends may assist public health promotion to raise awareness regarding sun protection and skin cancers in the region by targeting commonly used terms for each geographical location.","Kwan Z, Yong SS, Robinson S",Photodermatol Photoimmunol Photomed,2020 Mar,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
38796284,"Pan-Asian adapted ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with early breast cancer.","The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Clinical Practice Guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with early breast cancer were updated and published online in 2023, and adapted, according to previously established standard methodology, to produce the Pan-Asian adapted (PAGA) ESMO consensus guidelines for the management of Asian patients with early breast cancer. The adapted guidelines presented in this manuscript represent the consensus opinions reached by a panel of Asian experts in the treatment of patients with breast cancer representing the oncological societies of China (CSCO), Indonesia (ISHMO), India (ISMPO), Japan (JSMO), Korea (KSMO), Malaysia (MOS), the Philippines (PSMO), Singapore (SSO), Taiwan (TOS) and Thailand (TSCO), co-ordinated by ESMO and KSMO. The voting was based on scientific evidence and was independent of the current treatment practices, drug access restrictions and reimbursement decisions in the different Asian regions represented by the 10 oncological societies. The latter are discussed separately in the manuscript. The aim is to provide guidance for the optimisation and harmonisation of the management of patients with early breast cancer across the different regions of Asia, drawing on the evidence provided by both Western and Asian trials, whilst respecting the differences in screening practices, molecular profiling, as well as the age and stage at presentation. Attention is drawn to the disparity in the drug approvals and reimbursement strategies, between the different regions of Asia.","Park KH, Loibl S, Sohn J, Park YH, Jiang Z, Tadjoedin H, Nag S, Saji S, Md Yusof M, Villegas EMB, Lim EH, Lu YS, Ithimakin S, Tseng LM, Dejthevaporn T, Chen TW, Lee SC, Galvez C, Malwinder S, Kogawa T, Bajpai J, Brahma B, Wang S, Curigliano G, Yoshino T, Kim SB, Pentheroudakis G, Im SA, Andre F, Ahn JB, Harbeck N",ESMO Open,2024 May,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
33690216,Exfoliative dermatitis due to dermatophytosis.,"Exfoliative dermatitis (ED) or erythroderma is defined as diffuse erythema and scaling of the skin involving more than 90% of the total body skin surface, which can be caused by variety of systemic and cutaneous diseases, such as infection, including dermatophytosis. Dermatophytosis is a superficial fungal infection of keratinized tissue caused by dermatophytes. There are only few case reports of ED due to dermatophytosis in literature. A 39-year-old male present with history of diffuse erythematous macules and scales almost on entire body due to dermatophytosis was reported. The diagnosis of dermatophytosis was confirmed by direct microscopic examination, fungal culture, and histopathological examination. Patient was treated with 2% ketoconazole shampoo and two pulses of 1-week of 200 mg itraconazole twice a day for each month. Clinical improvement was showed on the 7th day of observation characterized by decreasing of erythematous macules and scales. Mycological and clinical improvements were obtained on the 29th day of observation. The etiology of ED should be determined in order to give an appropiate treatment.","Hidayah RMN, Anjani AD, Ramali LM, Suwarsa O, Gunawan H",J Infect Dev Ctries,2021 Mar 7,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
25850453,[Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome].,"BACKGROUND: Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome is rare in the Netherlands. However, in Asia it is one of the most common causes of panuveitis. The syndrome is characterised by a combination of panuveitis, pleocytosis in cerebral spinal fluid with or without neurological function loss, alopecia and depigmentation of body hair. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 40-year-old male with no previous medical history visited the emergency department with unexplained bilateral visual symptoms and optic disc swelling. In addition to the latter, further tests only showed pleocytosis in cerebral spinal fluid. In the months following the initial presentation, vision was restored but the patient developed panuveitis, extensive depigmentation, and loss of body hair. On further investigation, the patient reported having a great-grandfather from Indonesia. CONCLUSION: Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome should be considered in patients of Asian descent presenting with panuveitis, alopecia and depigmentation of body hair. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent permanent visual injury.","van Velzen GA, Verwer KM, Rothova A, Gilhuis HJ",Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd,2015,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
37605227,"Combination of adipose-derived stem cell conditioned media and minoxidil for hair regrowth in male androgenetic alopecia: a randomized, double-blind clinical trial.","INTRODUCTION: Treatments for AGA have yet to produce satisfactory outcomes and may cause intolerable side effects. Recent studies have reported that adipose tissue-derived stem cell conditioned media (ADSC-CM) could induce hair growth and regeneration. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of ADSC-CM combined with minoxidil for hair regeneration therapy in male AGA. METHODS: This study lasted for 6 weeks. Subjects were divided into two groups: concentrated and non-concentrated ADSC-CM. Scalp was divided vertically in half before intradermal injection was administered from the frontal region of the scalp toward the vertex with a 30G needle, spaced about 1 cm apart. Treatment side received 2 ml of ADSC-CM; the other side was given 2 ml of NaCl 0.9% as placebo. Patients applied 5% minoxidil twice daily post-injection. Improvements were assessed using photographs and trichoscan every 2 weeks. RESULTS: Hair count, hair density, and mean thickness increased significantly on both sides after 6 weeks, while vellus rate decreased proportionally with the increase of terminal rate. No statistically significant differences between treatment groups were found. Minimum side effects were reported, and subjects were satisfied with the results. CONCLUSION: Combination of ADSC-CM and minoxidil could be a potential agent for hair regrowth. Follow-up research with extensive populations, longer duration, and different study design may be required to confirm the exact mechanisms of ADSC-CM on hair growth.

38059515,Awareness of sun exposure risks and photoprotection for preventing pigmentary disorders in Asian populations: Survey results from three Asian countries and expert panel recommendations.,"BACKGROUND: In this article, we review and discuss the photoprotection behavior of Asians based on the literature, along with a subanalysis of an original online survey, and make recommendations to optimize photoprotection for Asian populations to prevent photoaging and pigmentary disorders. METHODS: An international panel of eight dermatologists from Asia (China, Korea, Japan, Singapore, Indonesia, and Vietnam) met to discuss sunscreen photoprotection for Asian patients. Additionally, a subanalysis of an online survey by 3000 respondents from three Asian countries (China, Indonesia, and Japan) investigated general public awareness and attitudes to sun exposure. RESULTS: A pre-meeting survey of the eight experts from Asia showed key concerns of Asian patients consulting dermatologists are pigmentary disorders, especially actinic/senile lentigo, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, melasma, vitiligo, and Hori's nevus. The survey subanalysis of participants from China, Indonesia, and Japan with predominantly Fitzpatrick skin types (FST) II to IV revealed that they are particularly concerned about sun exposure causing photoaging and pigmentary disorders. Most of the respondents indicated they have limited knowledge on sunlight radiation and appropriate sunscreen protection factors. Only 22%, 13%, and 3% for China, Indonesia, and Japan, respectively, systematically use multiple protective measures (using sunscreen, avoiding midday sun, staying in the shade, wearing a hat, protective clothing, and sunglasses) when exposed to the sun. CONCLUSIONS: Further education is needed for Asian populations on the importance of comprehensive daily photoprotection, including broad-spectrum sunscreen, with high UVA and visible light protection, to reduce and prevent photoaging and pigmentary disorders.","Goh CL, Kang HY, Morita A, Zhang C, Wu Y, Prakoeswa CRS, Sau NH, Kerob D, Flament F, Wei L",Photodermatol Photoimmunol Photomed,2024 Jan,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
39865052,Cutaneous Anthrax: What is the Hallmark?,"A 71-year-old man complained of a blackish wound under his left eye, which began with fever and reddish spots after helping to slaughter a cow and cut its meat. The fever occured especially in the afternoon to evening, and is not accompanied by chills and sweating. On day 4 of fever onset, the fever diminished and the spots progressively widened with swelling. On day 7, the lesions on the skin became open wounds that were not purulent and did not bleed. On day 9, a blackish, painless layer appeared over the wounds and widened, further covering their surface. Upon presentation, the patient's general condition was good, with normal vital signs and temperature. He presented with a solitary ulcer accompanied by edema, sized 1 cm x 3 cm, not hyperemic, firm border, flat edge, and covered with blackish eschar. Blood tests revealed normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocyte, platelets, kidney and liver function. The anti-anthrax protective antigen (anti-PA) IgG level is found to be seropositive with a level of 85 U/ml. Gram staining of the tissue underneath the eschar found Gram-positive rod bacteria in reddish-purple color. The patient was clinically diagnosed with probable cutaneous anthrax, and was treated with amoxicillin 500 mg orally t.i.d. for three days and paracetamol 500 mg if fever developed. The tissue sample was sent to a laboratory with Bio Safety level 3 facilities for microbiological culture, with the results of Bacillus anthracis growth. On day three after antibiotic administration, the wound was smaller (0.5 cm x 1.5 cm), firm border, flat edge, with a bit of edema above it. The eschar was thickened, painless, not purulent nor bleeding. Antibiotic administration is continued for another three days with amoxicillin 500 mg orally t.i.d. On day 6 of antibiotic administration, the eschar began to peel off, and antibiotics were stopped. On the 10th day, the eschar peeled off entirely without leaving a mark. Early diagnosis is crucial in preventing the spread that may lead to more cases. Clinical and serological examinations are the spearheads of early detection of anthrax cases. Prompt and appropriate management largely determines the success of therapy.","Harioputro DR, Kusumawardani A, Novita I, Nurhayatun E, Tunjungputri RN, Nelwan EJ",Acta Med Indones,2024 Oct,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
12040112,Effluents from a pulp and paper mill: a skin and health survey of children living in upstream and downstream villages.,"OBJECTIVES: A health survey of three villages (upstream village Rantau Baru and two downstream villages, Sering and Pelalawan) in the vicinity of a pulp and paper mill along the Kampar river in the province of Riau, Indonesia was conducted to find whether exposure to the effluents from the mill was related to skin conditions and ill health. METHODS: A cross sectional survey was carried out of children living in the three villages. RESULTS: Common skin conditions such as dermatitis, fungal infections, insect bites, and miliaria were found. No significantly increased risk of dermatitis or any illness in general was found with increasing levels of exposure to river water for downstream villages when compared with the upstream village. However, there was an increased risk of diarrhoea in Sering especially with drinking water directly from the river (prevalence rate ratio (PRR) 4.9, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.4 to 63.9). An increased risk was also found within the upstream village Rantau Baru (PRR 2.3, 95% CI 0.9 to 5.8) and downstream village Sering (PRR 1.4, 95% CI 0.4 to 5.2) when children who drank water directly from the river were compared with those who never did. Analysis of the river water also showed physical and chemical variables within the acceptable range except for faecal coliforms (6 MPN/100 ml) found in the sample taken from Sering. CONCLUSIONS: The effluent from the mill is unlikely to be causing skin conditions and ill health. Diarrhoea may be due to faecal coliform contamination of the water because all raw sewerage is deposited in the river. Community health outreach programmes are being implemented based on these findings.","Lee J, Koh D, Andijani M, Saw SM, Munoz C, Chia SE, Wong ML, Hong CY, Ong CN",Occup Environ Med,2002 Jun,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
33567996,Body Image as a Mediator Between Gender and Quality of Life Among Patients With Diabetic Foot Ulcers in Indonesia.,"INTRODUCTION: Foot ulcers cause women in Indonesia to lose opportunities to participate in religious and cultural activities due to the inability to wear certain footwear. This study examined body image as a mediator in the relationship between gender and quality of life (QoL) among patients with diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) in Indonesia. METHOD: A cross-sectional design with convenience sampling was used to recruit participants at the Surgical Outpatient Department and Wound Care Clinic in Bali, Indonesia. The Diabetic Foot Ulcer Scale-Short Form and the body image domain of the Body Investment Scale were administered. RESULTS: We found gender differences in participants' (n = 201) QoL and body image (p < .05). Body image fully mediated the effect of the relationship between gender and QoL (B = 6.68; 95% confidence interval [3.14, 10.52]) and explained 39.13% of the variance. DISCUSSION: Health care providers should consider patients' religious beliefs in DFU education and consider women's body image issues. Diabetes foot ulcer may prevent women from performing religious rituals, thus, influencing their QoL. Protective strategies to prevent DFU among women in Indonesia warrant further development.","Putri NMME, Yasmara D, Yen MF, Pan SC, Fang SY",J Transcult Nurs,2021 Nov,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
11321446,Pathophysiology of microcirculation in venous disease.,"Microcirculatory disturbances lead to chronic ulceration of the leg, and this symptom is a sign of a chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), caused by increased leg vein pressure and continous changes in vein pressure, which need medical treatment, and if a chronic capillary reaction present, treatment by applying a graduated compression bandage of the leg is mandatory. Subcutaneous tissue hypoxaemia and interstitial edema lead to worsening of the ulcer and need intensive and systematic wound care, because unhealed chronic wound with trophic changes of the skin is the major cause of further CVI changes of the leg. As chronic venous disease has complex etiologic basis, it needs diagnostics and treatment modality based on various approaches, and that microcirculatory pathophysiological approach should be considered in all kinds of the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency. Microcirculation pathology should be used as an approach in the treatment regiment of CVI, whilst the basic pathophysiology of the venous diseases, which is known as one of the causes of CVI.

29882991,Potential cutaneous carcinogenic risk of exposure to UV nail lamp: A review.,"The increased use of ultraviolet (UV) nail lamps in recent years has generated safety concerns of this device. A UV nail lamp is a source of artificial UVA radiation, often used to dry, harden, and cure the nails at home and in the salon. UVA radiation is known to be mutagenic and can cause damage to the DNA, resulting in cutaneous malignancy. Currently, there are only a few studies that have evaluated UV nail lamp irradiation and its potential carcinogenic risk. We review the literature on UV nail lamps, its safety, effect on nails and hands, and the potential role in increasing the risk of cutaneous malignancy. Based on available data, the carcinogenic risk is low; nonetheless, the use of a broad spectrum sunscreen with SPF >30 before UV nail lamp exposure is recommended.","Shihab N, Lim HW",Photodermatol Photoimmunol Photomed,2018 Nov,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
34049578,Potential prognostic value of PD-L1 and NKG2A expression in Indonesian patients with skin nodular melanoma.,"OBJECTIVE: Biomarker mRNA levels have been suggested to be predictors of patient survival and therapy response in melanoma cases. This study aimed to investigate the correlations between the mRNA expression levels of PD-L1 and NKG2A in melanoma tissue with clinicopathologic characteristics and survival in Indonesian primary nodular melanoma patients. RESULTS: Thirty-one tissue samples were obtained; two were excluded from survival analysis due to Breslow depth of less than 4 mm. The median survival of upregulated and normoregulated PD-L1-patients were 15.800 +/- 2.345 and 28.945 +/- 4.126 months, respectively. However, this difference was not significant statistically (p = 0.086). Upregulated and normoregulated NKG2A patients differed very little in median survival time (25.943 +/- 7.415 vs 26.470 +/- 3.854 months; p = 0.981). Expression of PD-L1 and NKG2A were strongly correlated (r(s): 0.787, p < 0.001). No clinicopathologic associations with PD-L1 and NKG2A mRNA levels were observed. These results suggest that PD-L1 may have potential as a prognostic factor. Although an unlikely prognostic factor, NKG2A may become an adjunct target for therapy. The strong correlation between PD-L1 and NKG2A suggests that anti-PD-1 and anti-NKG2A agents could be effective in patients with PD-L1 upregulation. The mRNA levels of these two genes may help direct choice of immunotherapy and predict patient outcomes.","Saputro RD, Rinonce HT, Iramawasita Y, Ridho MR, Pudjohartono MF, Anwar SL, Setiaji K, Aryandono T",BMC Res Notes,2021 May 28,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
39737182,The translational potential of inflammation-induced skin blister human models in exploring the pathogenesis of periodontitis and its systemic health implications.,"Periodontitis is a highly prevalent chronic disease. Despite decades of extensive research on the topic, a complete understanding of its immunopathogenesis, especially when linked to other inflammatory comorbidities, is lacking. Ex vivo human and in vivo animal experiments have shown the host inflammatory response's crucial role in both the disease's onset and its systemic implications. These approaches, however, remain questionable when translating these findings into real-world scenarios linked to periodontitis. A clear need for new in vivo human models is discussed, especially within the context of understanding the host response to key pathogens linked to periodontitis, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis). Therefore, a skin blister model was employed to describe the stages of the host immune response in humans after challenges by microbial and/or sterile insults. A novel human challenge model using UV-killed P. gingivalis holds promise in producing new evidence and bridging the gap of the host response to periodontitis and its links with other common chronic diseases.","Irwandi RA, Marruganti C, Collins G, Carvalho JS, Gilroy D, D'Aiuto F",Front Immunol,2024,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia

Previous studies indicate that the geographic factor has influence on the main species isolated from PV. Our aim was to identify Malassezia spp. from PV patients in Indonesia and their correlation to clinical characteristics. Isolates of Malassezia were collected from 98 PV patients (62 males and 36 females). Identification was based on morphological observation and biochemical evaluation. Leeming Notman agar was used as isolation culture medium. The biochemical evaluation consisted of specimen culture onto Sabouraud dextrose agar, Cremophor EL, Esculin, Dixon's agar at 37 degrees C and catalase reaction. The isolates found were Malasseziafurfur (42.9%), M. sympodialis (27.5%), M. globosa (13.3%), M. slooffiae (7.7%), M. obtusa (7.7%) and M. restricta (2.2%), and 7.14% specimens were unidentified. There was no statistically significant association between Malassezia spp. and demographic characteristics and clinical characteristics of the patients. Unlike reports from temperate climate countries, this study in Indonesia found M. furfur as the most frequently isolated Malassezia spp. in PV patients.","Krisanty RI, Bramono K, Made Wisnu I",Mycoses,2009 May,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia

A massive vaccination program is being implemented worldwide to suppress this condition. Several works of literature stated that mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, specifically with the mRNA-1273 vaccine, is followed by clear evidence of the COVID arm effects associated with this vaccine. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the latest evidence of COVID arm as a common effect of mRNA-1273 vaccination with the ultimate goal of improving vaccine counseling to help healthcare professionals and reassure patients. METHODS: A comprehensive search was performed on topics that assess the COVID arm as a cutaneous manifestation following mRNA-1273 vaccination from inception up until July 2022. RESULTS: Eighteen studies with a total of 1129 participants after the first and second dose of mRNA-1273 vaccination reported that most participants had COVID arm following the first dose administration. The characteristics of the patients were a mean age of 43.8 years old, and females represented >/= 50% in most studies, with a mean onset of 6.9 days after the first dose administration. Symptoms resolved within seven days following the treatment and were harmless. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that the COVID arm condition is most common following the first mRNA-1273 vaccination in the female and middle-aged group. The correlation between demographic variables and COVID arm risk elucidates that the reaction is a type IV allergic skin reaction.","Agustin M, Trifitriana M, Danarti R",BMC Infect Dis,2023 Jan 6,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
38261764,"Association Between Health Service Systems and Pressure Injury Problems of Individuals With Chronic Spinal Cord Injury in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand: A Cross-sectional Study.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to determine whether a health service system is an independent influencing factor of having pressure injury problems in individuals with chronic spinal cord injury living in three countries. DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study. METHODS: Data from the International Spinal Cord Injury Community Survey were analyzed. The pressure injury problems were assessed using the Spinal Cord Injury Secondary Condition Scales (dichotomized to ""having problem"" and ""not having problem""). Health service systems were categorized as an inpatient-oriented spinal cord injury-specialized system and a primary care-oriented system. A directed acyclic graph was applied to create a multivariable logistic regression model to determine the independent influencing factors of pressure injury problems. RESULTS: Of 790 included participants, 277 (35%) had pressure injury problems. Being recruited from countries with inpatient-oriented spinal cord injury-specialized systems (model 1) and visiting rehabilitation medicine/spinal cord injury physicians at least once a year (model 2) is an independent negative correlating factor of pressure injury problems (odds ratio = 0.569 [95% confidence interval = 0.374-0.866] and 0.591 [95% confidence interval = 0.405-0.864], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Spinal cord injury-specialized health service systems might be a protective factor of pressure injury problems in middle-income country contexts.

37340026,Transcriptomics-driven drug repositioning for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcer.,"Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a common complication of diabetes and can lead to severe disability and even amputation. Despite advances in treatment, there is currently no cure for DFUs and available drugs for treatment are limited. This study aimed to identify new candidate drugs and repurpose existing drugs to treat DFUs based on transcriptomics analysis. A total of 31 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and used to prioritize the biological risk genes for DFUs. Further investigation using the database DGIdb revealed 12 druggable target genes among 50 biological DFU risk genes, corresponding to 31 drugs. Interestingly, we highlighted that two drugs (urokinase and lidocaine) are under clinical investigation for DFU and 29 drugs are potential candidates to be repurposed for DFU therapy. The top 5 potential biomarkers for DFU from our findings are IL6ST, CXCL9, IL1R1, CXCR2, and IL10. This study highlights IL1R1 as a highly promising biomarker for DFU due to its high systemic score in functional annotations, that can be targeted with an existing drug, Anakinra. Our study proposed that the integration of transcriptomic and bioinformatic-based approaches has the potential to drive drug repurposing for DFUs. Further research will further examine the mechanisms by which targeting IL1R1 can be used to treat DFU.","Adikusuma W, Zakaria ZA, Irham LM, Nopitasari BL, Pradiningsih A, Firdayani F, Septama AW, Chong R",Sci Rep,2023 Jun 20,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
16898911,Skin problems after a tsunami.,"BACKGROUND: On December 26, 2004, the biggest earthquake for 40 years, measuring 9.0 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami that pounded the coastal areas of South Asia and East Africa. The effects of the tsunami on skin conditions have not been evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To determine the influence of the tsunami on skin conditions by evaluating the skin problems of patients presenting at hospitals after the tsunami. METHODS: Between 5 and 25 January 2005, two dermatologists evaluated patients who complained of skin problems at an outpatient clinic and emergency room of a general hospital in Banda Aceh, Aceh Province, Indonesia. RESULTS: The total number of patients that presented during the study period was 235 (131 males and 104 females), and they had a total of 265 skin problems. In terms of age distribution, most subjects were in their fourth decade (23.0%), followed by the third (22.6%) and fifth decade (16.6%). The most prevalent skin problems were infections-infestations (32.5%), followed by eczemas (29.8%) and traumatic skin disorders (29.4%). In males, traumatic skin disorders were most common. The great majority of infection-infestation cases involved superficial fungal infections. Contact dermatitis accounted for three-quarters of eczema cases, and mainly involved the arms (40.0%) and legs (27.1%). The majority of traumatic skin disorders were lacerations, punctures and penetrations, and the feet (44.7%) and hands (18.8%) were most frequently affected. CONCLUSIONS: Unhygienic conditions, exposure to a hazardous environment and contact with various objects during and after the tsunami probably increased the prevalence of infections-infestations, traumatic skin disorders and contact dermatitis. To prevent these problems and associated secondary bacterial infections, health-related education and early medical management are required.","Lee SH, Choi CP, Eun HC, Kwon OS",J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,2006 Aug,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
13106702,Infant malnutrition in Indonesia.,"Infant malnutrition, resulting frequently in the death of children of pre-school age, is a problem requiring urgent solution in Indonesia. Children suffering from malnutrition show a variety of symptoms, the most characteristic being emaciation, growth retardation, liver changes, dyspigmentation of skin and hair, other skin lesions, oedema, muscular wasting, anaemia, and xerophthalmia. The indicative value of xerophthalmia, which often leads to the development of keratomalacia, in the diagnosis of malnutrition is stressed by the author. Further research is required to determine the causes-and particularly the part played by diet-of the clinical differences observed in malnutrition cases. Far greater interest in the problem of malnutrition must be shown by the entire medical profession in Indonesia if treatment is to be carried out successfully. The specific symptom, xerophthalmia, is easily curable with cod-liver oil. General malnutrition can be prevented only if sufficient amounts, both quantitatively and qualitatively, of protein, vitamin A, and calories are provided for every child. The Indonesian must be taught, by practical example, the necessity of adequate feeding, and be encouraged to make maximum use of locally available foods. It is hoped that the centres to deal with malnutrition, envisaged by the Ministry of Health, will provide both curative and preventive treatment and facilities for propaganda and research.",OOMEN HA,Bull World Health Organ,1953,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia
36647686,"Comparison of vitamin D levels in diabetes mellitus patients with and without diabetic foot ulcers: An analytical observational study in Jakarta, Indonesia.","Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a form of chronic wound which becomes a serious complication in diabetes mellitus (DM). Recently, the role of vitamin D on T cell-mediated immunity, pancreatic insulin secretion, and its mechanism on cell growth and healing processes have been reported. This study aims to compare the vitamin D level of DM patients with DFU and without DFU to assess the duration and severity of DFU and its correlation with vitamin D levels. The sociodemographic characteristics and DFU duration were documented. The severity was examined in accordance with PEDIS classification. 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) was analysed using in-vitro chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA). Statistical analysis was performed and the P-value <.05 was considered as statistically significant. The vitamin D levels in DM patients with and without DFU were 8.90 ng/mL (6.52-10.90) and 16.25 ng/mL (13-19.59), respectively, with P < .001. There was no correlation between the duration of DFU and DFU severity by PEDIS score with vitamin D levels. Vitamin D levels in DM patients with DFU are lower than those in patients without DFU. However, there was insufficient evidence to conclude that there is no correlation between the DFU duration and DFU severity by PEDIS score with vitamin D levels.","Priyanto MH, Legiawati L, Saldi SRF, Yunir E, Miranda E",Int Wound J,2023 Aug,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia

38829483,"Effectiveness of topical hyaluronic acid of different molecular weights in xerosis cutis treatment in elderly: a double-blind, randomized controlled trial.","Dry skin is a common dermatological condition that frequently affects the elderly. A contributing cause to dry skin is a reduced concentration of hyaluronic acid (HA) in both the epidermis and dermis. The effectiveness of moisturizer containing HA as a therapy for dry skin is impacted by its specific molecular weight. Low molecular weight HA (LMWHA) is believed to be more effective in replenishing skin hydration in aging skin compared to High Molecular Weight HA (HMWHA) due to its ability to penetrate the stratum corneum. However, there is a lack of clinical research supporting this claim. A double-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted on 36 residents of a nursing home in Jakarta. The participants, aged between 60 and 80 years, had been diagnosed with dry skin. Each test subject was administered three distinct, randomized moisturizing lotions (LMWHA, HMWHA, or vehicle), to be topically applied to three separate sites on the leg. Skin capacitance (SCap), transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and specified symptom sum score (SRRC) were measured at weeks 0, 2, and 4. After four weeks of therapy, area that was treated with LMWHA showed greater SCap values compared to the area treated with HMWHA (56.37 AU vs. 52.37 AU, p = 0.004) and vehicle (56.37 AU vs. 49.01 AU, p < 0.001). All groups did not show any significant differences in TEWL and SRRC scores. No side effects were found in all groups. The application of a moisturizer containing LMWHA to the dry skin of elderly resulted in significant improvements in skin hydration compared to moisturizers containing HMWHA and vehicle. Furthermore, these moisturizers demonstrated similar safety in treating dry skin in the elderly.

Although may occur in any skin types, PAH has been found to be more common and severe in people with colored skin. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of combination serum containing galactomyces ferment filtrate (GFF), dexpanthenol, and Centella asiatica for treating PAH. This randomized controlled clinical trial involved Fitzpatrick skin type (FST) IV and V patients with PAH. Subjects were equally divided into treatment group, who received three drops of combination serum twice daily for 8 weeks, and placebo group. The melanin index (MI) and Lightness (L*) score were assessed every 2 weeks. Out of 51 subjects, the L* score of the treatment group in subjects with FST V was significantly higher on the 4th and 6th week compared to the placebo group (P < 0.05). The MI of subjects with FST IV was significantly lower compared to the placebo group after 8 weeks (P < 0.05). The treatment group showed consistent increasing and decreasing trend in L* score and MI, respectively (r > 0.9, P < 0.05). Combination serum containing GFF, dexpanthenol, and C. asiatica may be effective in treating PAH in subjects with colored skin by accelerating lessening of PAH.","Anwar AI, Adriani A, Rimayani S, Anwar AA, Seweng A, Munirah R, Dewi WS, Kurniadi I",Skinmed,2021,Skin Diseases AND Indonesia

Surabaya has become a government regional reference center, as it is the capital of East Java province, which has the highest rate of diphtheria across the 38 regions. The aim of this study is to report our six-year pediatric diphtheria data, focusing on comparisons between before and during the pandemic era. Method This surveillance report was collected from community health centers and hospitals throughout Surabaya from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2022. Collected data included demographic characteristics, clinical and laboratory aspects, the health centers, immunization history, and management. As per Indonesian guidelines, the diagnosis of diphtheria in this country requires a positive microbiological culture or approval from the National Experts on Diphtheria Committee. Results In total, there were 112 cases, of which 89 were found before the pandemic era. Although the number of cases declined during 2020-2022, the predominant age group, the immunization status, and the most common type of diphtheria remained consistent with pre-pandemic trends. Most cases had incomplete immunization or unimmunized children (67.8%), with the age group of 5-12 years old (44.6%), and with tonsillar diphtheria (83%). The case fatality ratio was 1.8%. Regarding the biovar of Corynebacterium diphtheriae, gravis is the most frequent finding. Conclusion The incidence of diphtheria cases in children in Surabaya was significantly lower during the pandemic. Although immunization coverage was not better, preventive measures during the pandemic may have played a role. Most patients did not have complete immunization histories during the study period, and the predominant type was tonsillar diphtheria. Since the trend in 2021-2022 increased, routine surveillance is essential.","Husada D, Nuringhati KW, Tindage SG, Mustikasari RI, Kartina L, Puspitasari D, Basuki PS, Moedjito I, Yuliandari RD, Sukristina N",Cureus,2024 Aug,Diphtheria AND Indonesia

31699943,Diphtheria Epidemiology in Indonesia during 2010-2017.,"BACKGROUND: in recent years, diphtheria has reemerged in several countries including Venezuela, Yemen, Bangladesh, and Haiti. Similarly, Indonesia also showed an increased number of diphtheria cases in 2010-2017 despite the Diphteria, Tetanus, Pertussis (DTP) immunization program applied in Indonesia for children. This study aimed to evaluate the epidemiology of diphtheria cases which occurred in Indonesia during 2010-2017. METHODS: this was a retrospective study of diphtheria cases in Indonesia. The following source of data about diphtheria disease burden and vaccine coverage was obtained from Ministry of Health Republic of Indonesia, Indonesian Pediatric Society and World Health Organization South East Asia Regional Office. RESULTS: the number of diphtheria cases in Indonesia were distributed across 30 provinces with a total of 811 cases in 2011; 1,192 cases in 2012; 296 cases in 2014; and 939 cases in 2017. Based on age group, the highest number of case fatality rate were in age group of 5-9 years old. Diphtheria immunization coverage in Indonesia among children was fluctuated, reported as 67.7 % in 2007, 61.9 % in 2010, 75.6% in 2013 and 61.3% in 2018. In addition to that, the organization of internal medicine has recommend booster of DPT immunization every 10 years for those children that had received complete DPT vaccination during childhood, however this was not applied. As the countermeasure towards this trend, the Ministry of Health implemented three rounds of Outbreak Response Immunization (ORI) targeted for the age group of 0-1-6 months old and 1-18 years old in 2017 and tailor approached for adults that had exposed to cases. Banten, DKI Jakarta and West Java were the first three provinces to implement this program considering their condensed population and high risk of disease transmission. CONCLUSION: in Indonesia, there was dramatic increase of diphtheria case in 2010-2017, where immunization in children should be reinforced by increasing coverage more than 95% and adult boosted vaccination approaches should be initiated to prevent the spread of these fatal diphtheria diseases in Indonesia.","Karyanti MR, Nelwan EJ, Assyidiqie IZ, Satari HI, Hadinegoro SR",Acta Med Indones,2019 Jul,Diphtheria AND Indonesia

There was a need to assess vaccine coverage and immunity gaps in children. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence and vaccine coverage survey of children 1-15 years of age in 2 districts of East Java: one of high incidence (on the island of Madura) and one of low incidence (on the mainland). From each district, we sampled 150 children (10 children per year of age). Sera and throat swabs were taken to determine immunity and carriage status. Immunity was defined as >/=0.1 international unit/mL of antibody to diphtheria toxin. RESULTS: A total of 297 children were selected to participate in the study. Coverage of three doses of combined vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis was significantly lower (P < 0.001) in the high incidence district compared with the low [57%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 36-78 vs. 97%, 95% CI: 93-100]. Despite this higher vaccine coverage, seroprevalence of immunity was lower in the low incidence district compared with the high (71%, 95% CI: 63-80 vs. 83%, 95% CI: 76-90). Immunity in the high incidence district was associated with increased age, increased prevalence of toxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae carriers and with receipt of multiple (and likely more recent) boosters. CONCLUSIONS: Significant variation exists in vaccine coverage and seroprevalence of immunity to diphtheria in East Java. Immunity in high incidence districts is likely because of natural immunity acquired through exposure to toxigenic C. diphtheriae. Booster vaccines are essential for achieving protective levels of immunity.","Hughes GJ, Mikhail AF, Husada D, Irawan E, Kafatos G, Bracebridge S, Pebody R, Efstratiou A",Pediatr Infect Dis J,2015 Nov,Diphtheria AND Indonesia

A systematic literature review.","OBJECTIVES: In recent years, outbreaks and a rising incidence of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis have occurred in Asia, particularly in older children. METHODS: A systematic search of MEDLINE and Embase was conducted from January 2000 to October 2020 to identify the epidemiology of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and poliomyelitis in children and adolescents (aged 3-18 years) in Asia. The results were then related to vaccination schedules, booster coverage rates, pertussis source of infection, and booster immunogenicity, as identified by a pragmatic review. The International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) registration: #CRD42020222445. RESULTS: A total of 35 studies were included in this review. Limited data were reported on the epidemiology of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and poliomyelitis. Data from studies reporting the incidence of diphtheria and pertussis exemplify the shift in epidemiology to older children/adolescents. Seroprevalence data suggest that immunity to pertussis and diphtheria is below the level of herd immunity in several Asian countries in this population. CONCLUSION: The true burden of diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus in children aged 3-18 years in Asia is unknown because of weak or absent nationwide surveillance systems. The available evidence highlights the inadequacies in immunity, either by gaps in a recommendation or suboptimal booster coverage, supporting the public health need for booster vaccinations in this population.","Nicholson L, Adkins E, Karyanti MR, Ong-Lim A, Shenoy B, Huoi C, Vargas-Zambrano JC",Int J Infect Dis,2022 Apr,Diphtheria AND Indonesia
36721501,Genetic characterization of diphtheria tox B to evaluate vaccine efficacy in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Blocking the attachment of diphtheria toxins to host cells through the intact receptor binding site (tox B) was the initial mechanism of action of the diphtheria vaccine. Diphtheria outbreaks in populations with good vaccination coverage can be caused by mutations or changes in the genetic structure of the tox B protein. The aim of this study was to characterize the Tox B protein produced by Corynebacterium diphtheriae isolated from 2018 to 2019 in patients in Jakarta who had already received the diphtheria vaccine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of the 89 throat swab specimens of patients with a clinical diagnosis of diphtheria, 10 were positive for diphtheria and toxin. PCR was used to amplify the tox B DNA fragment in the 10 positive isolates. DNA sequencing was conducted with overlapping primers and the DNA sequences were analysed by using SeqScape V2.7. RESULTS: Of the 10 isolates, nine isolate showed a DNA mutation (G30A), but the mutation did not change the amino acid encoding arginin (silent mutation). Our findings indicate that the efficacy of the diphtheria vaccine used in Indonesia has not decreased because of mutations in the tox B genes not change the amino acid. CONCLUSION: Overall, there are no amino acid changes in the tox B protein, indicating that the outbreaks are not affected by mutation in tox B. Another possible mechanism - overexpression of the toxin - is likely responsible for causing diphtheria in patients who have a complete history of immunization in Indonesia.","Rosana Y, Lusiana DIG, Yasmon A",Iran J Microbiol,2022 Aug,Diphtheria AND Indonesia
37112714,Assessing Geographic Overlap between Zero-Dose Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis Vaccination Prevalence and Other Health Indicators.,"The integration of immunization with other essential health services is among the strategic priorities of the Immunization Agenda 2030 and has the potential to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of health service delivery. This study aims to evaluate the degree of spatial overlap between the prevalence of children who have never received a dose of the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-containing vaccine (no-DTP) and other health-related indicators, to provide insight into the potential for joint geographic targeting of integrated service delivery efforts. Using geospatially modeled estimates of vaccine coverage and comparator indicators, we develop a framework to delineate and compare areas of high overlap across indicators, both within and between countries, and based upon both counts and prevalence. We derive summary metrics of spatial overlap to facilitate comparison between countries and indicators and over time. As an example, we apply this suite of analyses to five countries-Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Indonesia, Ethiopia, and Angola-and five comparator indicators-children with stunting, under-5 mortality, children missing doses of oral rehydration therapy, prevalence of lymphatic filariasis, and insecticide-treated bed net coverage. Our results demonstrate substantial heterogeneity in the geographic overlap both within and between countries. These results provide a framework to assess the potential for joint geographic targeting of interventions, supporting efforts to ensure that all people, regardless of location, can benefit from vaccines and other essential health services.","Haeuser E, Nguyen JQ, Rolfe S, Nesbit O, Fullman N, Mosser JF",Vaccines (Basel),2023 Apr 5,Diphtheria AND Indonesia
32970569,Triage in the Time of Diphtheria.,"INTRODUCTION: A diphtheria outbreak occurred in 2017 in Jakarta, Indonesia, during which our hospital was appointed as a referral hospital where patients with upper respiratory tract symptoms were sent for confirmation of the diagnosis and medical intervention. In this study we review the implementation of the emergency department (ED) triage process and patient flow management during the diphtheria outbreak. No previous study in Indonesia has provided a detailed report on the triage process during infectious disease outbreaks. METHOD: We modified our pre-existing hospital triage method according to the ""identify, isolate, and inform"" principle. We developed novel criteria for triage to identify triage-suspected cases and also a diphtheria package to simplify the diagnostic process. Four separate rooms were modified to isolation spaces to enable medical staff to observe these patients. We obtained data from the ED outbreak registry and electronic health records. RESULTS: Of 60 cases of triage-suspected diphtheria, six were classified as suspected diphtheria. The mean time from ""identify"" to ""isolate"" was 3.5 minutes, and from ""isolate"" to ""inform"" was 10 minutes. Mean ED length of stay for probable diphtheria was 24.46 hours. No medical personnel in the ED showed any signs of diphtheria 30 days after the outbreak had abated. CONCLUSION: The modified criteria can help triage officers detect suspected diphtheria cases and measure the triage response time. Use of the diphtheria package and four separate rooms in the ED could act as an infection control procedure and facilitate the improvement of the diagnostic process.","Habib H, Kurniawaty H",West J Emerg Med,2020 Aug 21,Diphtheria AND Indonesia

39280325,Determinants of mortality in relationship between clinical and laboratory characteristics with the outcomes of children with diphtheria: A cross-sectional study at a national hospital of Sumatra region in 2020- 2023.,"In 2017, diphtheria outbreaks occurred in several provinces in Indonesia; however, the epidemiological data in the country is limited. The aim of this study was to determine the association between clinical findings and laboratory parameters associated with mortality of children with diphtheria. A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Haji Adam Malik General Hospital, Medan, Indonesia, covering diphtheria patients from January 2020 to December 2023. All patients aged 1-18 years clinically diagnosed with diphtheria were considered eligible. The associations between demographic characteristics, clinical features, immunization status, complications, and laboratory profiles with mortality were determined using Fisher's exact test, and the odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was calculated. Our data indicated that the clinical characteristics of myocarditis (p=0.005) and airway obstruction (p=0.003) were associated with mortality. There was also a significant association between thrombocytopenia (p=0.020) and mortality in diphtheria patients. Patients with airway obstruction were 13 times more likely to have an increase in mortality compared to patients without airway obstruction. This study highlights that clinical and laboratory characteristics could be associated with in-hospital mortality of diphtheria cases, and therefore, pediatricians should be aware of the presence of those characteristics to prevent the mortality of the patients.","Dinanti SP, Ramayani OR, Pasaribu AP",Narra J,2024 Aug,Diphtheria AND Indonesia
38312350,Assessing the impact of booster vaccination on diphtheria transmission: Mathematical modeling and risk zone mapping.,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruptions in the healthcare system, affecting vaccinations and the management of diphtheria cases. As a consequence of these disruptions, numerous countries have experienced a resurgence or an increase in diphtheria cases. West Java province in Indonesia is identified as one of the high-risk areas for diphtheria, experiencing an upward trend in cases from 2021 to 2023. To analyze the situation, we developed an SIR model, which integrated DPT and booster vaccinations to determine the basic reproduction number, an essential parameter for infectious diseases. Through spatial analysis of geo-referenced data, we identified hotspots and explained diffusion in diphtheria case clusters. The calculation of R(0) resulted in an R(0) = 1.17, indicating the potential for a diphtheria outbreak in West Java. To control the increasing cases, one possible approach is to raise the booster vaccination coverage from the current 64.84% to 75.15%, as suggested by simulation results. Furthermore, the spatial analysis revealed that hot spot clusters were present in the western, central, and southern regions, posing a high risk not only in densely populated areas but also in rural regions. The diffusion pattern of diphtheria clusters displayed an expansion-contagious pattern. Understanding the rising trend of diphtheria cases and their geographic distribution can offer crucial insights for government and health authorities to manage the number of diphtheria cases and make informed decisions regarding the best prevention and intervention strategies.","Fauzi IS, Nuraini N, Sari AM, Wardani IB, Taurustiati D, Simanullang PM, Lestari BW",Infect Dis Model,2024 Mar,Diphtheria AND Indonesia

10195774,Safety and immunogenicity of combined diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (whole cell and acellular)-Haemophilus influenzae-b conjugate vaccines administered to Indonesian children.,"A randomized double-blind trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of vaccines comprised of diphtheria (D) and tetanus (T) toxoids combined with either a whole cell (P) or an acellular (aP) pertussis component and Haemophilus influenzae type b polyribosylphosphate (PRP) tetanus toxoid conjugate (PRP-T) in Indonesian infants. Three doses of either DTaP, DTaP-PRP-T, or DTP-PRP-T were administered to 930 infants approximately 2-3 months of age and at 2 month intervals thereafter. A booster dose of either DTP-PRP-T or DTaP-PRP-T was administered at 15-18 months of age. Both local and systemic reactions occurred at a significantly (p < 0.001-0.026) higher rate in the group that received whole cell pertussis vaccine versus groups which were immunized with aP containing vaccines. There was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in the rate of adverse events between groups immunized with DTaP or DTaP PRP T. One month after the third dose of vaccine, 99% of subjects had achieved > or =0.1 IU of anti-D and anti-T antibody per ml of serum. The geometric mean titer (GMT) to D was significantly (p < 0.001) higher in the group immunized with DTaP versus the other two groups whereas the anti-T GMT was significantly (p < 0.006) higher for the group immunized with DTP-PRP-T. Both the anti-pertussis toxin (PT) and anti-filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) antibody levels were significantly (p < 0.001) higher in recipients of acellular versus whole cell pertussis vaccine. In contrast, the anti-B. pertussis agglutinating antibody response was significantly (p < 0.0001) higher in the group immunized with whole cell pertussis vaccine. The anti-PRP GMTs (microg antibody/ml) at 7 months were 0.096, 3.35 and 6.11 for groups immunized with DTaP, DTaP-PRP-T and DTP-PRP-T, respectively. The GMT for those immunized with DTP-PRP-T was significantly (p < 0.001) higher compared to recipients of DTaP-PRP-T. The percent of children who attained > or =0.15 or > or =1 microg/ml after immunization was 18 and 2% for the DTaP group, 93 and 76% for the DTaP-PRP-T group and 97 and 88% for the DTP-PRP-T group. At the > or =1 microg/ml level the difference between the DTaP-PRP0-T and DTP-PRP-T groups was significant (p < 0.01). Children immunized with either DTaP, DTaP-PRP-T, or DTP-PRP-T were reimmunized with DTaP-PRP-T whereas a portion of children immunized with DTP PRP T where also boosted with this vaccine at 15-18 months of age. There was a vigorous anamnestic response to the D and T components with all children possessing > or =0.1 IU/ml. There was also a substantial increase in anti-PT, anti-FHA and B. pertussis agglutinating antibodies. The poorest anti-PT response was seen among children receiving DTP-PRP-T for both primary and reimmunization while the highest agglutinating antibody response followed receipt of 4 doses of DTP-PRP-T. Greater than 80% of children immunized with either DTP PRP T or DTaP-PRP-T possessed > or =0.15 microg/ml before boosting versus 38% for those vaccinated with DTaP (p < 0.001). Primary immunization with DTP-PRP-T resulted in a significantly (p < 0.05) higher percentage (72%) maintaining > or =1 microg/ml compared to those immunized with DTaP-PRP-T (46%). Prior to reimmunization, the anti-PRP GMT was significantly (p < 0.005) higher for children immunized with 3 doses of DTP-PRP-T versus DTaP-PRP-T. Subsequent to reimmunization, > or =95% of subjects attained > or =1 microg/ml.","Richie E, Punjabi NH, Harjanto SJ, Wangsasaputral F, Sukandar M, Supriatman M, Simanjuntak CH, Que JU, Cryz SJ Jr",Vaccine,1999 Mar 17,Diphtheria AND Indonesia
39340062,The Improvement of Adaptive Immune Responses towards COVID-19 Following Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis and SARS-CoV-2 Vaccinations in Indonesian Children: Exploring the Roles of Heterologous Immunity.,"BACKGROUND: Routine childhood vaccination, e.g., for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP), might provide additional protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. This concept of heterologous immunity was explored in healthy children receiving both DTP and inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed on 154 healthy children aged 6-8 years old in Jakarta, Indonesia. Their vaccination status for the DTP (including a diphtheria-tetanus booster vaccine at 5 years old) and CoronaVac (from 6 years old) vaccines were recorded. Peripheral blood samples were collected from all participants, in which anti-diphtheria toxoid IgG and anti-SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD antibodies and T cell-derived IFN-gamma were measured. RESULTS: The study participants with complete DTP vaccination had significantly higher titers of anti-diphtheria toxoid IgG than the ones without (median = 0.9349 versus 0.2113 IU/mL; p < 0.0001). Upon stratification based on DTP and CoronaVac vaccination statuses, the participants with complete DTP and CoronaVac vaccinations had the highest titer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD antibodies (median = 1196 U/mL) and the highest concentration of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell-derived IFN-gamma (median = 560.9 mIU/mL) among all the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Healthy children aged 6-8 years old with complete DTP and CoronaVac vaccinations exhibited stronger SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immune responses. This might suggest an additional benefit of routine childhood vaccination in generating protection against novel pathogens, presumably via heterologous immunity.","Santi T, Jo J, Harahap AR, Werdhani RA, Hadinegoro SRS, SahBandar IN, Prayitno A, Munasir Z, Vandenplas Y, Hegar B",Vaccines (Basel),2024 Sep 9,Diphtheria AND Indonesia
39330893,"Eleven-Year Report of High Number of Diphtheria Cases in Children in East Java Province, Indonesia.","A high incidence of diphtheria cases in children in East Java province, Indonesia, has been observed since the beginning of this century. Despite many efforts, the outbreaks continue. This study aims to explain the high incidence of diphtheria in children in East Java province since 2013. This cross-sectional surveillance report-based study used data from 38 districts in East Java since 1 January 2013. Collected data included demographics, clinical information, additional examinations, immunization history, and close contact management. Over eleven years, there were 4009 diphtheria patients, of whom 2921 (72.86%) were under 18 years of age. Boys (59.77%) outnumbered girls, and the most common age category was >60-144 months (51.66%). Most cases had incomplete or zero immunization (76.16%). Tonsillopharyngeal diphtheria was the most common type (69.60%). The five top districts with the most cases were Surabaya, Sidoarjo, Kabupaten Blitar, Kota Malang, and Kabupaten Malang. The eleven-year case fatality rate (CFR) was 2.36% (69/2921). This study shows that diphtheria cases in children and adolescents in East Java have consistently been high, and low immunization coverage might still be the leading cause. There has also been a shift in the district distribution. Diphtheria outbreaks require complete and sustainable efforts, not just outbreak response immunizations.","Husada D, Hartini Y, Nuringhati KW, Tindage SG, Mustikasari RI, Kartina L, Puspitasari D, Basuki PS, Moedjito I, Zumaroh Z, Susanto H, Wulandari W, Anggraini SD, Triyono EA",Trop Med Infect Dis,2024 Sep 7,Diphtheria AND Indonesia
31723410,"Risk factors for diphtheria outbreak in children aged 1-10 years in East Kalimantan Province, Indonesia.","Background: Diphtheria remains a health problem, especially in developing countries. In November 2017, the Indonesian Ministry of Health stated that there was a diphtheria outbreak in Indonesia. East Kalimantan is one of the provinces that experienced this disease outbreak. This study analyzes the risk factors for diphtheria outbreak in children aged 1-10 years. Methods: A case-control study was conducted on 37 respondents. Research variables consist of immunization status against diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT), nutritional status, children mobility, source of transmission, physical home environment (natural lighting, ventilation area, occupancy density, wall and floor type), knowledge of diphtheria and attitudes towards the diphtheria prevention program. Results: We found that the most of the children who had diphtheria had been immunized against DPT. Additionally the nutritional status of children (p=0.049), mobility (p=0.000) and the source of transmission (p=0.020) were significantly associated with diphtheria. Conclusions: Child/parent mobility (OR=8.456) is the main risk factor for diphtheria outbreak. It is recommended to limit the mobility of children to travel to areas that are experiencing increased cases of diphtheria, improve the nutritional status, and further research on the effectiveness of diphtheria vaccine.","Muhamad Ramdan I, Susanti R, Ifroh RH, Noviasty R",F1000Res,2018,Diphtheria AND Indonesia

The last effort to stop the outbreak in the province was a three round outbreak response immunization (ORI) in 2018.The aim of the this study was to evaluate the impact of the 2018 ORI in East Java province - 6 months following the completion of the program. Surveillance data was collected for 6 month period, from January to June 2019. The source of data was the district health offices, hospitals, community health centers, and private physician and paramedic practices. The data included demographic characteristics, involved health facilities, patient immunization history, clinical signs and symptoms, some laboratory test results and other additional examinations. All cases were evaluated by the East Java Provincial Diphtheria Expert Committee and not based on the individual physician decision. During the 6 month period, there were 97 diphtheria cases which approved by the Diphtheria Expert Committee. The reports came from 36 of 38 districts. One patient died, denoting a case fatality rate of 1%. The majority were 19 years of age or less, with uncomplete immunization. Patients above 19 years were 24%. Compared with 2017 (438 cases) and 2018 (310), 2019 saw a significant reduction in the number of reported cases. Only 4 positive culture results were collected (positivity rate 4,13%).

27497954,State of inequality in diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis immunisation coverage in low-income and middle-income countries: a multicountry study of household health surveys.,"BACKGROUND: Immunisation programmes have made substantial contributions to lowering the burden of disease in children, but there is a growing need to ensure that programmes are equity-oriented. We aimed to provide a detailed update about the state of between-country inequality and within-country economic-related inequality in the delivery of three doses of the combined diphtheria, tetanus toxoid, and pertussis-containing vaccine (DTP3), with a special focus on inequalities in high-priority countries. METHODS: We used data from the latest available Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys done in 51 low-income and middle-income countries. Data for DTP3 coverage were disaggregated by wealth quintile, and inequality was calculated as difference and ratio measures based on coverage in richest (quintile 5) and poorest (quintile 1) household wealth quintiles. Excess change was calculated for 21 countries with data available at two timepoints spanning a 10 year period. Further analyses were done for six high-priority countries-ie, those with low national immunisation coverage and/or high absolute numbers of unvaccinated children. Significance was determined using 95% CIs. FINDINGS: National DTP3 immunisation coverage across the 51 study countries ranged from 32% in Central African Republic to 98% in Jordan. Within countries, the gap in DTP3 immunisation coverage suggested pro-rich inequality, with a difference of 20 percentage points or more between quintiles 1 and 5 for 20 of 51 countries. In Nigeria, Pakistan, Laos, Cameroon, and Central African Republic, the difference between quintiles 1 and 5 exceeded 40 percentage points. In 15 of 21 study countries, an increase over time in national coverage of DTP3 immunisation was realised alongside faster improvements in the poorest quintile than the richest. For example, in Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Gabon, Mali, and Nepal, the absolute increase in coverage was at least 2.0 percentage points per year, with faster improvement in the poorest quintile. Substantial economic-related inequality in DTP3 immunisation coverage was reported in five high-priority study countries (DR Congo, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Pakistan), but not Uganda. INTERPRETATION: Overall, within-country inequalities in DTP3 immunisation persist, but seem to have narrowed over the past 10 years. Monitoring economic-related inequalities in immunisation coverage is warranted to reveal where gaps exist and inform appropriate approaches to reach disadvantaged populations.

39357185,"Immunogenicity of monoclonal antibody: Causes, consequences, and control strategies.","Antibody-based treatment was first used in 1891 for the treatment of diphtheria. Since then, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been developed to treat many diseases such as cancer and act as vaccines. However, murine-derived therapeutic mAbs were found to be highly immunogenic, and caused anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) reaction, reducing their efficacy and causing severe infusion reactions. Fully human, humanised, and chimeric antibodies were then introduced for better therapeutic efficacy. With the introduction of immune response associated with mAbs immunogenicity. This review explores the immunogenicity of mAbs, its mechanism, contributing factors, and its impact on therapeutic efficacy. It also discusses immunogenicity assessment for preclinical studies and strategies for minimising immunogenicity for effective therapeutic treatment in various diseases. Finally, predicting immunogenicity in drug development is essential for selecting top drug candidates. A lot of methods can be implemented by the researchers and developers to reduce the development of ADAs while simultaneously minimising the immunogenicity reaction of mAbs.","Asmani AZA, Zainuddin AFF, Azmi Murad NA, Mohd Darwis NH, Suhaimi NS, Zaini E, Taher M, Susanti D, Khotib J",Pathol Res Pract,2024 Nov,Diphtheria AND Indonesia

38857311,"Immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and IgE-mediated immune responses of a mixed whole-cell and acellular pertussis vaccine schedule in Australian infants: A randomised, double-blind, noninferiority trial.","BACKGROUND: In many countries, infant vaccination with acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines has replaced use of more reactogenic whole-cell pertussis (wP) vaccines. Based on immunological and epidemiological evidence, we hypothesised that substituting the first aP dose in the routine vaccination schedule with wP vaccine might protect against IgE-mediated food allergy. We aimed to compare reactogenicity, immunogenicity, and IgE-mediated responses of a mixed wP/aP primary schedule versus the standard aP-only schedule. METHODS AND FINDINGS: OPTIMUM is a Bayesian, 2-stage, double-blind, randomised trial. In stage one, infants were assigned (1:1) to either a first dose of a pentavalent wP combination vaccine (DTwP-Hib-HepB, Pentabio PT Bio Farma, Indonesia) or a hexavalent aP vaccine (DTaP-Hib-HepB-IPV, Infanrix hexa, GlaxoSmithKline, Australia) at approximately 6 weeks old. Subsequently, all infants received the hexavalent aP vaccine at 4 and 6 months old as well as an aP vaccine at 18 months old (DTaP-IPV, Infanrix-IPV, GlaxoSmithKline, Australia). Stage two is ongoing and follows the above randomisation strategy and vaccination schedule. Ahead of ascertainment of the primary clinical outcome of allergist-confirmed IgE-mediated food allergy by 12 months old, here we present the results of secondary immunogenicity, reactogenicity, tetanus toxoid IgE-mediated immune responses, and parental acceptability endpoints. Serum IgG responses to diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis antigens were measured using a multiplex fluorescent bead-based immunoassay; total and specific IgE were measured in plasma by means of the ImmunoCAP assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The immunogenicity of the mixed schedule was defined as being noninferior to that of the aP-only schedule using a noninferiority margin of 2/3 on the ratio of the geometric mean concentrations (GMR) of pertussis toxin (PT)-IgG 1 month after the 6-month aP. Solicited adverse reactions were summarised by study arm and included all children who received the first dose of either wP or aP. Parental acceptance was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale. The primary analyses were based on intention-to-treat (ITT); secondary per-protocol (PP) analyses were also performed. The trial is registered with ANZCTR (ACTRN12617000065392p). Between March 7, 2018 and January 13, 2020, 150 infants were randomised (75 per arm). PT-IgG responses of the mixed schedule were noninferior to the aP-only schedule at approximately 1 month after the 6-month aP dose [GMR = 0.98, 95% credible interval (0.77 to 1.26); probability (GMR > 2/3) > 0.99; ITT analysis]. At 7 months old, the posterior median probability of quantitation for tetanus toxoid IgE was 0.22 (95% credible interval 0.12 to 0.34) in both the mixed schedule group and in the aP-only group. Despite exclusions, the results were consistent in the PP analysis. At 6 weeks old, irritability was the most common systemic solicited reaction reported in wP (65 [88%] of 74) versus aP (59 [82%] of 72) vaccinees. At the same age, severe systemic reactions were reported among 14 (19%) of 74 infants after wP and 8 (11%) of 72 infants after aP. There were 7 SAEs among 5 participants within the first 6 months of follow-up; on blinded assessment, none were deemed to be related to the study vaccines. Parental acceptance of mixed and aP-only schedules was high (71 [97%] of 73 versus 69 [96%] of 72 would agree to have the same schedule again). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the aP-only schedule, the mixed schedule evoked noninferior PT-IgG responses, was associated with more severe reactions, but was well accepted by parents. Tetanus toxoid IgE responses did not differ across the study groups.

38250846,Access to DTP-Based Combination Vaccines in Asia-Pacific Countries between 2019 and 2022.,"The Asia-Pacific countries are highly diverse in health and economic conditions that may impact vaccine access and uptake. Our study aimed to characterize patterns of health access to DTP-based combination vaccines in 10 countries from 2019 to 2022 using the IQVIA-MIDAS database. The availability, affordability, and accessibility were compared across countries by national health and economic performance indicators using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Our findings showed that the three aspects of access to DTP-based vaccines varied substantially in the Asia-Pacific region, with higher levels in countries with better health and economic performance. Affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine accessibility fluctuates significantly in lower-income countries, with DTP coverage rates falling by more than 14% in the Philippines and Indonesia between 2019 and 2021. For availability and affordability, Singapore and Malaysia from high-income groups were largely affected, which may be related to health expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product (Coefficient = 0.39, p = 0.03). Our study indicates that greater attention needs to be paid to national health expenditure and routine immunization services to improve vaccine disparities and increase the robustness and resilience of the vaccine supply chain during public health emergencies.","Ma J, Sun Y, Cui Y, Dong J, Huang Y",Vaccines (Basel),2023 Dec 28,Diphtheria AND Indonesia
35033034,"Seroprevalence of IgG antibodies against diphtheria antitoxin among migrant workers in Singapore, 2016-2019.","BACKGROUND: Since the last local case of diphtheria in 1992, there had not been any case in Singapore until an autochthonous case was reported in 2017. This fatal diphtheria case of a migrant worker raised concerns about the potential re-emergence of locally transmitted toxigenic diphtheria in Singapore. We conducted a seroprevalence study to assess the immunity levels to diphtheria among migrant workers in Singapore. METHODS: Residual sera from migrant workers who hailed from Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar and the Philippines were tested for anti-diphtheria toxoid immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. These migrant workers previously participated in a survey between 2016 and 2019 and had provided blood samples as part of the survey procedure. RESULTS: A total of 2176 migrant workers were included in the study. Their overall mean age was 27.1 years (standard deviation 5.0), range was 20-43 years. The proportion having at least basic protection against diphtheria (antitoxin titres >/= 0.01 IU/ml) ranged from 77.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 72.8 - 82.3%) among migrant workers from Bangladesh to 96.7% (95% CI 92.5 - 98.6%) in those hailing from Malaysia. The proportion showing full protection (antitoxin titres >/= 0.10 IU/ml) ranged from 10.1% (95% CI 6.5 - 15.4%) in Chinese workers to 23.0% (95% CI 17.1 - 30.3%) in Malaysian workers. There were no significant differences in the proportion with at least basic protection across birth cohorts, except for those from Bangladesh where the seroprevalence was significantly lower in younger migrant workers born after 1989. CONCLUSIONS: The proportions having at least basic protection against diphtheria in migrant workers from five out of seven Asian countries (India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar and the Philippines) were higher than 85%, the threshold for diphtheria herd immunity. Seroprevalence surveys should be conducted periodically to assess the level of immunity against diphtheria and other vaccine preventable diseases in migrant worker population, so that appropriate interventions such as booster vaccination can be implemented proactively to prevent sporadic outbreaks.","Ang LW, Gao Q, Cui L, Farwin A, Toh MPHS, Boudville IC, Chen MI, Chow A, Lin RT, Lee VJM, Leo YS",BMC Public Health,2022 Jan 16,Diphtheria AND Indonesia
40365148,"Incidence of Myocarditis Associated with Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis Vaccine: A Rare Case Series.","Myocarditis induced by diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccination is extremely rare, accounting for only two cases thus far. Hence, to supplement knowledge regarding its pathogenesis and treatment, we reported two cases of myocarditis associated with DTP vaccination in adults. Two patients (a 40-year-old female and a 43-year-old male) presented with mild symptoms and were hemodynamically stable. In both patients, the DTP vaccination was given 4 and 6 days before admission. Both patients had prolonged corrected QT interval (QTc), poor left ventricular function, and high troponin levels at admission. However, numerous ST segment depression was only noted in the first case. Bacteriology and virology study results were negative for any pathogen. No atherosclerotic lesions were observed by coronary angiography. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was only performed in the second case, which confirmed the diagnosis of myocarditis. Initial therapy was administered with a beta-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and intravenous methylprednisolone. Nonetheless, in the first case, rapid clinical deterioration and sudden cardiac death occur within 3 days of hospitalization. Learn from the first case, a high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment was initiated in the second case, which resulted in an improvement in left ventricular function and clinical symptoms, as well as a significant reduction in QTc interval and troponin levels. Rapid diagnostic testing and early recognition of the fulminant course is mandatory, allowing clinicians to aggressively treat the patient with high-dose intravenous immune globulin, thus obtaining a better outcome.","Iqbal M, Febrianora M, Putra ICS, Pramudyo M, Achmad C",Int J Angiol,2025 Jun,Diphtheria AND Indonesia

A previous study has shown that intracellularly expressing CRM197EK in Escherichia coli (E. coli) host formed inclusion bodies that need a complicated purification and refolding step. Protein purification from inclusion bodies can be overcome by solubilization of inclusion bodies by using N-lauroyl sarcosine (sarkosyl). In this work, recombinant CRM197EK (rCRM197EK) was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) as inclusion bodies, then solubilized using sarkosyl to form a soluble rCRM197EK without the need for a renaturation process. Furthermore, rCRM197EK was purified using the Ni-NTA column, characterized by SDS-PAGE and Western Blot, and its biological activity was assayed through its DNase activity. Moreover, its binding affinity with anti-diphtheria toxin (DT) antibody was measured using the surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The result showed that solubilization with sarkosyl form soluble rCRM197EK (61.61 kDa) was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western Blot with a yield of 2.8 mg/mL. rCRM197EK shows DNase activity, and the SPR assay shows that it can interact with an anti-DT antibody with a binding energy of - 9.2 kcal/mol.","Novianti MT, Subroto T, Efendi YS, Baroroh U, Kusumawardani S, Gumilar G, Yusuf M, Gaffar S",Mol Biotechnol,2024 Aug 6,Diphtheria AND Indonesia
33613904,Detection of toxin-producing Corynebacterium diphtheriae from throat swabs of diphtheria patients using duplex real-time PCR.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Diphtheria is a potentially fatal disease caused by toxigenic bacterial infection, particularly from Corynebacterium diphtheriae (C. diphtheriae). Isolation of C. diphtheriae is technically lacking in sensitivity, and Elek's test to detect toxin production has several difficulties associated with its application. Duplex real-time PCR to throat swab of suspected diphtheria patients can detect both bacteria and toxin-encoding genes simultaneously, faster, with higher sensitivity and specificity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 89 consecutive throat swabs from suspected diphtheria patients were collected from Sulianti Saroso Infectious Disease Hospital, Jakarta, during 2018 to 2019. Two pairs of primers and probes, targeting the rpoB gene of C. diphtheriae and the A-subunit of the diphtheria toxin gene, were used in this study. Parameters including annealing temperature, concentration of primers and probes, inhibitors, cross-reaction and detection limit were all optimized. Elek's toxigenicity test and clinical data were analyzed for comparison. RESULTS: The optimum annealing temperature was 55 degrees C. The concentrations of Cd primer, Tox primer, Cd probe and Tox probe were 0.4, 0.6, 0.5 and 0.625 microM, respectively. DNA elution and template volumes were 50 microL and 5 microL. The detection limit was 2 CFU/mL. No cross-reaction with other microorganisms was observed. Of the 89 samples, duplex real-time PCR gave better results than the standard test, with 19 (21.3%) and 10 (11.2%) patients diagnosed with diphtheria, respectively. CONCLUSION: Duplex real-time PCR increases the rate of laboratory diagnosis of diphtheria, compared to the standard method to detect potentially toxigenic C. diphtheriae.","Rosana Y, Prilandari LI, Ajisman R, Hartono TS, Yasmon A",Iran J Microbiol,2020 Dec,Diphtheria AND Indonesia
31522808,Exploring parents' reasons for incomplete childhood immunisation in Indonesia.,"INTRODUCTION: Immunisation is one of the most successful interventions for controlling infectious diseases but relies on continuous high coverage. Parental vaccine refusal and logistical barriers to access are threats to the success of immunisation programs, with resultant population immunity gaps leading to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. In Indonesia, coverage of childhood vaccines is suboptimal, with poor coverage of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine leading to a large diphtheria outbreak in 2017. METHODS: To explore the underlying parents' reasons for incomplete childhood immunisation in Indonesia, semi-structured interviews were conducted in Tangerang Selatan, Banten Province, Indonesia. Sixteen purposively selected primary carers of partially and unimmunised children were interviewed. Transcripts were coded and analysed using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Parental reasons were categorised into three interrelated themes of belief barriers, safety concerns, and issues of trust and misinformation. Stark differences were evident in reasons provided by carers of unimmunised children compared to partially immunised children. For parents of unimmunised children, Islamic beliefs, belief in the strength of natural immunity, and the use of alternative medicines strongly influenced behaviours. Safety concerns, issues of trust including distrust in the government, misinformation, and trust in information obtained through social networks were also prominent. In contrast, concerns about mild side-effects and logistical barriers outweighed beliefs among carers of partially immunised children. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the complexities in decision making for parents who decide not to vaccinate their children. In the Indonesian context, public health education and engagement of religious leaders to bridge the gap between religious beliefs and vaccine acceptance are needed to address vaccine refusal. Future research on the influence of social networks on vaccine hesitancy in the Indonesian context is also warranted. For parents of partially vaccinated children, interventions should focus on barriers of access to community health staff to encourage timely schedule completion.","Syiroj ATR, Pardosi JF, Heywood AE",Vaccine,2019 Oct 8,Diphtheria AND Indonesia
31829153,First-line antibiotic susceptibility pattern of toxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Diphtheria has been reported as an outbreak in some regions in Indonesia, most especially in East Java Province. Resistance to penicillin, erythromycin, and other antibiotics, single or multiple, has been reported in several studies. This study aims to evaluate the first-line antibiotic susceptibility pattern of toxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae isolates. METHODS: This descriptive observational study was performed from August to November 2018. C. diphtheriae isolates were collected from diphtheria patients and carriers in East Java from 2012 to 2017 and kept at the Balai Besar Laboratorium Kesehatan Daerah Surabaya or the Public Health Laboratory of Surabaya. Sample selection was done by random cluster sampling. The sensitivity test by E-test(R)of the five antibiotics (penicillin, oxacillin, erythromycin, azithromycin, and clarithromycin) was done to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute M45A (2015) Corynebacterium spp. for penicillin and erythromycin was used as standard. RESULTS: From 114 targeted isolates, 108 were viable and toxigenic. The E-test was performed on the viable isolates. The majority of the hosts were male (58.3%), with median (range) age of 6.5 (1-14) years. Half of the samples were from the 1 to 5-year-old age group. The isolates were acquired much more from patients (78.7%) than carriers (21.3%) and from pharyngeal swab (74.1%). Most of these isolates were from Madura Island (47.2%) and the northern and eastern parts of the province (horseshoe area). Mitis isolates were the major variant (76.9%). The susceptibility pattern of C. diphtheriae to erythromycin was better than that to penicillin. The E-test result for penicillin was 68.52% susceptible, 31.48% intermediate, and 0% resistant (MIC range, < 0.016 to 2 mug/L) and for erythromycin (MIC range, < 0.016 to > 256 mug/L) was 85.2% susceptible, 12% intermediate, and 2.8% resistant The MIC range for oxacillin was 1 to 96 mug/L, while for both azithromycin and clarithromycin were <  0.016 to > 256 mug/L. CONCLUSION: The susceptibility rate of C. diphtheriae to erythromycin is higher than that to penicillin. The regular update of antibiotic selection to the national guidelines is recommended. The MIC reference standard to azithromycin and clarithromycin is also needed.","Husada D, Soegianto SDP, Kurniawati IS, Hendrata AP, Irawan E, Kartina L, Puspitasari D, Basuki PS, Ismoedijanto",BMC Infect Dis,2019 Dec 11,Diphtheria AND Indonesia
34704079,Medical students' positive perception towards vaccination is strongly correlated to protective diphtheria antibody after Td vaccination.,"Negative perception towards vaccination is one of the reasons for low coverage of diphtheria immunization in Indonesia. Perception, which is difficult to change, is related to stress level, possibly influences outcome of diseases, and also vaccination. This study aims to identify the correlation between perception of diphtheria vaccination and antibody response after vaccination. This study used secondary data from two unpublished studies on 30 medical interns in Hasan Sadikin Hospital, Bandung, West Java, after diphtheria outbreak, from June to July 2019. Antibody level after diphtheria emergency vaccination was measured using ELISA and perception towards vaccination was measured using a questionnaire. Perception towards vaccination was expressed as perception score and was divided into 4 components: perceived threat, benefit, barrier, and cues to action. Higher perception score indicated more positive perception towards vaccination. Diphtheria antibody level was grouped into reliable protection (>/=0,10 IU/mL) or unreliable protection (<0,10 IU/mL). Statistical correlation analysis was done with GraphPad Prism version 7.0. Most of our subjects were female. Median age was 22 (20-24) years old. Median time elapsed between vaccination date and measurement of antibody level was 18 (6-18) months. Median antibody level was 0,28 (0,09-3,47) IU/mL. Twenty-three subjects (82,1%) had reliable protection. Subjects with reliable protection had more positive perception compared to unreliable protection (perception score 80,6 ​+/- ​5,4 vs 69,0 ​+/- ​1,8, p ​= ​0,0001). Subjects with reliable protection had less perceived barrier for vaccination (15,6 ​+/- ​2,1 vs 13,0 ​+/- ​1,8, p ​= ​0,0083). Perception score showed strong, positive correlation to reliable protection against diphtheria (R ​= ​0,705, p ​< ​0,001). Perceived barrier and threat showed positive correlation to reliable protection (R ​= ​0,489, p ​= ​0,008 and R ​= ​0,402, p ​= ​0,034). In conclusion, perception towards diphtheria vaccination is strongly correlated to protective antibody. Improving perception of vaccination are needed to overcome vaccine hesitancy.","Pranggono EH, Tiara MR, Pamungkas TC, Syafriati E, Mutyara K, Wisaksana R",Brain Behav Immun Health,2021 Dec,Diphtheria AND Indonesia
27840012,"Evaluation of a multinational, multilingual vaccine debate on Twitter.","BACKGROUND: Public confidence in an immunization programme is a pivotal determinant of the programme's success. The mining of social media is increasingly employed to provide insight into the public's sentiment. This research further explores the value of monitoring social media to understand public sentiment about an international vaccination programme. OBJECTIVE: To gain insight into international public discussion on the paediatric pentavalent vaccine (DTP-HepB-Hib) programme by analysing Twitter messages. METHODS: Using a multilingual search, we retrospectively collected all public Twitter messages mentioning the DTP-HepB-Hib vaccine from July 2006 until May 2015. We analysed message characteristics by frequency of referencing other websites, type of websites, and geographic focus of the discussion. In addition, a sample of messages was manually annotated for positive or negative message tone. RESULTS: We retrieved 5771 messages. Only 3.1% of the messages were reactions to other messages, and 86.6% referred to websites, mostly news sites (70.7%), other social media (9.8%), and health-information sites (9.5%). Country mentions were identified in 70.4% of the messages, of which India (35.4%), Indonesia (18.3%), and Vietnam (13.9%) were the most prevalent. In the annotated sample, 63% of the messages showed a positive or neutral sentiment about DTP-HepB-Hib. Peaks in negative and positive messages could be related to country-specific programme events. CONCLUSIONS: Public messages about DTP-HepB-Hib were characterized by little interaction between tweeters, and by frequent referencing of websites and other information links. Twitter messages can indirectly reflect the public's opinion about major events in the debates about the DTP-HepB-Hib vaccine.","Becker BF, Larson HJ, Bonhoeffer J, van Mulligen EM, Kors JA, Sturkenboom MC",Vaccine,2016 Dec 7,Diphtheria AND Indonesia
38024006,The Role of Dexmedetomidine in Airway Management for Tracheostomy in Pediatric Patient with Obstructed Airway Due to Diphtheria: A Case Report.,"INTRODUCTION: Diphtheria is an infectious disease caused by exotoxin-producing Corynebacterium diphteriae and was a leading cause of death in childhood during the prevaccine era. This toxin is usually localized in the upper respiratory tract and may cause fatal airway obstruction. Many have used orotracheal intubation to secure the airway in diphtheria cases. However, the efficacy of tracheostomy under sedation while maintaining spontaneous ventilation and analgesia using trans-tracheal and superficial cervical block remains to be elucidated. CASE PRESENTATION: A 6-year-old presented to the emergency room with respiratory distress and was diagnosed with diphtheria. A thick membrane in the oropharyngeal area and chest X-ray showed infiltrations indicative of pneumonia. The patient successfully underwent emergency tracheostomy under sedation using a combination of sevoflurane and dexmedetomidine to achieve prompt sedation and trans-tracheal injection and bilateral superficial cervical block as analgesia for the intra-tracheal and the incision. The patient's condition deteriorated the next day, and the bronchoscopy showed that the carina and main bronchus were covered by a pseudomembrane, obstructing the airway below the tracheostomy. The patient eventually died two days after admission. CONCLUSIONS: Dexmedetomidine has minimal impact on ventilatory function and anti-sialagogue properties, while sevoflurane has minimal effect on respiratory depression. This case presentation showed that a combination of sevoflurane and dexmedetomidine with spontaneous assisted ventilation could be helpful in tracheostomy procedures in pediatric patients with airway obstruction due to diphtheria, along with the use of trans-tracheal and superficial cervical block as the analgesia. This report also indicates that being vigilant in rapidly-progressing and fatal pediatric diphtheria cases is vital.","Omega A, Ramadian F, Hakim PNK",Anesth Pain Med,2023 Aug,Diphtheria AND Indonesia
31564451,Home-based records and vaccination appointment stickers as parental reminders to reduce vaccination dropout in Indonesia: A cluster-randomized controlled trial.,"INTRODUCTION: Limited evidence is available about the effectiveness of strategies to remind caregivers when to bring children back for future vaccinations in low- and middle-income country settings. We evaluated the effectiveness of two reminder strategies based on home-based vaccination records (HBR) in Indonesia. METHODS: In this cluster-randomized controlled trial involving 3616 children <1 year of age, 90 health facilities were randomly assigned to either a control group or one of two intervention groups: (1) HBR-only group, where healthcare workers provided an HBR to any child without an HBR during a vaccination visit and instructed the caregiver to keep it at home between visits, or (2) HBR + sticker group, where, in addition to HBR provision, healthcare workers placed vaccination appointment reminder stickers on the HBR. The primary outcome was receipt of the third dose of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-containing vaccine (DTPcv3) within 7 months and the secondary outcome was receipt of a timely DTPcv3 dose. RESULTS: Control group DTPcv3 coverage was 81%. In intention-to-treat analysis, neither intervention group had significantly different DTPcv3 coverage compared with the control group (RR = 0.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87; 1.02 for HBR-only group; RR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.90; 1.04 for HBR + sticker group) by study end. However, children in the HBR + sticker group were 50% more likely to have received a DTPcv3 vaccination (RR = 1.46, 95% CI 1.02, 2.09) within 60 days of DTPcv1 vaccination, compared with children in the control group; children in the HBR-only group were not more likely to have done so (RR = 1.05, 95% CI 0.71, 1.55). DISCUSSION: Reminder stickers had an immediate effect on coverage by improving the proportion of children who received a timely DTPcv3 dose but no effect on the proportion who received DTPcv3 after 7 months. Coupling reminder stickers with strategies to address other reasons why children do not return for vaccination visits should be further explored.","Wallace AS, Peetosutan K, Untung A, Ricardo M, Yosephine P, Wannemuehler K, Brown DW, McFarland DA, Orenstein WA, Rosenberg ES, Omer SB, Daniels D",Vaccine,2019 Oct 23,Diphtheria AND Indonesia
16303216,"Immunogenicity and safety of four different doses of Haemophilus influenzae type b-tetanus toxoid conjugated vaccine, combined with diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine (DTP-Hib), in Indonesian infants.","Widespread use of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugated vaccine in industrialized countries has resulted in a dramatic decline in the incidence of invasive Hib diseases, but the vaccine's cost has prevented its inclusion in basic immunization programs in developing countries. To overcome this problem, combination with diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine or reduction in the dose of Hib vaccine has been proposed. To evaluate the immunogenicity and adverse reactions from lower doses of Hib-polyribosylphosphate (PRP) conjugated with tetanus toxoid (PRP-T), a double-blind study was conducted in Jakarta, Indonesia, and its suburbs. A total of 1048 infants 6 weeks to 6 months of age received three doses of DTP vaccine combined with the usual 10 microg dose or with a reduced dose of 5, 2.5 or 1.25 microg of PRP-T at two-monthly intervals. Antibodies were measured prior to the first dose and 4-6 weeks following the third dose. Adverse reactions were similar among all four groups. The only significant difference was a higher rate of irritability (p<0.02) and of temperature elevation >38 degrees C (p<0.009) after doses 1 and 2 in the lowest dose group (1.25 microg PRP-T) compared to the other groups. All participants tested had a 4-fold increase in antibodies against all DTP antigens. In addition, after a fourth booster dose of Hib, 99.6% of infants produced >or=0.15 microg/ml of antibody to Hib-PRP, and 96.4% showed levels >or=1.0 microg/ml after primary immunization, level that correlate with short- and long-term immunity, respectively. Antibody titers to the PRP antigen showed no significant differences among dosage groups with the exception of the 5.0 microg group, which had a significantly higher GMC than the 1.25 microg group (p<0.012). This study demonstrates that primary vaccination with half, one-fourth, or one-eighth of the usual dose of PRP-T, combined with DTP vaccine, produces protective immune responses, and has side effects that are comparable to DTP vaccination alone. In these lower dosages, PRP-T conjugate vaccine can lower vaccine costs to a level that is affordable for infant immunization programs in developing countries.","Punjabi NH, Richie EL, Simanjuntak CH, Harjanto SJ, Wangsasaputra F, Arjoso S, Rofiq A, Prijanto M, Julitasari, Yela U, Herzog C, Cryz SJ",Vaccine,2006 Mar 10,Diphtheria AND Indonesia
34214325,Secondary metabolite and antipyretic effects of Maja (Crescentia cujete L.) in fever-induced mice.,"OBJECTIVES: Fever is a condition when the body experiences an increase in average body temperature above normal level. Maja fruit (Crescentia cujete L.) contains chemical compounds including alkaloid, flavonoid, saponin, and terpenoid, suspected as potential antipyretics. METHODS: The study aimed to determine the antipyretic activity of ethanol extract of Maja fruit. A total of 25 male white mice of the DDY strain (20-30 g). These treatments divided into three groups with a dose extract of 125, 250, 500 mg/kg BW, standard groups of ibuprofen 400 mg/kg BW, and control groups of CMC-Na 1%. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 0.1 cc of DPT vaccine-induced. Observations were made by measuring the rectal temperatures of mice using a digital thermometer before DPT vaccine injected or average temperatures, at 0 min (after DPT vaccine injected), 60, 120, 180, and 240 min after administering the test material. The differences between the positive control group, test group, and the negative control group were compared using statistical analysis using one-way variance analysis (ANOVA). The results were considered statistically when the value is (p<0.05). RESULTS: The above phytochemical screening results showed that alkaloids, flavonoids, and saponins were present in the Maja fruit powder and extract (C. cujete L.). Based on the results of the statistical analysis obtained, i.e., Group II was not significantly different from Group III and Group IV (p</=0.05) and was significantly different from Group I and Group V. Group I was significantly different from Group II, Group III and Group IV and was not significantly different from Group V (p>/=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that Maja fruit mice's antipyretic behavior at doses of 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg BW was confirmed as a result in reducing the body temperature of male mice. The 500 mg/kg BW dosage of Maja fruit extract (C. cujete L) effectively reduced fever.","Teodhora, Sholikha M, Ania A, Maruya Kusuma I",J Basic Clin Physiol Pharmacol,2021 Jun 25,Diphtheria AND Indonesia

31890394,Diphtheria or Streptococcal Pharyngitis: A Case Report Highlighting the Diagnostic Dilemma in the Post-vaccination Era.,"Diphtheria is an acute, highly infectious, toxigenic, and vaccine-preventable disease that commonly affects children under 12 years of age. The incidences of diphtheria have significantly dropped due to vaccination with diphtheria, pertussis, tetani (DPT). Recently, there is an increasing trend in reports of diphtheria throughout the world and specifically from developing countries. According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report, more than 80% of the global diphtheria cases in the post-vaccination era were from India and Indonesia. This could probably be signaling its re-emergence, which may be attributed to several factors that include incomplete immunization. Pharyngitis caused by group A Streptococcus is most frequently seen in children and can be clinically similar in presentation to diphtheria. We share our experience of managing a case of an eight-year-old child, who was clinically suspected to be suffering from diphtheria.","Kandi V, Vaish R",Cureus,2019 Nov 18,Diphtheria AND Indonesia
32645254,Diphtheria toxin-mediated transposon-driven poly (A)-trapping efficiently disrupts transcriptionally silent genes in embryonic stem cells.,"Random gene trapping is the application of insertional mutagenesis techniques that are conventionally used to inactivate protein-coding genes in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Transcriptionally silent genes are not effectively targeted by conventional random gene trapping techniques, thus we herein developed an unbiased poly (A) trap (UPATrap) method using a Tol2 transposon, which preferentially integrated into active genes rather than silent genes in ES cells. To achieve efficient trapping at transcriptionally silent genes using random insertional mutagenesis in ES cells, we generated a new diphtheria toxin (DT)-mediated trapping vector, DTrap that removed cells, through the expression of DT that was induced by the promoter activity of the trapped genes, and selected trapped clones using the neomycin-resistance gene of the vector. We found that a double-DT, the dDT vector, dominantly induced the disruption of silent genes, but not active genes, and showed more stable integration in ES cells than the UPATrap vector. The dDT vector disrupted differentiated cell lineage genes, which were silent in ES cells, and labeled trapped clone cells by the expression of EGFP upon differentiation. Thus, the dDT vector provides a systematic approach to disrupt silent genes and examine the cellular functions of trapped genes in the differentiation of target cells and development.","Bai J, Kondo R, Mayasari NI, Shigeoka T, Isotani A, Ikawa M, Sashida G, Kawaichi M, Ishida Y",Genesis,2020 Sep,Diphtheria AND Indonesia

Anti-tetanus and anti-diphtheria antibody levels were measured by ELISA at baseline and at 1, 3, 7, and 14 months after Td vaccination. All groups were comparable at baseline. Immunization triggered significant increases in anti-tetanus and anti-diphtheria IgG levels over each group's pre-Td baseline levels and those of an unvaccinated control group. Geometric mean anti-tetanus titers (GMTs) in the primaquine group were significantly higher than those of the placebo group at 1, 3, and 14 months. Anti-tetanus GMTs in placebo and chloroquine groups declined over 14 months to levels comparable to those of unvaccinated controls, but levels in the primaquine group remained significantly higher than in controls.","Fryauff DJ, Cryz SJ, Widjaja H, Mouzin E, Church LW, Sutamihardja MA, Richards AL, Subianto B, Hoffman SL",J Infect Dis,1998 Jun,Diphtheria AND Indonesia

The aims of the study were to measure 1) antibody persistence 12-18 months after a primary series, 2) immune response and safety after a booster dose of DTwP-HB-Hib. METHODS: This was a multi-center, open-labeled, prospective, interventional study. Subjects who had received complete primary dose of DTwP-HB-Hib vaccine from the previous phase III trial were recruited in this trial. Subjects were given one dose of DTwP-HB-Hib (Pentabio(R)) booster at age 18-24 months old. Diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, Hemophilus influenza type B antibodies were measured before and after booster to determine antibody persistence and immune response. Vaccine adverse events were assessed immediately and monitored until 28 days after the booster recorded with parent's diary cards. RESULTS: There were 396 subjects who completed the study. Increased proportion of seroprotected subjects from pre-booster to post-booster were noted in all vaccine antigens: 74.5 to 99.7% for diphtheria; 100 to 100% for tetanus; 40.4 to 95.5% for pertussis; 90.2 to 99.5% for hepatitis B; and 97.7 to 100% for Hib. Common systemic adverse events (AEs) were irritability (23.7-25%) and fever (39.9-45.2%). Local AEs such as redness, swelling, and induration were significantly less common in the thigh group (7.7, 11.3, and 7.1%) than in the deltoid group (28.9, 30.7, and 25%) (P < 0.001). Most AEs were mild and resolved spontaneously within three-day follow-up period.

The findings of this article are implementation of isolation and estimation technique of parameters using extended Kalman filter on the model of diphtheria transmission. From the eigenvalues of next generation matrix, the basic reproduction number is obtained. Then, the implementation of using extended Kalman filter provides the trend of the basic reproduction number of the diphtheria model with several cases: DPT only, Booster only, and a combination of DPT and booster. Based on the values of RMSE, NRMSE, and MAPE, the Extended Kalman Filter method provides significant results in estimating the basic reproduction number on actual data of diphtheria cases in West Java. We also studied the quarantined population in this article, because the rate of isolation has a significant impact on the profile of the susceptible, infected, quarantined, and recovered populations. Based on the results obtained, DPT only gives the smallest number when compared to Booster only and the combination of DPT and Booster. This is likely when DPT only is given, the body forms an immune system so giving Booster only does not provide significant results in reducing the level of effectiveness of diphtheria transmission (reducing the basic reproduction number).*This paper purposes to get the prediction of diphtheria transmission by using Extended Kalman Filter.*The basic reproduction number is also studied for the DPT only, booster only, and the combinations of DPT and booster.*The Extended Kalman Filter shows the good performance based on the RMSE, NRMSE, and MAPE.",Ghani M,MethodsX,2025 Jun,Diphtheria AND Indonesia

10427933,Oral iodine supplementation does not reduce neutralizing antibody responses to oral poliovirus vaccine.,"Iodine deficiency is a major cause of impaired mental development, goitre, and cretinism in many parts of the world. Because existing immunization programmes can be used to deliver oral iodized oil (OIO) to infants at risk, it was important to know whether OIO could adversely affect the antibody response to vaccines, such as trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in Subang, West Java, Indonesia, in which 617 eight-week-old infants received either OIO or a placebo (poppy-seed oil) during a routine visit for their first dose of OPV as part of the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). The infants received two boosters of OPV at 4-week intervals after the first dose, and were followed up when 6 months old. Neutralizing antibody titres to poliovirus serotypes 1, 2, and 3 were compared in serum samples that were taken from 478 of these infants just before the first dose of OPV and at 6 months. It was found that oral iodized oil did not reduce the antibody responses to any of the three serotypes of OPV. These results indicate that oral iodine may safely be delivered to infants at the same time as oral poliovirus vaccine according to current EPI immunization schedules.","Taffs RE, Enterline JC, Rusmil K, Muhilal, Suwardi SS, Rustama D, Djatnika, Cobra C, Semba RD, Cohen N, Asher DM",Bull World Health Organ,1999,Diphtheria AND Indonesia

Serum samples for serology analysis were collected before the first dose of bOPV (at day 0), before the second dose of bOPV (at day 60) and 30 days after the last dose of bOPV. In addition, the intensity, duration and relationship of each adverse event to the trial vaccines were assessed. Seroprotection rates after the fourth dose of bOPV were 100%, 91.6% and 99.3% for poliovirus P1, P2 and P3, respectively. Seroconversion rates after the fourth dose of bOPV were 100.0%, 93.3% and 100% for poliovirus P1, P2 and P3, respectively. There were no severe adverse events, and systemic reactions were generally mild during the 1-28 day post-vaccination period.

Whether Hib disease truly is rare or whether many cases remain undetected is unclear. METHODS: To estimate incidences of vaccine-preventable Hib pneumonia and meningitis among children younger than 2 years in Lombok, Indonesia, during 1998-2002, we undertook a hamlet-randomised, controlled, double-blind vaccine-probe study (818 hamlets). Children were immunised (WHO schedule) with diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (DTP) or DTP-PRP-T (Hib conjugate) vaccine. Vaccine-preventable disease incidences were calculated as the difference in rates of clinical outcomes between DTP and DTP-PRP-T groups. Analyses included all children who received at least one vaccine dose. FINDINGS: We enrolled 55073 children: 28147 were assigned DTP-PRP-T and 26926 DTP. The proportion of pneumonia outcomes prevented by vaccine ranged from less than 0 to 4.8%. Calculated incidences of vaccine-preventable Hib disease (per 10(5) child-years of observation) for outcome categories were: substantial alveolar consolidation or effusion, less than zero (-43 [95% CI -185 to 98]); all severe pneumonia, 264 (95% CI less than zero to 629); all clinical pneumonia, 1561 (270 to 2853); confirmed Hib meningitis, 16 (1.4 to 31); meningitis with cerebrospinal-fluid findings consistent with a bacterial aetiology, 67 (22 to 112); and admission for suspected meningitis or presenting to a clinic with convulsions, 158 (42 to 273). INTERPRETATION: Hib vaccine did not prevent the great majority of pneumonia cases, including those with alveolar consolidation. These results do not support a major role for Hib vaccine in overall pneumonia-prevention programmes. Nevertheless, the study identified high incidences of Hib meningitis and pneumonia; inclusion of Hib vaccine in routine infant immunisation programmes in Asia deserves consideration.","Gessner BD, Sutanto A, Linehan M, Djelantik IG, Fletcher T, Gerudug IK, Ingerani, Mercer D, Moniaga V, Moulton LH, Moulton LH, Mulholland K, Nelson C, Soemohardjo S, Steinhoff M, Widjaya A, Stoeckel P, Maynard J, Arjoso S",Lancet,2005 Jan 1-7,Diphtheria AND Indonesia
1729457,Depressed immune response to tetanus in children with vitamin A deficiency.,"A randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted with 236 preschool children, age 3-6 y, in Indonesia to assess immune status in mild vitamin A deficiency. The immune response to tetanus immunization was used as a measure of immune competence. Clinically normal children (n = 118) and children with mild xerophthalmia (n = 118) were randomly assigned to receive oral vitamin A (60,000 micrograms retinol equivalent) or placebo treatment for a total of four study groups. Two weeks after treatment, children were immunized with diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccine. The immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses to tetanus at baseline and 3 wk following immunization were measured by ELISA. After adjusting for previous tetanus immunization, clinically normal and xerophthalmic children receiving vitamin A had a significantly greater IgG response to tetanus than clinically normal and xerophthalmic children receiving placebo (P less than 0.05). These results suggest that children with mild vitamin A deficiency have a relative immune depression compared with children who have been supplemented to normal vitamin A levels.","Semba RD, Muhilal, Scott AL, Natadisastra G, Wirasasmita S, Mele L, Ridwan E, West KP Jr, Sommer A",J Nutr,1992 Jan,Diphtheria AND Indonesia
9395384,Lymphocyte response to tetanus toxoid among Indonesian men immunized with tetanus-diphtheria during extended chloroquine or primaquine prophylaxis.,"Immune suppression, a potential side effect of long-term chemoprophylaxis, was evaluated as part of a randomized, placebo-controlled trial that compared daily primaquine against weekly chloroquine for malaria prevention. In the last month of the year-long trial, baseline in vitro lymphoproliferative responses to tetanus toxoid were measured, and a tetanus-diphtheria (Td) immunization was administered. Proliferative responses to tetanus toxoid in each Td-immunized group increased significantly over pre-Td baselines and those of the unvaccinated control. Highest initial responses were measured in the primaquine group. The proportion of responders and the magnitude of proliferation was consistently low in the chloroquine group, and end point responses in this group were significantly below those of the placebo. These results suggest that the development and duration of the cellular response to tetanus immunization was impaired by long-term weekly chloroquine prophylaxis, while daily primaquine prophylaxis over the same time period had no inhibitory effect.","Fryauff DJ, Church LW, Richards AL, Widjaja H, Mouzin E, Ratiwayanto S, Hadiputranto H, Sutamihardja MA, Richie TL, Subianto B, Tjitra E, Hoffman SL",J Infect Dis,1997 Dec,Diphtheria AND Indonesia
2367880,Participation effect from water projects on EPI.,"It has been hypothesized that in addition to the direct health and amenity benefits of an improved water supply, there are other, more subtle, benefits to communities who participate in community-based water supply projects. A detailed empirical comparison of villages with and without community-based water projects in Indonesia and Togo suggests that such indirect benefits are substantial. Between 25 and 30% more children are immunized in villages with community-based water projects than in comparison villages which either have benefitted from non-participatory water projects, or have had no water project. From a comparison between the activities of villagers and workers in external agencies involved in water projects in the two countries, it is concluded that successful participatory water projects are best characterized as a partnership between the community and the external agency. Such projects require substantial inputs of time, resources, skill and persistence from both the community and the external agency. These inputs must be sustained by both parties in all phases--planning, construction and maintenance--if this partnership is to result in lasting improvements in water supply and other aspects of community life.","Eng E, Briscoe J, Cunningham A",Soc Sci Med,1990,Diphtheria AND Indonesia

This study deals with the ELISA for immunoglobulin G antibodies against diphtheric toxin in healthy children in kindergartens to determine the immunity status. One hundred and ninety eight samples of serum were collected from children of 18 kindergartens in West, East and South Denpasar districts and were investigated for IgG diphtheria using the ELISA method. History of immunization was obtained from the patient's immunization cards and an interview by the doctors. It was assumed to be immune when the IgG level was above 0.01 IU/ml. Eighty one out of 95 (85%) children from the control group (who had never had basic immunization) had IgG levels above 0.01 IU/ml and 81 out of 83 (97.6%) children from the group who had completed basic immunization (3 injections) had IgG level above 0.01 IU/ml. It seemed that natural infection played still a major role to develop immunity in those children.","Santoso H, Suwendra IP, Kari IK",Paediatr Indones,1990 Sep-Oct,Diphtheria AND Indonesia

37382316,Risk factors associated with childhood stunting in Indonesia: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In Indonesia, stunting is one of the most public health concerns. This study aims to systematically review and meta-analyze childhood stunting risk factors in the country. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational (cross-sectional and longitudi-nal) studies on stunting risk factors published between 2010 and 2021 based on available publications in online databases of PubMed, ProQuest, EBSCO, and google scholar. The quality of the publications was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale and organized according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis. Publication bias was examined using Egger's and Begg's tests. RESULTS: A total of 17 studies from the literature search satisfied the inclusion criteria, with 642,596 subjects. The pooled stunting prevalence was 30.9% (95% CI 25.0%-36.8%). Children born with low birth weight (POR 2.39, 2.07-2.76), female (POR 1.05, 1.03-1.08), and did not get the deworming program (1.10, 1.07-1.12) are the primary child characteristics that contributed to stunting. Meanwhile, maternal age >/= 30 years (POR 2.33, 2.23-2.44), preterm birth (POR 2.12, 2.15-2.19), and antenatal care <4 times (POR 1.25, 1.11-1.41) were among mother characteristics consistently associated with stunting. The primary household and community risk factors for stunting were food insecurity (POR 2.00, 1.37-2.92), unimproved drinking water (POR 1.42, 1.26-1.60), rural residence (POR 1.31, 1.20-1.42), and unimproved sanitation (POR 1.27, 1.12-1.44). CONCLUSIONS: A diverse range of risk factors associated with childhood stunting in In-donesia demonstrates the need to emphasize nutrition programs by scaling up to more on these determinants.","Gusnedi G, Nindrea RD, Purnakarya I, Umar HB, Andrafikar, Syafrawati, Asrawati, Susilowati A, Novianti, Masrul, Lipoeto NI",Asia Pac J Clin Nutr,2023,Stunting AND Indonesia
29770565,A review of child stunting determinants in Indonesia.,"Child stunting reduction is the first of 6 goals in the Global Nutrition Targets for 2025 and a key indicator in the second Sustainable Development Goal of Zero Hunger. The prevalence of child stunting in Indonesia has remained high over the past decade, and at the national level is approximately 37%. It is unclear whether current approaches to reduce child stunting align with the scientific evidence in Indonesia. We use the World Health Organization conceptual framework on child stunting to review the available literature and identify what has been studied and can be concluded about the determinants of child stunting in Indonesia and where data gaps remain. Consistent evidence suggests nonexclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months, low household socio-economic status, premature birth, short birth length, and low maternal height and education are particularly important child stunting determinants in Indonesia. Children from households with both unimproved latrines and untreated drinking water are also at increased risk. Community and societal factors-particularly, poor access to health care and living in rural areas-have been repeatedly associated with child stunting. Published studies are lacking on how education; society and culture; agriculture and food systems; and water, sanitation, and the environment contribute to child stunting. This comprehensive synthesis of the available evidence on child stunting determinants in Indonesia outlines who are the most vulnerable to stunting, which interventions have been most successful, and what new research is needed to fill knowledge gaps.","Beal T, Tumilowicz A, Sutrisna A, Izwardy D, Neufeld LM",Matern Child Nutr,2018 Oct,Stunting AND Indonesia
34260622,Prenatal and postnatal determinants of stunting at age 0-11 months: A cross-sectional study in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Childhood stunting remains the most challenging consequence of undernutrition because it is associated with suboptimal brain development and the subsequent increased risk of metabolic diseases and decreased earnings in adult life. The Sambas District in Indonesia has a high prevalence of stunting (28.4%), followed by underweight (25.5.%) and wasting (14.4%) among children, as well chronic energy deficiency (27%) and anemia (62%) among pregnant women. The present study sought to determine significant factors in childhood stunting with a focus on maternal and child nutrition and prenatal and postnatal determinants. METHODS: This prospective, repeat, cross-sectional study investigated factors associated with stunting among 559 infants age 0-11 months in Sambas District, Indonesia. Anthropometric measurements were performed by trained enumerators. Data from a 2016 survey of pregnant women and a 2017 survey on mothers and their children were used for postnatal data collection to quantify the prevalence of stunting at age 0-11 months. Using 20 potential predictors of stunting categorized by household characteristics, maternal characteristics, antenatal care services, and child characteristics, logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the adjusted association between stunting and these factors. RESULTS: Of 559 children analyzed, 20.8% were stunted. In the model with low birth weight (LBW) as predictor for stunting, the odds of stunting increased significantly among children who weighed <2.500 g at birth; children who had diarrhea in the past 2 weeks and children who had incomplete basic immunization coverage as infants age 9-11 months. In model without LBW, the odds of stunting increased significantly among children who had preterm at birth, short maternal stature and children who had incomplete basic immunization coverage for 9-11 months infants. CONCLUSIONS: Postnatal factors-preterm birth, low birth weight, diarrhea and complete basic immunization coverage-were associated with infant stunting in Sambas District, Indonesia. The prenatal factors such as short maternal stature were significant in the multivariate model. Policy makers, especially in the government, should recommend measures focused on those prenatal and postnatal factors to prevent stunting in children and to avoid the sequelae of childhood stunting in adult life.","Sartika AN, Khoirunnisa M, Meiyetriani E, Ermayani E, Pramesthi IL, Nur Ananda AJ",PLoS One,2021,Stunting AND Indonesia
34649393,The Effect of the Physical Factors of Parents and Children on Stunting at Birth Among Newborns in Indonesia.,"OBJECTIVES: This study examined stunting at birth and its associations with physical factors of parents and children in Indonesia. METHODS: This study analyzed secondary data from the national cross-sectional Indonesian Basic Health Survey 2018, conducted across 34 provinces and 514 districts/cities. Birth length data were available for 756 newborns. Univariable, bivariable, and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine associations between the physical factors of parents and children and stunting at birth. RESULTS: In total, 10.2% of children aged 0 months were stunted at birth (10.7% of males and 9.5% of females). Stunting at birth was associated with the mother's age at first pregnancy, parity, parents' heights, parents' ages, and gestational age. Children from mothers with short statures (height &lt;145.0 cm) and fathers with short statures (height &lt;161.9 cm) had an almost 6 times higher likelihood of being stunted at birth (adjusted odds ratio, 5.93; 95% confidence interval, 5.53 to 6.36). A higher maternal age at first pregnancy had a protective effect against stunting. However, other variables (firstborn child, preterm birth, and both parents' ages being &lt;20 or &gt;35 years) corresponded to a 2-fold higher likelihood of stunting at birth compared to the reference. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide evidence that interventions to reduce stunting aimed at pregnant females should also consider the parents' stature, age, and parity, particularly if it is the first pregnancy and if the parents are short in stature or young. Robust programs to support pregnant females and monitor children's heights from birth will help prevent intergenerational stunting.","Sari K, Sartika RAD",J Prev Med Public Health,2021 Sep,Stunting AND Indonesia

34797892,Beyond personal factors: Multilevel determinants of childhood stunting in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Stunting is still a major public health problem in low- and middle-income countries, including Indonesia. Previous studies have reported the complexities associated with understanding the determinants of stunting. This study aimed to examine the household-, subdistrict- and province-level determinants of stunting in Indonesia using a multilevel hierarchical mixed effects model. METHODS: We analyzed data for 8045 children taken from the 2007 and 2014 waves of the Indonesian Family and Life Surveys (IFLS). We included individual-, family-/household- and community-level variables in the analyses. A multilevel mixed effects model was employed to take into account the hierarchical structure of the data. Moreover, the model captured the effect of unobserved household-, subdistrict- and province-level characteristics on the probability of children being stunted. RESULTS: Our findings showed that the odds of childhood stunting vary significantly not only by individual child- and household-level characteristics but also by province- and subdistrict-level characteristics. Among the child-level covariates included in our model, dietary habits, neonatal weight, a history of infection, and sex significantly affected the risk of stunting. Household wealth status and parental education are significant household-level covariates associated with a higher risk of stunting. Finally, the risk of stunting is higher for children living in communities without access to water, sanitation and hygiene. CONCLUSIONS: Stunting is associated with not only child-level characteristics but also family- and community-level characteristics. Hence, interventions to reduce stunting should also take into account family and community characteristics to achieve effective outcomes.","Mulyaningsih T, Mohanty I, Widyaningsih V, Gebremedhin TA, Miranti R, Wiyono VH",PLoS One,2021,Stunting AND Indonesia
35066367,Determinants of malnutrition among children: A systematic review.,"OBJECTIVES: Child undernutrition is a major public health problem. Globally in 2020, 149 million children <5 y of age were estimated to be stunted (too short for age), 45 million to be wasted (too thin for height), and 38.9 million were overweight. The aim of this review was to examine previous studies to determine the factors associated with malnutrition and contribute to the existing body of evidence needed for the formulation of effective interventions. METHODS: This systematic review was conducted using the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. The Google Scholar database was used to search the studies conducted between 2012 and 2021. The included studies were searched by using some combinations of keywords and saved in Mendeley Desktop for review and referencing. RESULTS: Of 2150 articles retrieved from the Google Scholar databases, 37 met our inclusion criteria.

CONCLUSION: The most consistent factors associated with child malnutrition were maternal education, household income, maternal nutritional status, age of the child, availability of sanitation facility at home, size of family, birth order in the family, and child's birth weight. Breastfeeding and caring practices, cooking area and the fuel used, sex, and socioeconomic status of the children also contribute toward child malnutrition.",Katoch OR,Nutrition,2022 Apr,Stunting AND Indonesia
33316572,Childhood stunting and cognitive effects of water and sanitation in Indonesia.,"Close to 100 million Indonesians lack access to improved sanitation, while 33 million live without improved drinking water. Indonesia is home to the second largest number of open defecators in the world, behind India. Repeated exposure to fecal pathogens, especially common in areas where open defecation is practiced, can cause poor absorption and nutrient loss through diarrhea and poor gut function, leading to undernutrition, growth stunting and irreversible impairment of health, development, learning and earnings - the effects of which outlast a lifetime. Using data from a sample of over six thousand children in the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS), a household socioeconomic panel representative of over 80 percent of the Indonesian population, we examine the relationship between poor household and community water and sanitation services and childhood stunting and cognitive development. We find that children living in households that have access to improved sanitation when they are under 2 years of age are approximately 5 percentage points less likely to end up being stunted. Community rates of sanitation are also important. Children living in open defecation free communities during this critical development window are more than 10 percentage points less likely to be stunted, than children in communities where all other households defecate in the open. Further, cognitive test scores are adversely affected by open defecation. These findings suggest that owning a toilet and living in a community where most of one's neighbors own a toilet are important drivers of child growth and development.","Cameron L, Chase C, Haque S, Joseph G, Pinto R, Wang Q",Econ Hum Biol,2021 Jan,Stunting AND Indonesia
33843538,Household structure and concurrent stunting and overweight among young children in Indonesia.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of household type and household composition with concurrent stunting and overweight in young children from urban and rural Indonesia. DESIGN: This study is a secondary data analysis using a nationally representative cross-sectional survey. Household structure was analysed as household type, household size, number of working adults, number of dependent adults and children, and household head's gender. We defined 'concurrent stunting and overweight' as height-for-age Z-score <-2 and weight-for-height Z-score >+2 based on WHO growth standards. Multivariable logistic regression to test the aforementioned association was performed separately for urban and rural areas. SETTING: Data were from Indonesia Basic Heath Research 2013. PARTICIPANTS: Children aged 2-5 years (n 45 050). RESULTS: The prevalence of concurrent stunting and overweight children was 5.6 %. In rural areas, this prevalence differed significantly by household types and the highest prevalence was among children in nuclear two-parent households (6.8 %). In rural areas, children in extended households had lower odds of concurrent stunting and overweight than those from nuclear households (OR = 0.73, 95 % CI 0.59, 0.92). In urban areas, household size and number of working adults were significantly associated with the decreased odds of concurrent stunting and overweight in children. CONCLUSIONS: Household structure was associated with children's concurrent stunting and overweight in urban and rural regions of Indonesia. The patterns of the association might differ between urban and rural regions, but no significant interaction term was found.","Ciptanurani C, Chen HJ",Public Health Nutr,2021 Jun,Stunting AND Indonesia
35877770,Stunting among children under two years in Indonesia: Does maternal education matter?,"BACKGROUND: Measuring height for age is one of the essential indicators for evaluating children's growth. The study analyzes the association between maternal education and stunting among children under two years in Indonesia. METHODS: The study employed secondary data from the 2017 Indonesia Nutritional Status Monitoring Survey. The unit of analysis was children under two years, and the study obtained weighted samples of 70,293 children. Besides maternal education, other independent variables analyzed in this study were residence, maternal age, maternal marital status, maternal employment, children's age, and gender. In the final stage, the study occupied a multivariate test by binary logistic regression test. RESULTS: The results show the proportion of stunted children under two years in Indonesia nationally is 20.1%. Mothers in primary school and under education categories are 1.587 times more likely than mothers with a college education to have stunted children under two years (95% CI 1.576-1.598). Meanwhile, mothers with a junior high school education have a chance of 1.430 times more than mothers with a college education to have stunted children under two years (95% CI 1.420-1.440). Moreover, mothers with education in the senior high school category have 1.230 times more chances than mothers with a college education to have stunted children under two years (95% CI 1.222-1.238). CONCLUSION: The study concluded that the maternal education level was associated with stunting children under two years in Indonesia. The lower the mother's level of education, the higher the chances of a mother having stunted children under two years.","Laksono AD, Wulandari RD, Amaliah N, Wisnuwardani RW",PLoS One,2022,Stunting AND Indonesia
35813667,Impact of Stunting on Development of Children between 1-3 Years of Age.,"BACKGROUND: Stunting occurs due to chronic malnutrition and is a major problem for children in developing countries. It is important to evaluate the impact of stunting on the development of children. This study aimed to investigate the impact of stunting on the development of children between 1-3 years of age. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from July 2020 to March 2021 in Surabaya, Indonesia. A questionnaire and growth assessment were done, following the development measurement to stunted and non-stunted children who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Development was measured by the Denver Developmental Screening Test II (DDST-II), and Cognitive Adaptive Test/Clinical Linguistic & Auditory Milestone (CAT/CLAMS) scales. RESULTS: Three hundred children are included in this study, consisting of 150 stunted and 150 non-stunted children. Stunted children had a higher risk to be suspected of delayed development compared to non-stunted children. The Crude Odd Ratio was 2.98, 4.24, 4.75 with the p-value 0.006, 0.001. and 0.001 respectively. The Adjusted Odd Ratio was 0.34, 0.24, 0.21 with p-value of 0.008, 0.001, and 0.001 respectively. CONCLUSION: Stunting is associated with suspected development delay among children 1-3 years of age.

35306826,Determinants of socioeconomic and rural-urban disparities in stunting: evidence from Indonesia.,"INTRODUCTION: Stunting continues to be a prominent health problem in Indonesia. Stunting prevalence is higher in children from poor families or living in rural areas; however, there has been a lack of information on predictors of stunting disparities and stunting risk factors by socioeconomic status (SES) and location of residence (rural or urban). This study aims to examine the factors associated with stunting by SES and rural-urban status, and to assess determinants of stunting disparities by SES and rural-urban status in Indonesia. METHODS: This study analysed data from the Indonesian Family and Life Survey (IFLS) wave 5, conducted in 2014. Data for 3887 children aged 0-59 months, including individual, family and community variables, were analysed. Stratified logistic regression was conducted to assess differences in determinants of stunting by household expenditure (poor or non-poor, representing SES) and rural-urban status. The Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition method was used to assess determinants of stunting disparities by household expenditure and rural-urban status. RESULTS: The analyses showed differences in factors associated with stunting among children in rural versus urban areas, or children in poor versus non-poor households. Mother's short stature and low education level increased the odds of stunting across all groups. However, in children of families with a higher household expenditure, unhealthy snacks were a significant predictor of stunting (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.47). This finding was not found in other groups. Good sanitation significantly reduced stunting in children in families with higher household expenditure and children from urban communities. Nutrition services were significantly associated with stunting in poor children and children from urban areas. The decomposition analyses showed that differences in characteristics explained 55.35% stunting disparity by household expenditure. Meanwhile, rural-urban disparity was mostly explained by differences in responses (56.20%), with low birth weight and unexplained variables as predominant contributors. CONCLUSION: There were slight differences in stunting determinants by household expenditure and rural-urban status in Indonesia. Stunting disparities were attributed to differences in characteristics and responses between the less and more advantaged populations. To improve the effectiveness of stunting reduction programs, specific interventions tailored to address the differences between the more and less advantaged population are needed.","Widyaningsih V, Mulyaningsih T, Rahmawati FN, Adhitya D",Rural Remote Health,2022 Mar,Stunting AND Indonesia
38709786,Stunting and its association with education and cognitive outcomes in adulthood: A longitudinal study in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Stunting is associated with adverse outcomes in adulthood. This article specifically aims to analyse the relationship between childhood stunting and education as well as cognitive outcomes for adults in Indonesia. METHODS: Pooled data from wave one (1) and two (2) of the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS) in 1993 and 1997 identified a sub-sample of 4,379 children aged 0-5 by their height-for-age (HAZ) to be compared for their differences in educational outcomes and cognitive abilities in 2014. HAZ was used to proxy relative height to determine stunting status based on 2006 WHO child's growth standards. Education and cognitive abilities outcomes include years of schooling, age of school entry, grade repetition, and scores for cognitive and math tests. The study employs estimation models of pooled regressions and instrumental variable (IV) to address problems of endogeneity and bias from omitted variables. RESULTS: Stunting and relatively small stature had significant associations with cognitive development, and they worked as intermediaries to cognitive developmental barriers as manifested in reduced educational outcomes. A lack of one SD in HAZ was associated with 0.6 years shortened length of the school, 3% higher chances of dropouts from secondary school, and 0.10-0.23 SD lowered cognitive and numerical scores. Similarly, stunting is associated with decrease cognitive test scores by 0.56-0.8 SD compared to non-stunting, two years less schooling, and 0.4 years of delayed entry to school. As for cognitive abilities, stunting is associated with lower cognitive and numerical abilities by 0.38-0.82 z-scores. CONCLUSION: Growth retardation during childhood in Indonesia was associated with lower cognitive abilities, particularly during school age, and this correlation faded as individuals grew up. Subsequently, growth retardation is significantly linked to lower educational outcomes. Impaired growth has implications for reduced lifetime earnings potential mediated by diminished cognitive capacity and lower educational attainment. The finding suggests that development in Indonesia during recent decades has not provided an adequate environment to enable children to achieve their potential educational outcomes.","Lestari E, Siregar A, Hidayat AK, Yusuf AA",PLoS One,2024,Stunting AND Indonesia
38450260,Parental stature as a risk factor for stunting in Indonesia: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Stunting is defined by height of more than two standard deviations below the World Health Organization's (WHO) child growth standard median. It is a significant nutritional problem in developing countries, where in 2021, Indonesia recorded a stunting prevalence at 24.4%, slightly higher than the global prevalence (22%). Reducing the prevalence of stunting has been the focus of the current administration in the Indonesian government, as delineated in the 2020-2024 National Medium-Term Development Plan. Globally, many studies have addressed parental stature as a risk factor of stunting. However, systematic reviews that summarized and critically appraised the relationship between parental stature and the incidence of stunting in Indonesia was scarce. This systematic review aimed to assess parental stature as a risk factor for stunting among Indonesian toddlers. Studies were searched through PubMed (MEDLINE), Google Scholar and Mendeley. Studies on Indonesian toddlers under five years old living in Indonesia were included. The quality of the included studies was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool. Data were extracted using a standardized data extraction form and were analyzed using Cochrane's RevMan 5.3. Twenty-seven prospective and retrospective cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies were included with a total 4041 children. Out of 27 included studies, eight were found to be of low, seven of moderate and twelve of high quality. The result showed that parental stature was associated with the incidence of stunting among toddlers in Indonesia, either the mother only (odds ratio (OR) 1.92; 95% confidence interval (95%CI: 1.71-2.15), the father only (OR 5.21; 95%CI: 1.71-15.86) or both parents (OR 3.01; 95%CI: 2.41-3.75). However, studies on father and both parental statures suffered from substantial heterogeneity, imprecision and mixed qualities, therefore, they should be cautiously interpreted.","Amriviana MP, Khairunnisa C, Sasongko TH",Narra J,2023 Aug,Stunting AND Indonesia
37434666,Cigarette Smoke Exposure and Stunting Among Under-five Children in Rural and Poor Families in Indonesia.,"Cigarette smoke exposure in mothers and children is highly prevalent in Asia, especially among rural and poor families. Second-hand smoke exposure might affect the nutritional status of children. Despite the emerging double burden of malnutrition and the very high prevalence of smoking in Indonesia, few studies have examined the effects of parental smoking on children's nutritional status. This study aims to measure the relationship between family smoking behavior and the occurrence of stunting in children under 5 years. This cross-sectional study used a purposive sampling technique, with 221 households with children aged 0 to 59 months from poor areas in Indonesia. Exposure to cigarette smoke is assessed using The Secondhand Smoke Exposure Scale questionnaire. The outcome measured is child stunting (height-for-age Z-score). The prevalence of stunting was estimated at 145 (65.6%). Children living with smoking parents were counted for 157 (71%), and most smoking exposure comes from fathers 147 (67.4%). The predictors of stunting in children under 5 years were a smoker father with (AOR 1.8; 95% CI 1.281-4.641), both parents are smokers increasing the risk of stunting with (COR 3.591; 95% CI 1.67-3.77), being exposed of smoke for more than 3 hours a day increase the risk of stunted children (COR 2.05; 95% CI 1.214-3.629), and using traditional cigarette or kretek expand the risk of stunting (AOR 3.19; 95% CI 1.139-67.785). The findings demonstrate the negative impact of parental smoking on children's growth, reinforcing the importance of reducing smoking prevalence by imposing a smoke-free home policy in the stunting prevention strategy.","Muchlis N, Yusuf RA, Rusydi AR, Mahmud NU, Hikmah N, Qanitha A, Ahsan A",Environ Health Insights,2023,Stunting AND Indonesia
28244712,"Household dietary diversity and child stunting in East Java, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: More than one-quarter of under-five children in the developing world are stunted, and those with poor nutrient intake are at risk of irreversible cognitive impairment. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between dietary diversity and child stunting in an Indonesian context. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Dietary diversity was assessed using a maternal-reported checklist of 12 food groups, summed as a Household Dietary Diversity Score. Stunting was defined as <=-2.0 height-for-age z-score by WHO-Anthro 2005. Trained interviewers administered the household dietary diversity questionnaire to 768 households with children aged <5 years in East Java, Indonesia. Logistic regression models were constructed to test the association between dietary diversity and child stunting. RESULTS: The prevalence of child stunting was 39.4%, and the percentage of households consuming food groups high in protein and calcium, like dairy products (41%), and meat/poultry, (65%) was lower compared with other food groups. The unadjusted model revealed that higher dietary diversity scores were associated with lower likelihood of child stunting (OR=0.89; 95% CI=0.80-0.98). This relationship remained significant after adjustment for family size, maternal literacy, food expenditure, breastfeeding, energy, and protein intake (OR=0.89; 95% CI=0.80-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: The dietary diversity score was moderate, with consumption of dairy products and meat/poultry lowest among 12 food groups. Hence, population interventions should focus on promoting food groups currently lacking in maternal and child diet, including those rich in growth-promoting nutrients like dairy, meat/poultry. These results, from an Indonesian context, confirm the widely observed protective relationship between dietary diversity and child stunting.","Mahmudiono T, Sumarmi S, Rosenkranz RR",Asia Pac J Clin Nutr,2017 Mar,Stunting AND Indonesia
37663311,"The association of sociodemographic, nutrition, and sanitation on stunting in children under five in rural area of West Java Province in Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: The prevalence of stunting in Indonesia has decreased gradually. The strategy to reduce stunting is currently prioritized on improving socio-economic levels, fulfilling food intake, and sanitation conditions. This study aims to analyze the association between sociodemographics, nutrition, and sanitation on stunting in rural West Java Province in Indonesia. DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in May-August 2022 among 247 mother-children pairs, selected by systematic random sampling from a rural area of West Java Province in Indonesia. The sociodemographic characteristics were measured using a structured questionnaire. The nutritional status of the children under five was assessed by length/height-for-age (HAZ), and was calculated using WHO Anthro software. Sanitation is assessed using observation and interviews with a structured questionnaire. RESULTS: The prevalence of stunting in children under five was 20.7% (5.3% severely stunted and 15.4% stunted). Binary logistic regression analysis using SPSS version 22.0 show that mother's height as the dominant factor associated with stunting in children under five (AOR = 3.45, 95% CI: 1.12-4.67, p = 0.008). In addition, children's age (AOR = 0.250, 95% CI: 0.104-0.598, p = 0.002); balanced diet practices (AOR = 1.57, 95% CI: 0.965-2.56, p = 0.069), and building materials (AOR = 1.869, 95% CI: 0.87-4.00, p = 0.108 are also related to stunting in children under five. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to improve maternal nutrition need to be carried out from the period before pregnancy to the first 1000 days of life. Education on healthy home indicators, especially the use of this type of building materials for houses, needs to be done to improve sanitation as an effort to prevent stunting in children under five.","Permatasari TAE, Chadirin Y, Ernirita, Elvira F, Putri BA",J Public Health Res,2023 Jul,Stunting AND Indonesia
35542385,Problem Nutrients and Food-Based Recommendations for Pregnant Women and Under-Five Children in High-Stunting Districts in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Stunting and anemia in pregnant women and under-five children remain a challenge in developing countries, including Indonesia. One of the significant contributors to these problems is inadequate nutrient intake. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to identify, using a linear programming (LP) approach, problem nutrients and optimized food-based recommendations for under-five children and pregnant women in 10 stunting-prioritized districts in Indonesia. METHODS: LP analysis was done using the Optifood tool on dietary data collected using single 24-h dietary recall in the National Monitoring of Nutrient Consumption (Pemantauan Konsumsi Gizi), conducted by the Ministry of Health from 10 stunting-prioritized districts in Indonesia. Problem nutrients and nutrient-dense foods were identified, and all alternative food-based recommendations or complementary feeding recommendations were compared to identify which recommendation will best contribute to fulfill dietary adequacy. RESULTS: The number of problem nutrients in each district ranged from 0 to 7 nutrients for under-five children and 1 to 6 nutrients for pregnant women. The top 3 problem nutrients were: iron, zinc, and folate (for children aged 6-11 mo); zinc, folate, and calcium (for 12-23-mo-olds and 24-35-mo-olds); folate, zinc, and vitamin C/riboflavin (for 36-59-mo-olds); and iron, folate, and calcium (for pregnant women). The findings showed that problem nutrients identified using LP were in line with nutritional problems in under-five children (stunting and anemia) and pregnant women (anemia). Food-based recommendations (FBRs)/complementary feeding recommendations were developed that best meet dietary adequacy for the nutrients. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the similarity in stunting prevalence across the districts, there was variation in number and types of problem nutrients. The developed FBRs that promoted nutrient-dense foods suited to the problem nutrients in each area need to be promoted to improve nutrient intakes of under-five children and pregnant women in these areas with high stunting prevalence.","Fahmida U, Pramesthi IL, Kusuma S, Wurjandaru G, Izwardy D",Curr Dev Nutr,2022 May,Stunting AND Indonesia
38045965,"Comparison of high and low stunting reduction groups using IFE-EFE matrix analysis in Central Java Province, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: The results of the 2021 Indonesian Nutritional Status Study (Studi Status Gizi Indonesia, SSGI) showed a 6.8% declining prevalence of stunting in Central Java from 2019 to 2021. However, the prevalence decreases in the regency level of Central Java varied from 0.1 to 20.3%. This study aimed to analyze the external and internal factors that influenced the stunting reduction prevalence in Central Java Province, Indonesia. METHODS: This qualitative study was conducted over 2 months, from April to May 2022. In-depth interviews were used to explore the supporting factors (external, internal, and strategies) and the challenges (internal, external, and solutions) in implementing stunting reduction acceleration programs. The supporting factors and challenges were compared between the groups with high Gro, Sra, Kla, and Pek (GSKP) and low Sur, Mag, Teg, and Pat (SMTP) reduction prevalence. Data were analyzed using internal factor evaluation (IFE) and external factor evaluation (EFE). RESULTS: In quadrant II, the high-reduction group (GSKP) had IFE and EFE scores of 2.61 and 2.76, respectively. In quadrant IV, the low-reduction group (SMTP) had IFE and EFE scores of 1.86 and 1.62, respectively. The high-reduction group (GSKP) was better than the low-reduction group (SMTP) in using external opportunities and internal strengths by avoiding external threats and minimizing the weakness in the stunting reduction acceleration program in each area. The existence of superior programs and innovations were the strengths that differentiated the high and low groups. Conversely, the low-stunting reduction group struggled to overcome major challenges, especially lacking leadership capacity. From the outside, lack of program sustainability at the village level and budget restraint were the threats found in both groups. CONCLUSION: Compared with the low-stunting reduction group, the high group could maximize their strengths and use the opportunities to implement stunting reduction programs.","Samsudin M, Hapsari PW, Kartasurya MI, Syauqy A, Isnawati M, Wati EK, Nurcahyani YD, Fuada N, Suyatno S, Dewantiningrum J, Sunarto S, Nuryanto N",Front Public Health,2023,Stunting AND Indonesia
35586077,Factors Affecting the Knowledge and Motivation of Health Cadres in Stunting Prevention Among Children in Indonesia.,"PURPOSE: Stunting is a public health problem in Indonesia with a relatively high incidence, thereby making its prevention a priority for the Indonesian government. It potentially causes short and long effects on the quality of human resources as well as the productivity of stunted children when they grow up. Therefore, prevention and early detection efforts are needed by health professionals and cadres. Earlier studies have identified complexities associated with the determinant factors of stunting. This study aims to examine the association between sociodemographic factors as well as the knowledge and motivation of health cadres in stunting prevention in West Java. METHODS: A correlational study with a cross-sectional approach was conducted on health cadres samples from 8 districts/cities in West Java Province namely Karawang, Tasikmalaya, Garut, Bandung, Subang, Sukabumi, Cianjur, and West Bandung. A total of 363 health cadres participated and the sampling technique used is the stratified method. The data were collected using a questionnaire developed specifically for this study and were analyzed using a correlation with chi-square test and presented in the form of a frequency distribution. RESULTS: The results showed the majority of health cadres namely 81.27% had good knowledge, which was significantly influenced by education level and marital status with a P-value <0.05. Meanwhile, approximately half of the respondents had moderate motivation with 47.66%, while one-third or 39.12% had high motivation. This motivation was significantly influenced by education level, marital status, and age with p <0.05. CONCLUSION: Based on the results, it was concluded that the roles and functions of health cadres need to be improved in the prevention and early detection of stunting in West Java by providing continuous guidance, stunting prevention training, and award presentations.","Mediani HS, Hendrawati S, Pahria T, Mediawati AS, Suryani M",J Multidiscip Healthc,2022,Stunting AND Indonesia
37663225,The Association of Children's Blood Lead Levels and Prevalence of Stunting in Tin Mining Area in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Metal mining and smelting activities are regarded as major sources of heavy metals such as lead, mercury, arsenic and cadmium in the environment and in humans living at the surrounding area. Among others, lead can enter and accumulate in the human body and be very influential in children's growth and development. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the association between children's blood lead levels and stunting in a mining area in Indonesia. METHODS: A cross-sectional design was implemented by involving 193 children living in surrounding tin mining in Bangka Island, Indonesia. Venous blood was drawn and blood lead level was measured by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Stunting status was measured by anthropometry standing height and converted to sexand age-specific Z-scores based on World Health Organization (WHO) growth reference. Children's dietary intake was assessed using 24-hour dietary recall method. Statistics of chi-square test and multiple logistic regression were performed for the analyses. FINDINGS: The geometric mean of Blood Lead Levels (BLLs) was 5.5 microg/dl (+/- 2.6 microg/dl; 95% CI: 5.1-5.9). The interquartile range of BLLs and height for age Z-score (HAZ) were 3.0 mug/dl and -1.5, respectively. The data revealed that 23.3% of children were stunted (HAZ < -2). The multiple logistic regression models suggest that elevated BLLs were an independent predictor of the stunting. The odds stunted blood lead concentration was elevated about 10times higher [adjusted odd ratio (AOR) = 9.75 (95% Confidence interval (CI): 3.1-30.7); p < 0.001] in comparison to the odds of normal BLLs.The BLLs of children at ages two to nine years were found associated with stunting after controlling of the mother›s education, residence and the intake of energy, protein, zinc, vitamin A, calcium and phosphorus. CONCLUSION: The study suggested that living in surrounding tin mining was dangerous for children›s health and their development.","Zarmawi R, Haryanto B",Ann Glob Health,2023,Stunting AND Indonesia
37601326,"The Influence of Mother's Employment, Family Income, and Expenditure on Stunting Among Children Under Five: A Cross-Sectional Study in Indonesia.","INTRODUCTION: It is widely acknowledged that the socioeconomic circumstances of a family income are correctly reflected in that family expenditures. The dietary habits of families are influenced by socioeconomic circumstances that may affect stunting. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the household economic predictor stunting (mother's employment, family income, and family expenditure) in children under five. METHODS: This study used a cross-sectional design. Six districts and cities have been chosen as study areas based on the areas with the highest incidence of stunting in West Java, Indonesia. This study conducted specifically from October to December 2018. Data were examined using descriptive statistics (frequency distribution) and a Spearman Rank bivariate test. A logistic regression was employed to determine the elements that serve as predictors of stunting. RESULTS: A total of 731 women with children under five participated in the study. A bivariate analysis showed that mother's employment had an association with stunting among children under five (p = 0.014). Meanwhile, family income and expenditure are not statistically significant associated with stunting (p > 0.05). A multivariate analysis showed that mother's employment was a stunting predictor with odd ratio (OR) 1.810 (p = 0.017). The OR value means that mothers who do not work have a 1.810 chance for their children to experience stunting compared with mothers who have work. However, family income and expenditure have negative projected values (p = 0.580 and p = 0.398, respectively). CONCLUSION: Children under five who are stunted are potentially predictive with mothers' employment, with a chance is higher in mother who do not work. However, family income and expenditure are not predictive of stunting.","Rahayuwati L, Komariah M, Sari CWM, Yani DI, Hermayanti Y, Setiawan A, Hastuti H, Maulana S, Kohar K",J Multidiscip Healthc,2023,Stunting AND Indonesia
36422922,Intestinal Parasitic Infection and Nutritional Status in Children under Five Years Old: A Systematic Review.,"Intestinal parasitic infections are common infectious diseases causing many health problems and impaired growth and physical development.. Children under five years old are the most vulnerable to infections, due to their immature immunity and feeding and exploratory behaviours. This systematic review aimed to assess the relationship between intestinal parasitic infections and undernutrition among children under 5 years old. Fifteen studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were classified as high-quality studies. Twelve parasites were reported, including Ascaris lumbricoides, Cryptosporodium spp., Entamoeba histolytica, Enterobius vermicularis, Giardia lamblia, hookworm, Hymenolepis nana, Strongyloides sterocalis, Taenia spp. and Trichuris trichuria. Ascariasis is the most reported infection, with a prevalence ranging from 10.77% in Ethiopia to 57.14% in Malaysia, and is correlated with stunting (OR 2.17 (95% CI 1.14, 4.13), p = 0.02). Giardiasis is the second most reported infection, with a prevalence ranging from 4.43% in Ethiopia to 66.33% in the Central African Republic, and is related to an increased risk of stunting (OR 2.34 (95% CI 1.07, 5.10), p = 0.03)), wasting (OR 2.90 (95% CI 1.12, 7.49, p = 0.03)), and being underweight (OR 1.53 (95% CI 1.02, 2.29, p = 0.04)). The third and fourth most prevalent infections are T. trichiura and hookworm infections. Intestinal parasitic infections can occur very early in life and cause significant growth retardation. It is important to understand the prevalence and effects of infection based on the parasite species in order to implement therapeutic interventions and prevention controls.","Fauziah N, Aviani JK, Agrianfanny YN, Fatimah SN",Trop Med Infect Dis,2022 Nov 12,Stunting AND Indonesia

The study design was qualitative with an implementation research approach at District Cirebon, Indonesia. Data were collected through in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, study documents, and 6 months of participant observation. We recruited 172 respondents. The assessment instrument used was formed on was implementation outcomes variables. Data were analyzed through coding, categorizing and thematic content analysis based on a predetermined theme. Comparative cross district activity-site analysis was applied between sub-districts and villages. The implementation outcome variables for the convergence action policy were performed well at the district level, in line with the central government's adequate regulation, control, and budget. Meanwhile, the sub-district and village levels only performed aspects of acceptability, appropriateness, and coverage for specific interventions. The acceptability level in the village was only partially running. The barriers at the sub-district and village levels were issues of commitment, staff capacity, and poor coordination. Superficial understanding and capacity weaknesses drove the convergence of the stunting reduction responsibility back into the burden of the health sector at the forefront. Local politics also colored the implementation in the village.","Herawati DMD, Sunjaya DK",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2022 Oct 20,Stunting AND Indonesia
37946290,"Correlation between gut microbiota composition, enteric infections and linear growth impairment: a case-control study in childhood stunting in Pidie, Aceh, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: Gut microbiota is pivotal in maintaining children's health and well-being. The ingestion of enteric pathogens and dysbiosis lead to Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED), which is essential in stunting pathogenesis. The roles of gut microbiome and enteric infections have not been explored comprehensively in relation to childhood stunting in Indonesia. This study aimed to determine the correlation between gut microbiota composition, enteric infections, and growth biomarker, Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1), in stunted children from Pidie, Aceh, Indonesia. METHODS: This study was a case-control study involving 42 subjects aged 24 to 59 months, comprising 21 stunted children for the case and 21 normal children for the control group. The IGF-1 serum level was quantified using ELISA. The gut microbiome profiling was conducted using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. The expression of enteric pathogens virulence genes was determined using quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay. The correlations of observed variables were analysed using suitable statistical analyses. RESULTS: The result showed that the IGF-1 sera levels in stunted were lower than those in normal children (p </= 0.001). The abundance of Firmicutes (50%) was higher than Bacteroidetes (34%) in stunted children. The gut microbiome profile of stunted children showed enriched genera such as Blautia, Dorea, Collinsella, Streptococcus, Clostridium sensu stricto 13, Asteroleplasma and Anaerostipes. Meanwhile the depleted genera comprised Prevotella, Lactococcus, Butyrivibrio, Muribaculaceae, Alloprevotella, Akkermansia, Enterococcus, Terrisporobacter and Turicibacter. The abundance of water biological contaminants such as Aeromonas, Stappiaceae, and Synechococcus was also higher in stunted children compared to normal children. The virulence genes expression of Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (aaiC), Enterotoxigenic E. coli (estA), Enteropathogenic E. coli (eaeA), Shigella/Enteroinvasive E. coli (ipaH3) and Salmonella enterica (ompC) in stunted was higher than in normal children (p </= 0.001), which negatively correlated to height and level of IGF-1. CONCLUSION: The present study showed the distinctive gut microbiome profile of stunted and normal children from Pidie, Aceh, Indonesia. The gut microbiota of stunted children revealed dysbiosis, comprised several pro-inflammatory, metabolic abnormalities and high-fat/low-fiber diet-related taxa, and expressed virulence genes of enteric pathogens. These findings provide evidence that it is imperative to restore dysbiosis and preserve the balance of gut microbiota to support linear growth in children.","Rinanda T, Riani C, Artarini A, Sasongko L",Gut Pathog,2023 Nov 9,Stunting AND Indonesia

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a stunting super app, a one-stop app designed to prevent and manage stunting in Indonesia. METHODS: This study consisted of three stages. Stage 1 used a 3-round Delphi study involving 12 experts. In stage 2, 4 experts and a parent of children with stunted growth created an Android app containing stunting educational materials. In stage 3, a pilot study involving a control group was conducted to evaluate parents' knowledge about stunting prevention through the app and standard interventions. RESULTS: In the Delphi study, 11 consensus statements were extracted; arranged in three major themes, including maternal health education, child health education, and environmental education; and applied in the form of the Sistem Evaluasi Kesehatan Anak Tumbuh Ideal (SEHATI) app. This app was assessed using a content validity index, with a cumulative agreement of >/=80% among the 5 individuals. The pilot study showed an increase in the knowledge of mothers of toddlers with stunted growth before and after the educational intervention (P=.001). CONCLUSIONS: The SEHATI app provides educational content on stunting prevention that can increase the knowledge of mothers of toddlers with stunted growth.","Erika KA, Fadilah N, Latif AI, Hasbiah N, Juliaty A, Achmad H, Bustamin A",JMIR Hum Factors,2024 Dec 17,Stunting AND Indonesia
36615889,Family Household Characteristics and Stunting: An Update Scoping Review.,"Stunting remains a public health concern in developing countries. Factors related to stunting have been categorized using various frameworks. Family plays an important role in providing nutrients for children; however, no review specifies this aspect for identifying family characteristics related to stunting. This study aimed to identify family household characteristics related to stunting among children aged less than 5 years. A scoping review was undertaken with sources from PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus, using the keywords ""family characteristics"" AND ""growth"". Inclusion criteria were (1) correlational study; (2) published between 2018 and 31 July 2022; (3) families with children under the age of 5 years; and (4) independent variable any measure of stunting factors from family and household factors. Of 376 articles, only 20 met the inclusion criteria of the study. The family household characteristics included individual factors (sex age, history of diarrhea, and birthplace), family factors (family headship, primary caregiver/mother, social-cultural orientation, and family system factors), and environmental factors. Various child variables, family factors, and environmental factors (the type of home, floor type, water access, source of drinking water, and household electricity) were identified as being associated with stunting. Therefore, these factors should be evaluated to prevent and control stunting, and they should be incorporated into health programs targeting stunting.","Yani DI, Rahayuwati L, Sari CWM, Komariah M, Fauziah SR",Nutrients,2023 Jan 2,Stunting AND Indonesia
38784492,"Safe Drinking Water, Sanitation and Mother's Hygiene Practice as Stunting Risk Factors: A Case Control Study in a Rural Area of Ciawi Sub-district, Tasikmalaya District, West Java, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: Stunting is associated with disorders of the small intestines caused by environmental factors and poor hygiene practices. Prevention of stunting should be conducted in the first 1,000 days of life; namely, from conception until the child is two years old. This research aimed to analyze the relationship between environmental risk factors and maternal personal hygiene with the incidence of stunting in children aged 6-23 months. METHODS: This study was conducted using a case-control design, with a total sample of 212 (106 cases and 106 controls) enrolled purposively. Data were collected through interviews using a questionnaire. The analysis used chisquare tests and multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: The results of multivariate analysis showed the independent variables that have a significant association on the incidence of stunting are access to safe drinking water and maternal hygiene practices. The external variables that have a significant relationship is birth length and feeding practice. CONCLUSION: Having no access to safe drinking water, not proper sanitation, and poor maternal hygiene practices have a higher risk of stunting in children aged 6-23 months. The implications of this research include the need for increased access to a safe environment and improvement of mother's behavior as essential efforts to prevent stunting.","Novianti S, Huriyati E, Padmawati RS",Ethiop J Health Sci,2023 Nov,Stunting AND Indonesia
38818278,Stunting and Gut Microbiota: A Literature Review.,"Stunting, a condition characterized by impaired growth and development in children, remains a major public health concern worldwide. Over the past decade, emerging evidence has shed light on the potential role of gut microbiota modulation in stunting. Gut microbiota dysbiosis has been linked to impaired nutrient absorption, chronic inflammation, altered short-chain fatty acid production, and perturbed hormonal and signaling pathways, all of which may hinder optimal growth in children. This review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of existing research exploring the bidirectional relationship between stunting and the gut microbiota. Although stunting can alter the gut microbial community, microbiota dysbiosis may exacerbate it, forming a vicious cycle that sustains the condition. The need for effective preventive and therapeutic strategies targeting the gut microbiota to combat stunting is also discussed. Nutritional interventions, probiotics, and prebiotics are among the most promising approaches to modulate the gut microbiota and potentially ameliorate stunting outcomes. Ultimately, a better understanding of the gut microbiota-stunting nexus is vital for guiding evidence-based interventions that can improve the growth and development trajectory of children worldwide, making substantial strides toward reducing the burden of stunting in vulnerable populations.","Hardjo J, Selene NB",Pediatr Gastroenterol Hepatol Nutr,2024 May,Stunting AND Indonesia
35089957,Understanding the role of village fund and administrative capacity in stunting reduction: Empirical evidence from Indonesia.,"The Indonesian government launched various programs to handle stunting cases, including village funds. This paper examined the effects of village fund programs and village apparatuses' capacities to combat stunting based on aggregate data at the district level in Indonesia. Using descriptive data analysis and fixed effect panel regression, we observed that village fund programs could significantly reduce Indonesia's stunting prevalence, especially outside Java. It also revealed that the increasing education of regional leaders does not necessarily positively impact leaders' skills in handling stunting. At the same time, the number of village officials has a statistically significant influence on reducing stunting prevalence. It advised that the village budget fund can support national priorities in tackling the prevalence of stunting. Furthermore, it is essential to build the capacity of the village head for increasing awareness of health activities, especially early prevention of stunting, in addition to an adequate number of officials.","Indra J, Khoirunurrofik K",PLoS One,2022,Stunting AND Indonesia
38458063,Determinants of concurrent wasting and stunting among children 6 to 23 mo in Indonesia.,"OBJECTIVES: Concurrent wasting and stunting (WaSt) in a child is a health problem that leads to detrimental effects. However, to our knowledge, there is limited research regarding the prevalence and determinants of WaSt, including in Indonesia. The aim of this study was to analyze the prevalence and determinants of WaSt in children 6 to 23 mo of age. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted with data sets from the Indonesia Nutritional Status Survey (INSS). Data was collected between January and December 2021. About 15 641 children, ages 23 mo, were included. A chi(2) analysis examined the association between the dependent and independent variables. A multivariate test analyzed the risk for the independent variable to the dependent, seen through the adjusted odds ratio (aOR). RESULTS: The prevalence of WaSt was 2.4%. Higher odds for WaSt were seen in the following: * Boys: 2.15 times (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.72-2.68); * Children ages 12 to 23 mo 3.15 times (95% CI, 2.33-4.25); * Those with low birth weight 3.11 times (95% CI, 2.33-4.15) * Those with small birth size: 2 times (95% CI, 1.59-2.54) * Babies born from mothers >35 y of age: 1.5 times (95% CI, 1.19-1.89); * Children who experienced infection: 1.43 times (95% CI, 1.16-1.76); * Children not using the Integrated Health and Nutrition Services (Posyandu): 1.17 times (95% CI; 1.29-2.27); * Children from middle- income families:2.54 times higher odds (95% CI, 1.75-3.7); and * Children from rural areas: 1.37 times (95% CI, 1.1-1.71). CONCLUSION: WaSt is associated with multiple factors in Indonesia. Hence, policymakers need to address this problem comprehensively.","Jokhu LA, Syauqy A",Nutrition,2024 Jun,Stunting AND Indonesia
36014954,"Impact of an Integrative Nutrition Package through Home Visit on Maternal and Children Outcome: Finding from Locus Stunting in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.","Background: Stunting has been a public health problem in several developing countries including Indonesia. One of the strategies to reduce stunting was family assistance. This study was aimed to estimate the effect of family assistance by using an integrative nutrition package through home visits on the growth and development of stunted children. Method: This was an experimental study using pre-test post-test with control group design, conducted in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, on March to May 2022. The intervention group was provided an integrative nutrition package (INP) including maternal education, behavioral change through home visit, as well as monitoring children's outcome, while the control group was asked to read and follow child care procedure in the maternal and child health (MCH) book as a standard procedure. Both groups were visited by trained health volunteers and had a complementary feeding (CF) package weekly for four weeks. The outcomes of this study were the maternal outcome (knowledge and behavior on children's growth monitoring (CGM), children's development monitoring (CDM), and infant/young children feeding (IYCF) as well as children's outcomes, including body weight (BW), body height (BH), and child score development (CSD). This study used generalized estimating equation (GEE) to estimate the differences in differences (DID) of the impact of intervention compared with control group and compared among three different times (baseline, fourth, and eighth week). Results: There were 60 stunted children under five years in this study, i.e., 30 in intervention group and 30 in control group. From the GEE analysis, it was found that the regression adjusted DID showed statistically significant increase of all outcomes including children's development score (CDS). The adjusted DID effect (95% CI) on 8th week for children's weight, height, and development score were 0.31 (0.25-0.37), 0.41 (0.13-0.68), and -0.40 (-0.59-(-0.21)), respectively, among the intervention group. Conclusions: INP through home visit successfully increased maternal and children's outcomes compared witsh standard procedure. The effect of intervention was found to be consistently significant in the fourth and eighth weeks after intervention. We recommend the local government to apply INP through home visit especially in high-prevalence stunting areas.","Siswati T, Iskandar S, Pramestuti N, Raharjo J, Rubaya AK, Wiratama BS",Nutrients,2022 Aug 22,Stunting AND Indonesia
36678259,"Sociodemographic and Healthcare Factors Associated with Stunting in Children Aged 6-59 Months in the Urban Area of Bali Province, Indonesia 2018.","Stunting is a worldwide public health concern, including in Indonesia. Even when living in an urban area with urban characteristics, it is still possible for children to be at risk of stunting. The aim of this study was to determine the sociodemographic and healthcare factors associated with stunting in a province experiencing tourism growth, namely, Bali. Cross-sectional data on Bali Province from the Indonesian Basic Health Research Survey (Riskesdas, 2018) were used as the basis for the research analysis. A total of 846 respondents under five years of age were analyzed, indicating a stunting prevalence of 19.0%. Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated low maternal educational attainment (adjustedOR = 1.92; 95% Confidence Interval = 1.24-2.97), the inadequate consumption of iron tablets during pregnancy (adjustedOR = 1.56; 95% Confidence Interval = 1.08-2.24), and no extended family (adjustedOR = 1.55; 95% Confidence Interval = 1.07-2.26) as being significantly associated with stunting. According to these findings, sociodemographic and healthcare factors are associated with stunting in urban Bali. Improving women's education, ensuring sufficient iron tablets are consumed during pregnancy, and encouraging the involvement of the extended family in childcare are recommended.","Kusumajaya AAN, Mubasyiroh R, Sudikno S, Nainggolan O, Nursanyoto H, Sutiari NK, Adhi KT, Suarjana IM, Januraga PP",Nutrients,2023 Jan 12,Stunting AND Indonesia
37020697,"International standard growth charts overestimate stunting prevalence in Nabire and Jakarta, Indonesia, compared to the Indonesian national growth chart.","Children's height in Indonesia is increasing slowly and unevenly across the country, with urban areas growing faster than rural areas. Thus, international growth charts may be ineffective for monitoring the development of Indonesian children. We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study on 1,829 children aged 6 to 12 in Nabire and 1,283 children in Jakarta. Anthropometric measurements were obtained and plotted on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts and Indonesian National Growth Charts to determine which chart is more suitable for monitoring children's growth in Indonesia. Nabire children were shorter and had lower body mass index (BMI) than Jakarta children, with a mean height difference of 7.03 cm in boys and 6.89 cm in girls (p = 0.001) and a mean BMI difference of 1.66 in boys and 1.39 in girls (p = 0.001). Despite their short stature, more Nabire children had a normal BMI, indicating a healthy nutritional status. Using the Indonesian National Growth Charts, fewer children were classified as stunted or wasted. Most of the short stature observed in Nabire children was not due to stunting; the children showed no signs of malnutrition. The Indonesian National Growth Charts represent the growth of Indonesian children more accurately than the CDC growth charts.","Hasibuan SN, Djer MM, Andarie AA, Pulungan AB",Clin Pediatr Endocrinol,2023,Stunting AND Indonesia
38417921,"Epigenetic studies in children at risk of stunting and their parents in India, Indonesia and Senegal: a UKRI GCRF Action Against Stunting Hub protocol paper.","INTRODUCTION: In 2020, an estimated 150 million children under the age of 5 years were stunted. Stunting results from early-life adversity and it is associated with significant physical and cognitive deficit, lifelong socioeconomic disadvantage and reduced life expectancy. There is a need to understand the causes of stunting and its effects in order to develop strategies to avoid it and to mitigate the consequences once stunting has occurred. Epigenetics is an important mechanism through which early-life factors are thought to influence biological function, with long-term consequences. We describe a series of epigenetic studies designed to understand how early-life adversity results in stunting and to inform the development of practical tools such as predictive markers and therapeutic targets. This work is part of the UKRI GCRF Action Against Stunting Hub. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The project-in India, Indonesia and Senegal-comprises an observational study of mothers, fathers, and offspring (n=500) spanning the first 1000 days of life, and an intervention study in each country. Epigenetic status (DNA methylation) is determined in saliva from babies collected within 1 month of birth and again at 18 months of age, and from mothers and fathers around the time of birth. Epigenome-wide analysis is carried out using the Illumina EPIC array, augmented by high-definition sequencing approaches. Statistical analysis is carried out at the level of candidate genes/regions, higher dimensional epigenetic states and epigenome-wide association. Data analysis focuses on the determinants of stunting, the effectiveness of interventions, population comparisons and the link between epigenetics and other thematic areas, which include anthropometry, microbiome, gut health, parasitology, cognition, nutrition, food hygiene and water sanitation, food systems and the home environment. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the relevant Ethics Committees in Indonesia, India and Senegal, and the UK.

37572547,Association between maternal anemia and stunting in infants and children aged 0-60 months: A systematic literature review.,"OBJECTIVES: Maternal anemia is a worldwide health issue and a common pregnancy complication. It leads to consequences including infant mortality, low birth weight, preterm birth, unrecoverable or partially reversible neurobehavioral and cognitive deficits, and short birth length. However, the relationship between maternal anemia and stunting in children is not well defined. This systematic literature review sought to determine whether maternal anemia was associated with height or length and stunting conditions in infants and children ages 0-60 mo in cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies carried out in several countries. METHODS: A systematic review was performed on articles published from 2014-2021 related to maternal anemia and stunting. The electronic databases used were ScienceDirect, PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, Google Search, and AJOG (American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology). The literature search was performed up to December 7, 2021. RESULTS: Twelve studies were included. Nine studies examined the correlation between maternal anemia and length or weight in children. Seven of the nine studies showed an association between maternal anemia and stunting in children; the others showed an association between maternal anemia and birth length. Three studies found no association between maternal anemia and stunting in children under age 5 y. CONCLUSIONS: The current review emphasizes that stunting in children may be associated with maternal anemia, specifically in developing countries. This implies that it is crucial to prevent anemia in adolescent girls and women before and during pregnancy as a part of programs to eliminate stunting in children.","Nadhiroh SR, Micheala F, Tung SEH, Kustiawan TC",Nutrition,2023 Nov,Stunting AND Indonesia
38417928,"Assessment of the role of gut health in childhood stunting in a multisite, longitudinal study in India, Indonesia and Senegal: a UKRI GCRF Action Against Stunting Hub protocol.","INTRODUCTION: Childhood stunting has a complex aetiology, with poor gut health being an important contributor. This study will assess inter-relationships between maternal and infant gut health indices and infant linear growth. Inter-relationships between gut health indices, systemic inflammation and growth hormones in early childhood will also be assessed. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A longitudinal observational study of cohorts of 600 newborns and their mothers in India, Indonesia and Senegal will be conducted. Women will be recruited during pregnancy and their children followed up to age 24 months. Stool, urine and blood samples will be collected from the women and children for assessments of helminthic and protozoal parasites, bacterial pathogens, faecal microbiota taxa, biomarkers of environmental enteric dysfunction, systemic inflammation and growth hormones. Child anthropometric measurements will be collected at birth and at ages 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months. The gut health indices will be integrated with cohort data from other Action Against Stunting Hub (AASH) workstreams for interdisciplinary analyses of childhood stunting and the development of a new typology of stunting.

Mapping out the links between child stunting and Early Childhood Education and Development is critical to increasing understanding of the causes and effects of childhood stunting, and for programme and policy development. The aim of this study is to investigate and compare the development and educational environments across India, Indonesia and Senegal, and to identify the multifactorial drivers and impacts of childhood stunting to inform a new typology. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This current study is part of an interdisciplinary observational research study, where women are recruited during pregnancy and mother-infant pairs followed prospectively, up to 24 months after birth. Eight measures will be used to profile children's early development and learning environments in two sample cohorts: (A) children aged 12 and 24 months born to the women recruited during pregnancy (ie, 500 pregnant mothers per country) and (B) a preschool case-control cohort of siblings from the main cohort aged between 3:6 and 5:6 years of age where anthropomorphic measures will be collected to assess degrees of stunting. Profiling of the development and learning environments in the countries will include both parent/caregiver self-reported and local staff (enumerators) direct assessments of children and settings.

38589810,Creating culturally-informed protocols for a stunting intervention using a situated values-based approach (WeValue InSitu): a double case study in Indonesia and Senegal.,"International development work involves external partners bringing expertise, resources, and management for local interventions in LMICs, but there is often a gap in understandings of relevant local shared values. There is a widespread need to better design interventions which accommodate relevant elements of local culture, as emphasised by recent discussions in global health research regarding neo-colonialism. One recent innovation is the concept of producing 'cultural protocols' to precede and guide community engagement or intervention design, but without suggestions for generating them. This study explores and demonstrates the potential of an approach taken from another field, named WeValue InSitu, to generate local culturally-informed protocols. WeValue InSitu engages stakeholder groups in meaning-making processes which 'crystallize' their envelope of local shared values, making them communicable to outsiders.Our research context is understanding and reducing child stunting, including developing interventions, carried out at the Senegal and Indonesia sites of the UKRI GCRF Action Against Stunting Hub. Each national research team involves eight health disciplines from micro-nutrition to epigenetics, and extensive collection of samples and questionnaires. Local culturally-informed protocols would be generally valuable to pre-inform engagement and intervention designs. Here we explore generating them by immediately following the group WeValue InSitu crystallization process with specialised focus group discussions exploring: what local life practices potentially have significant influence on the environments affecting child stunting, and which cultural elements do they highlight as relevant. The discussions will be framed by the shared values, and reveal linkages to them. In this study, stakeholder groups like fathers, mothers, teachers, market traders, administrators, farmers and health workers were recruited, totalling 83 participants across 20 groups. Themes found relevant for a culturally-informed protocol for locally-acceptable food interventions included: specific gender roles; social hierarchies; health service access challenges; traditional beliefs around malnutrition; and attitudes to accepting outside help. The concept of a grounded culturally-informed protocol, and the use of WeValue InSitu to generate it, has thus been demonstrated here. Future work to scope out the advantages and limitations compared to deductive culture studies, and to using other formative research methods would now be useful.","Chapman AJ, Ebido CC, Tening RN, Huang Y, Sougou NM, Kolopaking R, Diallo AH, Anggorowati R, Dial FB, Massonnie J, Firoozmand M, Niang CEHA, Harder MK",BMC Public Health,2024 Apr 9,Stunting AND Indonesia

Nutrition interventions alone have not produced expected impacts in reducing/preventing child stunting, indicating the importance of understanding the complex interplay between environmental, physiological and psychological factors influencing child nutritional status. This study will investigate maternal and child nutrition, health and well-being status and associated factors through the assessment of: (1) anthropometry, (2) biomarkers of nutrition and health status, (3) dietary intakes, (4) fetal growth and development, (5) infant morbidity, (6) infant and young child feeding (IYCF) and (7) perinatal maternal stress, depression and social support. METHODS: This study will be conducted in a prospective pregnancy cohort in India, Indonesia and Senegal. Pregnant women will be recruited in the second (Indonesia, Senegal) and third (India) trimester of pregnancy, and the mother and infant dyads followed until the infant is 24 months of age. During pregnancy, anthropometric measures will be taken, venous blood samples will be collected for biochemical assessment of nutrition and health status, dietary intakes will be assessed using a 4-pass-24-hour dietary recall method (MP24HR), fetal ultrasound for assessment of fetal growth. After birth, anthropometry measurements will be taken, venous blood samples will be collected, MP24HR will be conducted, infant morbidity and IYCF practices will be assessed and a sample of breastmilk will be collected for nutrient composition analyses.

Or please consider making the following changes in the statement: ""...stunting is estimated to be 2.4 times higher than the normal trend."" which can increase mortality, morbidity, and cause economic losses in the future. This study aims to identify the risk factors for stunting during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An unmatched case-control study was conducted to compare the exposure of stunted (cases) and non-stunted (controls) children. There were 127 children aged 6-24 months, 43 cases, and 84 controls. RESULTS: The probability of stunting was two times greater in children who experienced good changes in the consumption of tofu/tempeh (p: 0.047; AdjustedOR (aOR): 2.296; 95% CI 1.013-5.205) and fourtimes greater in children who have a mother that did not receive iron supplementation during pregnancy (p: 0.030; aOR: 4.344; 95% CI: 1.154-16.355). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the above results, increasing access to nutritious food, and the delivery of services and information related to maternal and child health services during the pandemic needs to be intensified by using innovative low-risk platforms.","Sari K, Sartika RAD",Int J Prev Med,2023,Stunting AND Indonesia
38192646,The interlink between chrono-nutrition and stunting: current insights and future perspectives.,"Stunting is the one factor that is responsible for the irretrievable damage to children's mental and physical health. Stunting imitates chronic undernutrition throughout the most extreme critical stages of growth and development of a child in their early life, and due to that stunted child does not completely develop and are too short for their age. Stunting is mainly linked with brain underdevelopment, along with lifelong damaging consequences, comprising weakened mental and learning capacity, deprived performance in school during childhood, and enhanced risks of nutrition linked to chronic long-lasting ailments, such as diabetes, hypertension, diabesity, and obesity in the future. In this review, the authors mainly summarize the latest studies related to chronic nutrition and how it is related to stunting. Optimal nutrition, particularly during pregnancy and the first 24 months of a child's life, is crucial in preventing stunting. Circadian rhythms play a significant role in maternal and fetal health, affecting outcomes such as premature birth and stunting. Maintaining a balanced diet, avoiding late-night carbohydrate-heavy meals during pregnancy, and promoting breastfeeding align with the body's biological clock, which can benefit newborns in various ways. Providing dedicated spaces for breastfeeding in public places is important to support infant health.","Taslim NA, Farradisya S, Gunawan WB, Alfatihah A, Barus RIB, Ratri LK, Arnamalia A, Barazani H, Samtiya M, Mayulu N, Kim B, Hardinsyah H, Surya E, Nurkolis F",Front Nutr,2023,Stunting AND Indonesia
38191345,"Analysis of traditional feeding practices and stunting among children aged 6 to 59 months in Karanganyar District, Central Java Province, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: Traditional feeding practices are widespread in Indonesia. Therefore, using traditional feeding practices commonly used among mothers, this study examined the association between these practices and stunting along with other relevant factors (i.e., sociodemographic factors, feeding practices, vaccination status, and place of residence). METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Karanganyar District, Central Java Province. Data from a total of 706 children aged 6 to 59 months (352 children with stunting and 354 children without stunting) were obtained from the medical records of 10 primary health care units (PHCUs) in 9 subdistricts. Descriptive analysis and binary logistic regression (BLR) were performed to explore the association between the dependent (stunting) and independent variables. RESULTS: The BLR results from children 6 to 59 months indicated that children of mothers with food restrictions during pregnancy (AOR = 5.87, 95% CI: 3.03, 11.38), children with prelacteal feeding (AOR = 4.27, 95% CI: 2.16, 8.41) and children with food restrictions (AOR = 7.74, 95% CI: 1.22, 49.16) were more likely to experience stunting. Those from children 6 to 23 months revealed that food restrictions during pregnancy (AOR = 17.55, 95% CI: 2.86, 107.80) and prelacteal feeding (AOR = 10.58, 95% CI: 2.06, 54.41) were related to stunting. The reasons for traditional feeding practices were related to cultural beliefs. For example, mothers believed that red meat could cause high blood pressure; thus, the consumption of red meat could trigger miscarriage or bleeding during delivery. In addition, this study showed that low sociodemographic status, inappropriate feeding practices, incomplete vaccination, and residence in rural areas were related to stunting. CONCLUSIONS: The findings reflect the importance of education for mothers to correct misconceptions of traditional feeding practices. The government should strengthen counseling services in PHCUs to improve mothers' knowledge of and attitudes toward appropriate feeding practices. Additionally, public relations practices through the mass media should continue for family members, especially senior members, as they influence mothers' autonomy in decision-making regarding feeding practices in Indonesia.","Astuti Y, Paek SC, Meemon N, Marohabutr T",BMC Pediatr,2024 Jan 8,Stunting AND Indonesia
36554378,"Drivers of Stunting Reduction in Yogyakarta, Indonesia: A Case Study.","BACKGROUND: Chronic malnutrition in children is a severe global health concern. In Yogyakarta, the number of children who are too short for their age has dropped dramatically over the past few decades. OBJECTIVE: To perform an analysis of trends, policies, and programs; and an assessment of government, community, household, and individual drivers of the stunting reduction in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. METHOD: Using a mixed-methods approach, there were three types of research: (1) analysis of quantitative data, (2) evaluation of stunting policy, and (3) focus group discussions and in-depth interviews to collect qualitative data. RESULTS: The prevalence of stunting has decreased from year to year. Mean height-for-age z-scores (HAZ) improved by 0.22 SDs from 2013 to 2021. Male and female toddlers aged <20 months have relatively the same body length as the WHO median, but it is lower for children >20 months old. The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to an increase in stunting-concurrent wasting. Nutrition-specific and -sensitive interventions have been carried out with coverage that continues to increase from year to year, although in 2020, or at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the coverage of specific interventions decreased. The government has committed to tackling stunting by implementing the five pillars of stunting prevention and the eight convergent stunting actions. As the drivers of stunting reduction, national and community stakeholders and mothers, at the village level, cited a combination of poverty reduction, years of formal education, prevention of early marriage, access to food, enhanced knowledge and perception, and increased access to sanitation and hygiene. CONCLUSIONS: Nutrition-specific and -sensitive sector improvements have been crucial for decreasing stunting in Yogyakarta, particularly in the areas of poverty reduction, food access, preventing child marriage, sanitation, education, and increasing knowledge and perception.","Siswati T, Iskandar S, Pramestuti N, Raharjo J, Rubaya AK, Wiratama BS",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2022 Dec 8,Stunting AND Indonesia

The informants interviewed in this study were 60 people recruited using the purposive sampling method also involving Focus Group Discussions (FGD). The results of this study identify that the success of stunting reduction efforts depends on effective collaboration between various stakeholders. The study highlights that social capital, which consists of social networks, collective norms, and trusts, plays an important role in strengthening stunting reduction efforts. Further research is needed to explore the specific impacts of social capital in other contexts in Indonesia and to develop more adaptive intervention models to local social and cultural dynamics.","Astuti SJW, Suindyah Dwiningwarni S, Atmojo S",Dialogues Health,2025 Jun,Stunting AND Indonesia
27167973,"Stunting, Underweight and Overweight in Children Aged 2.0-4.9 Years in Indonesia: Prevalence Trends and Associated Risk Factors.","OBJECTIVE: The double burden of malnutrition affects many low and middle-income countries. This study aimed to: a) determine temporal trends in the prevalence of underweight, stunting, and at risk of overweight/ overweight or obesity in Indonesian children aged 2.0-4.9 years; and b) examine associated risk factors. DESIGN: A repeated cross-sectional survey. This is a secondary data analysis of waves 1, 2, 3, and 4 (1993, 1997, 2000, and 2007) of the Indonesian Family Life Survey, which includes 13 out of 27 provinces in Indonesia. Height, weight and BMI were expressed as z-scores (2006 WHO Child Growth Standards). Weight-for-age-z-score <-2 was categorised as underweight, height-for-age-z-score <-2 as stunted, and BMI-z-score >+1, >+2, >+3 as at-risk, overweight and obese, respectively. RESULTS: There are 938, 913, 939, and 1311 separate children in the 4 waves, respectively. The prevalence of stunting decreased significantly from waves 1 to 4 (from 50.8% to 36.7%), as did the prevalence of underweight (from 34.5% to 21.4%). The prevalence of 'at-risk'/overweight/obesity increased from 10.3% to 16.5% (all P<0.01). Stunting and underweight were related to lower birth weight, being breastfed for 6 months or more, having parents who were underweight or had short stature, and mothers who never attended formal education. Stunting was also higher in rural areas. Being at-risk, or overweight/obese were closely related to being in the youngest age group (2-2.9 years) or male, having parents who were overweight/obese or having fathers with university education. CONCLUSIONS: The double burden of malnutrition occurs in Indonesian children. Development of policy to combine the management of chronic under-nutrition and over-nutrition is required.","Rachmi CN, Agho KE, Li M, Baur LA",PLoS One,2016,Stunting AND Indonesia

Five articles discussed the features of ECC in stunted children, and the other five discussed stunting in children with caries in their primary teeth. CONCLUSION: Several studies found associations between severe ECC and stunting, with ECC and stunting as both independent and dependent variables, suggesting a bi-directional relationship, also supported by literature on the physiological relationship between oral health and nutrition.","Aulia RN, Indriyanti R, Setiawan AS",Front Public Health,2023,Stunting AND Indonesia
36732463,Child Stunting Reduction in Aceh Province: Challenges and a Way Ahead.,"INTRODUCTION: Indonesia ranks the fifth highest in child stunting among Asian countries. Aceh, a westernmost province in Indonesia recorded the highest prevalence of stunting in children under two years old in the nation. Our study investigated the current government efforts on child stunting reduction activities since the introduction of Governor Regulation No. 14/2019. METHODS: The study investigated the current efforts of Aceh governments and relevant actors on child stunting reduction using in-depth interviews, document reviews and focus group discussions. RESULTS: Thirty-five (35) respondents including policy makers were interviewed, four focus group discussions (15 each group) were conducted, and various official documents were reviewed. Various challenges for reducing child stunting in Aceh were identified: inadequate knowledge and skills of Posyandu cadres on child stunting; reluctance to consume iron and folic acid (IFA), and supplementary foods (PMT Bumil) by many pregnant women due to perceived annoying effects and unappetizing taste; work engagement, insufficient breast milk production and inadequate support from husbands failing to achieve exclusive breastfeeding among nursing women; inadequate provision of complementary fortified foods for children 6-23 months; lack of clean water, waste management and WASH practices. CONCLUSION: The intervention on both nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive factors was found to be insufficient in Aceh. Although WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) practices are the most important contributors to child stunting, only the health agency plays a singular role in reduction efforts by focussing on specific factors. Coordination between relevant agencies to address both factors is required to achieve the effectiveness of child stunting reduction and prevention in Aceh.","Sufri S, Nurhasanah, Jannah M, Dewi TP, Sirasa F, Bakri S",Matern Child Health J,2023 May,Stunting AND Indonesia
37159976,"Water, sanitation, and hygiene vulnerability in child stunting in developing countries: a systematic review with meta-analysis.","OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the scientific evidence of the relationship between vulnerability to access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) practices on stunting in children aged <5 years in developing countries. STUDY DESIGN: This is a systematic review and meta-analysis article to assess the relationship between under-five stunting and WASH vulnerability in developing countries. METHODS: The systematic review with meta-analysis was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol methodology. The following databases were used: LILACS, MEDLINE (via PubMed), SciELO, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, SCOPUS, and Embase. All original studies identified that related WASH vulnerability to stunting in children aged <5 years in developing countries was included. Three authors performed independently the selection and extraction of data from the articles. The statistical software STATA version 11 was used. Cochran's Q test and Chi-square test (I(2)) with 95% significance were used to assess the heterogeneity of the studies. RESULTS: The search resulted in the initial identification of 2047 articles; after reading the abstracts, followed by the full articles, 14 articles were included in the systematic review and eight articles were included in the meta-analysis. The studies selected for the systematic review were published between the years 1992 and 2021 and conducted in eight countries, namely, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Tanzania, Peru, China, and Lesotho. The studies assessed vulnerability to access to WASH on the growth of children aged <5 years. There was a significant difference when relating WASH vulnerability to children's height. The meta-analysis of this study showed that the impact of WASH on child stunting is significant when it comes to lack of sanitation in 72% of the studies. CONCLUSIONS: The study found that WASH vulnerability contributes to stunting in children aged <5 years in developing countries. Based on our findings, we recommend incorporating WASH strategies, especially sanitation, into the formulation of interventions integrating with health promotion policies for healthy early childhood development.","Mudadu Silva JR, Vieira LL, Murta Abreu AR, de Souza Fernandes E, Moreira TR, Dias da Costa G, Mitre Cotta RM",Public Health,2023 Jun,Stunting AND Indonesia
40362802,"Understanding Stunting: Impact, Causes, and Strategy to Accelerate Stunting Reduction-A Narrative Review.","Stunting is a major global health concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, due to its persistently high prevalence. It often originates from chronic malnutrition during the critical first 1000 days of life. Maternal and child nutrition are critical determinants of a child's growth and development. This article aimed to explore the impact, causes, and evidence-based strategies to accelerate the reduction of stunting incidence worldwide. This review was undertaken with sources from PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and MEDLINE from October 2024 to January 2025. This review was undertaken with sources from PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and MEDLINE from October 2024 to January 2025 using the keyword ""Stunting"", ""Causes of stunting"", ""Stunting Impact"", ""Stunting Intervention"", and ""Stunting Prevention"". The findings highlight the multifactorial causes of stunting, including maternal malnutrition, inadequate breastfeeding and complementary feeding, poor sanitation, and socioeconomic factors. Stunting is associated with impaired linear growth, cognitive deficits, gut dysbiosis, endocrine disruption, anemia, and increased risk of chronic diseases later in life. Addressing stunting demands multisectoral strategies focusing on maternal and child nutrition, infection prevention, improved WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene) practices, and socioeconomic support. The evidence presented may guide policy development and targeted interventions to prevent stunting and its long-term effects.","Mulyani AT, Khairinisa MA, Khatib A, Chaerunisaa AY",Nutrients,2025 Apr 29,Stunting AND Indonesia

It also examined the perceptions of parenting styles shaped by socio-cultural contexts and time constraints affecting the nutritional status as well as growth in Bejiharjo Village, Java, Indonesia. METHODS: A qualitative method was used and data were collected through in-depth interviews, diary recording, and focus group discussions with mothers of toddlers, stakeholders, and healthcare professionals. Transcript data from recorded interviews were processed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: The results showed that there were four emergent themes, namely ""Toddler parenting patterns,"" ""Family and environmental health,"" ""Eating patterns and consumption habits of toddlers,"" as well as ""Literacy and understanding of parenting and child health."" Furthermore, eight related theme clusters were yielded from the analysis of parenting experiences. Differences between stunted and non-stunted toddlers in parenting patterns and daily activities were recorded. Interactions between toddlers and mothers as well as productive activities had a shorter average duration. CONCLUSION: Mothers experience various challenges and limitations in raising toddlers with the risk of stunting. Therefore, increasing understanding and knowledge about the importance of healthy parenting and good nutrition are necessary to prevent stunting.","Azzahra I, Listyaningsih U, Mulyani RRWP",Child Health Nurs Res,2024 Oct,Stunting AND Indonesia

39337997,Addressing Health Illiteracy and Stunting in Culture-Shocked Indigenous Populations: A Case Study of Outer Baduy in Indonesia.,"This research aims to determine the factors, impacts, and solutions for health literacy in the Outer Baduy hamlets of Kanekes Village, Indonesia. The method used in this research is qualitative, which produces an in-depth explanation of the existing problems. Data were collected through interviews and documentation. Interviews were conducted with key figures, including two female Baduy residents with stunted children, one retainer, the head of the NGO SRI, a midwife who works in the Baduy village, and the head of the Lebak social service. Apart from that, secondary data in the form of recordings of community service talk shows conducted by the University of Indonesia to overcome stunting in Baduy were also analysed. The results show that the factors associated with the low health literacy of the Baduy community are literacy, writing and reading, taboos on eating certain foods, people spending too much time in the fields, people learning by imitating their parents, demanding access to villages, lack of consistency from external parties in providing health programs, and gender segregation in Baduy society. The impact of the low health literacy of the Baduy community is fatalism, high maternal and child mortality rates, and high health costs. The proposed strategies for increasing the health literacy of the Baduy community based on the findings of this research include developing health literacy by targeting community leaders, managing information-technology-based health-information groups, and always presenting at least one health worker among the residents who provides an example of healthy living, encouraging collective reflection. when health cases occur, and balancing gender communication.","Putri LD, Agustin H, Bakti I, Suminar JR",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2024 Aug 23,Stunting AND Indonesia
33855394,"Low intake of essential amino acids and other risk factors of stunting among under-five children in Malang City, East Java, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: The lack of energy-protein intake has been shown to increase the risk of stunting in under-five children. The quality of protein in food is assessed by the completeness of amino acid content. This study aims to determine the amount of essential amino acid (EAAs) intake and other risk factors of stunting among under-five children. DESIGN AND METHODS: A descriptive, case-control study was performed in the work area of Kedungkandang Health Center Malang. The subjects were 24-59 month-old children with a total of 23 stunted (height-for-age Z-score (HAZ) <-2 SD) and 57 normal children (HAZ >/=-2 SD). Furthermore, the data were collected using anthropometric measurement, validated and pre-tested questionnaires, which were analyzed using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: The intake of all the nine EAAs in stunted children was lower than that of non-stunted children. However, only histidine, isoleucine, and methionine were significantly different (p<0.05). The significant risk factors of stunting include a family income per month fewer than the Regional Minimum Wages [OR=12.06, 95% CI 1.83-79.53], being underweight [OR=7.11, 95% CI 1.49-33.93], breastfeeding of less than 6 months [OR=5.34, 95% CI 1.28-22.20], and the lack of EAA methionine intake [OR=0.14, 95% CI 0.03-0.67]. CONCLUSIONS: Stunted children may not receive sufficient dietary intake of EAAs in their diet. Furthermore, the lack of EAAs intake, especially methionine, alongside low family income, underweight, lack of breastfeeding and variety in food consumption were the risk factors of stunting among under-five children in a selected Health Center in Malang City, Indonesia.","Rizky Maulidiana A, Sutjiati E",J Public Health Res,2021 Apr 14,Stunting AND Indonesia

35769448,"Complementary Feeding Practices among Young Children in China, India, and Indonesia: A Narrative Review.","Under- and overnutrition are co-existing health issues in several countries across Asia. Poor complementary feeding (CF) is a significant determinant of malnutrition in children and a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this narrative review is to summarize the most recent evidence regarding the CF practices in 3 countries with a high prevalence of stunting and overweight, and currently undergoing rapid economic and nutritional transition: China, India, and Indonesia. We focused particularly on the adequacy of CF, based on the WHO feeding indicators (2021) regarding timing, frequency, diversity, as well as the consumption of specific food groups. According to the findings, the majority of infants in the 3 countries are introduced to CF at an inappropriate time: either too early (particularly in urban/rural areas of China and Indonesia) or too late (India) compared with the WHO recommendation. Furthermore, in all countries, diets are characterized by a low variety and frequency of CF and consist mainly of staple foods with poor nutritional quality, such as rice, cereals, or noodles. Nutrient-dense and protein-rich foods, such as foods of animal origin, are either inadequately consumed (rural areas of China and India) or introduced too late (urban areas of China and Indonesia) in the diets of children. In all countries, the consumption of fruit and vegetables, especially during the early CF period, is poor. In contrast, a significant proportion of both urban and rural children, particularly in Indonesia and India, are consuming energy-dense/nutrient-poor snacks and sugary drinks during the CF period. The described practices may pose a significant risk for the development of energy and/or nutrient gaps, magnifying the double and triple burden of malnutrition present in these countries. Further research is warranted to understand the significance of the observed practices for stunting and/or overweight/obesity risk.","Sirkka O, Abrahamse-Berkeveld M, van der Beek EM",Curr Dev Nutr,2022 Jun,Stunting AND Indonesia
19818167,Prevalence and risk factors for stunting and severe stunting among under-fives in North Maluku province of Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Adequate nutrition is needed to ensure optimum growth and development of infants and young children. Understanding of the risk factors for stunting and severe stunting among children aged less than five years in North Maluku province is important to guide Indonesian government public health planners to develop nutrition programs and interventions in a post conflict area. The purpose of the current study was to assess the prevalence of and the risk factors associated with stunting and severe stunting among children aged less than five years in North Maluku province of Indonesia. METHODS: The health and nutritional status of children aged less than five years was assessed in North Maluku province of Indonesia in 2004 using a cross-sectional multi-stage survey conducted on 750 households from each of the four island groups in North Maluku province. A total of 2168 children aged 0-59 months were used in the analysis. RESULTS: Prevalence of stunting and severe stunting were 29% (95%CI: 26.0-32.2) and 14.1% (95%CI: 11.7-17.0) for children aged 0-23 months and 38.4% (95%CI: 35.9-41.0) and 18.4% (95%CI: 16.1-20.9) for children aged 0-59 months, respectively. After controlling for potential confounders, multivariate analysis revealed that the risk factors for stunted children were child's age in months, male sex and number of family meals per day (<or=2 times), for children aged 0-23 months, and income (poorest and middle-class family), child's age in months and male sex for children aged 0-59 months. The risk factors for severe stunting in children aged 0-23 months were income (poorest family), male sex and child's age in months and for children aged 0-59 months were income (poorest family), father's occupation (not working), male sex and child's age in months. CONCLUSION: Programmes aimed at improving stunting in North Maluku province of Indonesia should focus on children under two years of age, of male sex and from families of low socioeconomic status.","Ramli, Agho KE, Inder KJ, Bowe SJ, Jacobs J, Dibley MJ",BMC Pediatr,2009 Oct 6,Stunting AND Indonesia
35215492,Geographic and Socioeconomic Disparity in Child Undernutrition across 514 Districts in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Globally, in 2020, 45 million children were estimated to be wasted, and 149 million children under five years of age were estimated to be stunted. Undernutrition makes children in particular much more vulnerable to disease and death. Our study aims to examine geographic and socioeconomic disparities in child undernutrition across 514 districts in Indonesia. METHODS: Employing both geospatial and quantitative analyses (descriptive statistics and Ordinary Least Squares regressions), we analyzed the disparities in the prevalence of underweight, severe underweight, wasting, severe wasting, stunting, and severe stunting among districts. Child undernutrition data were from Indonesia Basic Health Survey (Riskesdas) 2018, which included a sample of 93,620 children under five years. Socioeconomic data were from the World Bank. RESULTS: We found a relatively large geographic and socioeconomic disparity in child undernutrition in Indonesia. By region, districts in the Papua region (including Maluku and Nusa Tenggara) had a significantly higher prevalence of underweight and wasting than those in the Java region (including Bali). Districts in Papua had 44%, 121%, 38%, and 57% higher prevalence of underweight, severe underweight, wasting, and severe wasting, respectively. Similarly, the poorest districts had a significantly higher prevalence of underweight, wasting, and stunting than the wealthiest districts. The poorest districts had 30%, 83%, 16%, 21%, and 74% higher prevalence of underweight, severe underweight, wasting, stunting, and severe stunting, respectively. These results were similar among rural districts. CONCLUSION: There is a significant disparity in child undernutrition across districts in Indonesia. The government needs to prioritize the reduction of child undernutrition, especially in rural areas, districts outside of Java and Bali, and the poorest and least educated areas.","Ayuningtyas D, Hapsari D, Rachmalina R, Amir V, Rachmawati R, Kusuma D",Nutrients,2022 Feb 17,Stunting AND Indonesia
38777845,"Monitoring and evaluation of childhood stunting reduction program based on fish supplement product in North Sumatera, Indonesia.","The government of Serdang Bedagai Regency initiated a supplementation program to reduce the high prevalence of stunting in the area by delivering extra supplementation, which were nutritious biscuits from national government and fish-based supplement produced from local resources. A 6-month study from April 2022 to September 2022 was conducted to monitor and evaluate the government program that involved 219 under-5-year-old children with height-for-age Z-score (HAZ-score) below - 2. We observed the stunting prevalence reduction by 37.00%, where 81 children recovered from stunting (HAZ-score >/= - 2). Furthermore, the mean HAZ-score and WHZ-score (Weight-for-Height Z-score) were monitored to significantly improve by 0.97 +/- 1.45 (P-value = 1.74e(-14)) and 1.00 +/- 2.18 (P-value  = and 2.40e(-8)), subsequently. The most significant improvement in HAZ-score was monitored among children receiving fish-based supplements with 1.04 +/- 1.44 improvement (P-value = 6.59e(-17)).

39700198,Problem nutrients in diet of under-five children and district food security status: Linear programming analyses of 37 stunting priority districts in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: In Indonesia, food security and dietary patterns varied by regions. This might lead to differences in problem nutrients (PN) and should be considered in developing local-specific food-based recommendations (FBRs) for stunting prevention. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to identify PNs in diet of under-five children in selected 37 stunting priority districts in Indonesia and assess whether the number of PNs was associated with district food security status. METHODS: Linear programming analysis (LP) using Optifood was done using single 24-hour dietary recall data Ministry of Health 2016 Food Consumption Survey. PN was defined as nutrient which did not meet 100% Recommended Nutrient Intake (RNI) based on Indonesian-RNI in the 2-best-diets scenario. District's food security status was determined using Food Security Vulnerability Atlas 2018. RESULTS: The top three PNs amongst under-five childrenwere iron, folate, vitamin B12 (6-11mo); folate, calcium, zinc (12-23mo); folate, calcium, vitamin C (24-35mo); and calcium, folate, vitamin C (36-59mo). There were no significant differences in number of PNs based on food security status. After integrating the nutrient-dense foods into FBRs, the number of districts with dietary inadequacy decreased for the top-3 problem nutrients in each age group, with the exception of iron for infants. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that problem nutrients and dietary inadequacy were prevalent in diet of under-five children, even in food-secure areas. Promoting locally available nutrient-dense foods through FBRs (nutrition-specific intervention) and ensuring availability and access to these foods (nutrition-sensitive intervention) are recommended. Additional intervention(s), particularly for iron in infants, are required.","Fahmida U, Pramesthi IL, Kusuma S, Sudibya ARP, Rahmawati R, Suciyanti D, Gusnedi G, Diana A",PLoS One,2024,Stunting AND Indonesia
39901750,Association Between Basic Immunization Status and Stunting in Toddlers Aged 12 to 59 Months in Indonesia.,"OBJECTIVE: Immunization has been identified as a specific nutrition-related intervention to address the direct causes of stunting. This study examines the association between basic immunization status and stunting among toddlers in Indonesia. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data from the 2021 Study of Indonesia's Nutritional Status. A total of 70,267 toddlers, aged 12 to 59 months, were examined. Cox regression was employed to calculate prevalence ratios (PRs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: The prevalence of stunting among children aged 12 to 59 months in Indonesia was 23.1%, while 74.92% of children under 5 years old had complete basic immunization status. Multivariable analysis revealed a statistically significant association between basic immunization status and the incidence of stunting. Relative to toddlers with complete basic immunization, those with incomplete (partial) immunization were at a 1.18 times higher risk of stunting (adjusted PR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.22). Furthermore, toddlers who had not been immunized at all faced an even greater stunting risk (adjusted PR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.37). This association persisted after adjusting for variables such as maternal education, economic status, and the child's birth weight. CONCLUSIONS: Basic immunization status influences the incidence of stunting in toddlers aged 12 to 59 months. Thus, parents must ensure that their children's immunizations are completed according to the recommended schedule. Additionally, it is crucial to increase parental awareness regarding health service utilization, disease prevention, and the nutritional needs of toddlers.","Purwanti E, Masitoh S, Ronoatmodjo S",J Prev Med Public Health,2025 Jan 30,Stunting AND Indonesia

29950536,Obesity as the Sequel of Childhood Stunting: Ghrelin and GHSR Gene Polymorphism Explained.,"Stunting or short stature in children is a significant nutritional problem in developing and underdeveloped countries. Stunting during childhood might affect brain development and impair development cognitive function. Additionally, this condition associated with the increased risk for obesity during adulthood. Several studies have shown that the increment risk of obesity and overweight in children with a short stature was due to their metabolic efficiency. Children with stunting have lower resting energy expenditure compared to non stunting children. Additionally, stunted children has higher respiratory quotient and carbohydrate oxidation but lower fat oxidation compared to non-stunting children. These results might explain why stunted children easily become obese, which is due to lower fat oxidation and leading to tendency to store fat.This review discussed the current status on studies in the nutrigenetic aspects of the relationship between stunting in the childhood and obesity in adulthood. I hypothesized that stunted children are more likely to become obese in their later life because they have lower metabolic rate and higher tendency of fat storage. There are several candidate genes and pathway involved in obesity and I suspected that ghrelin and its receptor growth hormone secretague receptor (GHSR) were responsible.",Muhammad HFL,Acta Med Indones,2018 Apr,Stunting AND Indonesia
33957035,Effect of maternal and child factors on stunting: partial least squares structural equation modeling.,"BACKGROUND: Stunting is affected by various factors from mother and child. Previous studies assessed only one or more influencing variables. Unfortunately, nor the significant influence of maternal and child factors nor the indicators contributing to maternal and child factors that affect the stunting incidence have ever been analyzed. PURPOSE: This study analyzed the effect of maternal and child factors on stunting and the significant indicators that shape the maternal and child factors that impact stunting. METHODS: This was a case-control study. Overall, 132 stunted children and 132 nonstunted children in Purbalingga Regency, Central Java Province, participated in the research. Direct interviews and medical record reviews were conducted to assess the studied variables. The research data were tested using the partial least squares structural equation with a formative model. RESULTS: Maternal factors directly affected the occurrence of stunting (t=3.527, P<0.001) with an effect of 30.3%. Maternal factors also contributed a significant indirect effect on stunting through child factors (t=4.762, P<0.001) with an effect of 28.2%. Child factors affected the occurrence of stunting (t= 5.749, P<0.001) with an effect of 49.8%. The child factor was influenced by maternal factor with an effect of 56.7% (t=10.014, P<0.001). The moderation analysis results demonstrated that maternal and child factors were moderate predictive variables of stunting occurrence. CONCLUSION: Child factors have more significant and direct effects on stunting than maternal factors but are greatly affected by them.","Santosa A, Novanda Arif E, Abdul Ghoni D",Clin Exp Pediatr,2022 Feb,Stunting AND Indonesia
37000777,Factors driving and inhibiting stunting reduction acceleration programs at district level: A qualitative study in West Sumatra.,"Stunting prevalence varies significantly across Indonesian provinces and districts/municipalities, including West Sumatra. This research aims to identify the driving and inhibiting factors for implementing the stunting reduction acceleration program at the district level in West Sumatra. The research was conducted in 2022 with a qualitative study design and a case study approach. Data were collected through (i) group interviews with key informants involving policymakers and program managers at the provincial, district, sub-district, and village levels and (ii) in-depth interviews with mothers of stunted children. Two districts were selected as research sites. One district represents an area that has yet to be developed (District A or failed district). The other district has seen a significant reduction in the prevalence of stunting (District B or successful district). We found several driving and inhibiting factors that affect the reduced prevalence of stunting, such as the need for the relevant agency to play a strong role as the leading and responsible sector for stunting convergence actions. Another important factor is paying close attention to improving the quality of stunting data and providing adequate funding support. High commitment from Public Health Centers to maternal health through classes for pregnant women, infants, and children under the age of five can also have an impact. Furthermore, properly performing duties by assigned actors in specific and sensitive programs and integrated monitoring and evaluation of program implementation and outcomes can influence stunting prevalence. Recommendations for accelerating stunting reduction include improving communication and coordination, establishing stunting prevalence reduction as a performance indicator among the related district government and its various agencies, and assisting the village administration with planning and budgeting to support stunting prevention.","Syafrawati S, Lipoeto NI, Masrul M, Novianti N, Gusnedi G, Susilowati A, Nurdin A, Purnakarya I, Andrafikar A, Umar HB",PLoS One,2023,Stunting AND Indonesia

Since 2019, stunting has become a national priority due to suspected factors such as low nutrition intake, especially from animal protein sources, high rates of worm infections, and low compliance of under-fives in consuming deworming drugs. Therefore, this research aimed to analyze the relationship between deworming consumption, adequacy of animal protein intake, and stunting incidence in children aged 12-59 months in Bandar Lampung in 2022. This research used an analytic survey with a cross-sectional approach to analyze the relationship between deworming consumption, adequacy of animal protein intake, and stunting in under-fives at two priority stunting handling neighbourhoods in Bandar Lampung, namely Way Gubak and Karang Maritim. The sample consisted of 262 under fives and their mothers who visited the integrated health post in the selected neighbourhoods from November to December 2022, and the data obtained were analyzed using logistic regression. The results revealed a relationship between the consumption of an deworming and varying animal protein consumption with stunting incidence. This indicated a need to promote the importance of consuming deworming and adequate consumption of animal protein with variation to prevent stunting in children in Bandar Lampung.","Hermawan D, Kurniasari D, Sandayanti V, Sari N, Listyaningsih E",Parasite Epidemiol Control,2023 Nov,Stunting AND Indonesia

35865865,Comparison of Cognitive Function in Children with Stunting and Children with Undernutrition with Normal Stature.,"BACKGROUND: Stunting is the impaired growth and development that children experience from poor nutrition, repeated infection, and inadequate psychosocial stimulation. Children are defined as stunted if their height-for-age is more than two standard deviations below the WHO Child Growth Standards median. According to the Indonesia Basic National Health Survey 2013, Indonesia's stunting prevalence reached 37.2%. Various studies have shown that impaired cognitive development is found in children with stunting and undernutrition. This study aims to determine cognitive development in stunted and undernutrition with normal stature children using the Bayley Scale of Infant Development III (Bayley-III). METHODS: A cross-sectional study on 51 children aged one month to 3 years who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and who visited the outpatient clinic of Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo National General Hospital from June 2017 to January 2018 was performed. Cognitive development was assessed using the Bayley Scale of Infant Development, Third Edition (Bayley-III). RESULTS: 26 children with stunting and 25 children with undernutrition with normal stature participated in this study. There was a statistically nonsignificant trend toward lower median score percentiles in the stunted group compared to that in the undernourished with normal stature group in the motor (median (range) 1 (0.1-75) vs. 4 (0-79); p=0.183), cognitive (12.5 (0.1-75) vs. 16 (0.1-99.9); p=0.550), and adaptive behavior (7 (0.1-75) vs. 12 (0.1-58); p=0.657) domains. CONCLUSIONS: There is a trend toward lower cognitive, motor, and adaptive behavior abilities in stunted children compared to undernourished children with normal stature which needs further study. In addition, children with undernutrition have below-average abilities across all domains even before stunting has occurred.","Handryastuti S, Pusponegoro HD, Nurdadi S, Chandra A, Pramita FA, Soebadi A, Widjaja IR, Rafli A",J Nutr Metab,2022,Stunting AND Indonesia
34073270,Micronutrient Deficiencies and Stunting Were Associated with Socioeconomic Status in Indonesian Children Aged 6-59 Months.,"Micronutrient deficiencies and stunting are known as a significant problem in most developing countries, including Indonesia. The objective of this study was to analyze the association between micronutrient deficiencies and stunting with socioeconomic status (SES) among Indonesian children aged 6-59 months. This cross-sectional study was part of the South East Asian Nutrition Surveys (SEANUTS). A total of 1008 Indonesian children were included in the study. Anemia, iron deficiency, vitamin A deficiency, vitamin D deficiency, and stunting were identified in this study. Structured questionnaires were used to measure SES. Differences between micronutrient parameters and anthropometric indicators with the SES groups were tested using one-way ANOVA with post-hoc test after adjusted for age, area resident (rural and urban), and sex. The highest prevalence of anemia, stunting, and severe stunting were found to be most significant in the lowest SES group at 45.6%, 29.3%, and 54.5%, respectively. Children from the lowest SES group had significantly lower means of Hb, ferritin, retinol, and HAZ. Severely stunted children had a significantly lower mean of Hb concentration compared to stunted and normal height children. Micronutrient deficiencies, except vitamin D, and stunting, were associated with low SES among Indonesian children aged 6-59 months.","Ernawati F, Syauqy A, Arifin AY, Soekatri MYE, Sandjaja S",Nutrients,2021 May 26,Stunting AND Indonesia
32953641,Risk Factors and Nutritional Profiles Associated with Stunting in Children.,"PURPOSE: To analyze risk factors and various nutrients associated with stunting among children aged 6-60 months. METHODS: This is a case-control and cross-sectional study between 40 stunting cases and 40 controls. Data on possible risk factors associated with stunting were obtained through direct interviews and using a questionnaire. Examination of vitamin D, zinc, albumin, and ferritin levels was performed on both groups. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 23.0 (IBM Co., Armonk, NY, USA) to determine risk factors for stunting and to assess the relationship between nutritional levels and stunting. RESULTS: The incidence of stunting was highest in children aged 12-36 months. Children with low weight and very low weight for age comprised of 55% and 22.5%, respectively, of the study participants. The highest mother's educational level was junior high school (40%). History of low birth weight (LBW) was more commonly observed in the stunting group than that in the control group (25.0% and 7.5%, respectively; p=0.034, odds ratio, 0.310 [95% confidence interval, 0.122-0.789]). Approximately 7.5% of cases had premature birth. Exclusive breast feeding was found to be not correlated with stunting. The mean zinc level in the stunting group was 34.17 ng/mL, which was different from that in the control group (50.83 ng/mL) (p=0.023). Blood ferritin, vitamin D, albumin, and calcium levels were not strongly correlated with stunting. CONCLUSION: LBW is the main risk factor contributing to stunting and is strongly associated with low zinc level.","Febriani ADB, Daud D, Rauf S, Nawing HD, Ganda IJ, Salekede SB, Angriani H, Maddeppungeng M, Juliaty A, Alasiry E, Artaty RD, Lawang SA, Ridha NR, Laompo A, Rahimi R, Aras J, Sarmila B",Pediatr Gastroenterol Hepatol Nutr,2020 Sep,Stunting AND Indonesia
39457233,Relationship Between Iron Deficiency Anemia and Stunting in Pediatric Populations in Developing Countries: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and stunting are prevalent global health issues, particularly in developing countries, where previous studies have suggested a potential relationship between them. This systematic review aims to analyze the relationship between iron deficiency anemia and stunting in pediatric populations in developing countries. METHODS: Literature searches were conducted on PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and EBSCO Host. The primary outcome was the association between IDA and stunting. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cohort studies and the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) for other observational studies. Meta-analysis was performed with a random-effects model and heterogeneity assessment. A Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) assessment was performed to determine the certainty and importance of the study. RESULTS: Out of 19,095 articles, 15 studies were included in the systematic review, and 4 studies were included in the meta-analysis, encompassing 21,936 subjects aged 0 to 12 years. IDA prevalence ranged from 3.6 to 58.8%, while stunting prevalence varied from 6.6 to 44.5%. Nine articles supported a significant relationship between IDA and stunting, revealing that stunted children had a 1.31-6.785 times higher risk of developing IDA. The odds ratio of children with IDA to be stunted was 2.27 (95% CI = 1.30-3.95). All studies exhibited a moderate risk of bias. GRADE assessment suggested that the evidence's certainty is low but important. CONCLUSIONS: The high IDA prevalence in developing countries, including Indonesia, is associated with stunting in children, suggesting a synergistic relationship.","Oktarina C, Dilantika C, Sitorus NL, Basrowi RW",Children (Basel),2024 Oct 19,Stunting AND Indonesia
39252507,Development and validation of prediction models for fetal growth restriction and birthweight: an individual participant data meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Fetal growth restriction is associated with perinatal morbidity and mortality. Early identification of women having at-risk fetuses can reduce perinatal adverse outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To assess the predictive performance of existing models predicting fetal growth restriction and birthweight, and if needed, to develop and validate new multivariable models using individual participant data. DESIGN: Individual participant data meta-analyses of cohorts in International Prediction of Pregnancy Complications network, decision curve analysis and health economics analysis. PARTICIPANTS: Pregnant women at booking. External validation of existing models (9 cohorts, 441,415 pregnancies); International Prediction of Pregnancy Complications model development and validation (4 cohorts, 237,228 pregnancies). PREDICTORS: Maternal clinical characteristics, biochemical and ultrasound markers. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: fetal growth restriction defined as birthweight <10th centile adjusted for gestational age and with stillbirth, neonatal death or delivery before 32 weeks' gestation birthweight. ANALYSIS: First, we externally validated existing models using individual participant data meta-analysis. If needed, we developed and validated new International Prediction of Pregnancy Complications models using random-intercept regression models with backward elimination for variable selection and undertook internal-external cross-validation. We estimated the study-specific performance (c-statistic, calibration slope, calibration-in-the-large) for each model and pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was quantified using tau(2) and 95% prediction intervals. We assessed the clinical utility of the fetal growth restriction model using decision curve analysis, and health economics analysis based on National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2008 model. RESULTS: Of the 119 published models, one birthweight model (Poon) could be validated. None reported fetal growth restriction using our definition. Across all cohorts, the Poon model had good summary calibration slope of 0.93 (95% confidence interval 0.90 to 0.96) with slight overfitting, and underpredicted birthweight by 90.4 g on average (95% confidence interval 37.9 g to 142.9 g). The newly developed International Prediction of Pregnancy Complications-fetal growth restriction model included maternal age, height, parity, smoking status, ethnicity, and any history of hypertension, pre-eclampsia, previous stillbirth or small for gestational age baby and gestational age at delivery. This allowed predictions conditional on a range of assumed gestational ages at delivery. The pooled apparent c-statistic and calibration were 0.96 (95% confidence interval 0.51 to 1.0), and 0.95 (95% confidence interval 0.67 to 1.23), respectively. The model showed positive net benefit for predicted probability thresholds between 1% and 90%. In addition to the predictors in the International Prediction of Pregnancy Complications-fetal growth restriction model, the International Prediction of Pregnancy Complications-birthweight model included maternal weight, history of diabetes and mode of conception. Average calibration slope across cohorts in the internal-external cross-validation was 1.00 (95% confidence interval 0.78 to 1.23) with no evidence of overfitting. Birthweight was underestimated by 9.7 g on average (95% confidence interval -154.3 g to 173.8 g). LIMITATIONS: We could not externally validate most of the published models due to variations in the definitions of outcomes. Internal-external cross-validation of our International Prediction of Pregnancy Complications-fetal growth restriction model was limited by the paucity of events in the included cohorts. The economic evaluation using the published National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2008 model may not reflect current practice, and full economic evaluation was not possible due to paucity of data. FUTURE WORK: International Prediction of Pregnancy Complications models' performance needs to be assessed in routine practice, and their impact on decision-making and clinical outcomes needs evaluation. CONCLUSION: The International Prediction of Pregnancy Complications-fetal growth restriction and International Prediction of Pregnancy Complications-birthweight models accurately predict fetal growth restriction and birthweight for various assumed gestational ages at delivery. These can be used to stratify the risk status at booking, plan monitoring and management. STUDY REGISTRATION: This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42019135045.

36882796,"Maternal and Child Health handbook and under-6 child overweight in greater Jakarta, Indonesia: a cross-sectional web-based survey.","BACKGROUND: In Indonesia, the double burden of child overnutrition and undernutrition is a public health concern. The nationally distributed Maternal and Child Health (MCH) handbook provides child nutrition information to caregivers. We aimed to find mothers' information sources regarding child nutrition, including the internet and the MCH handbook, and to explore the association between overweight and use of the MCH handbook. METHOD: A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted among mothers with children under 6 years old in Greater Jakarta during 2019. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression examined the association between child nutrition status and use of the MCH handbook. RESULTS: Data were collected from 233 children. Overweight, underweight, wasting, and stunting were identified in 36.4%, 22.6%, 26.8%, and 37.6%, respectively. 62.5% of mothers used the MCH handbook, and 88.2% used the internet via a mobile phone. Significantly more cases of overweight were observed among children whose mothers used the MCH handbook (adjusted OR [aOR]: 5.829; 95% Confidential Interval [CI]: 1.618-20.999) whereas no relationship was observed between MCH handbook use and child undernutrition. Significant associations with child overweight were found for mother's education (tertiary) (aOR: 0.294; 95%CI: 0.098-0.885), employment type (fulltime) (aOR: 0.185; 95%CI: 0.061-0.562), watching television (more than 1 h) (aOR: 4.387; 95%CI: 1.648-11.678) and recognition of child overweight by mother (yes) (aOR: 3.405; 95%CI: 1.05-11.03). CONCLUSION: These results indicate the need to support mothers of children exhibiting overnutrition and undernutrition. The MCH handbook should be modified to address this issue.","Saito A, Kondo M",BMC Nutr,2023 Mar 7,Stunting AND Indonesia
33671696,Effectiveness of Food Fortification in Improving Nutritional Status of Mothers and Children in Indonesia.,"Food fortification programs have been conducted in several countries to overcome micronutrient deficiency and related problems with various degrees of effectiveness. Available information regarding the success of food fortification programs in some developing countries, including Indonesia, is still limited. Thus, this study conducts a systematic review of the effects of food fortification of mothers and children using biochemical and anthropometric measures focusing on linear growth. Three databases were used in the literature search, namely PubMed, Science Direct and Google Scholar. Fifteen articles were included for analysis from 517 studies found consisting of Indonesian and English articles published from 2000 to June 2020. Fortification of iron, vitamin A, and iodine can increase the level of hemoglobin, serum ferritin, and serum retinol and median urine iodine excretion, especially in toddlers and schoolchildren. However, multinutrient fortification interventions were associated with various effects on hemoglobin, serum ferritin, and serum retinol but a positive association was found with linear growth indicators in the form of body length for age. The effectiveness of food fortification in reducing the prevalence of stunting still needs more and stronger evidence through studies with large sample size and longer duration.","Dewi NU, Mahmudiono T",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2021 Feb 22,Stunting AND Indonesia
32932006,Climate exposures and child undernutrition: Evidence from Indonesia.,"Global climate change has the potential to disrupt agricultural systems, undermine household socioeconomic status, and shape the prevalence and distribution of diseases. Each of these changes may influence children's nutritional status, which is sensitive to food availability, access, and utilization, and which may have lasting consequences for later-life health and socioeconomic outcomes. This paper contributes to the emerging literature on climate and child health by studying the effects of temperature and precipitation exposures on children's height and weight in Indonesia. Drawing on five rounds of the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) implemented between 1993 and 2015, we estimate fixed-effects regression models of height-for-age (HFA) and weight-for-height (WFH) among samples of children ages 24-59 months and 0-23 months, respectively. We test for heterogeneity in these effects across sub-populations expected to vary in their vulnerability. Results show that delays in monsoon onset are consistently associated with worse child health outcomes. Delays in monsoon onset during the prenatal period are associated with reduced child height among children age 2-4 years. The weight of young (<2 years) children is adversely affected by delays in the most recent monsoon season, and this relationship is particularly strong among residents of Java. Overall, our results underline the need for interventions that protect children's nutrition and underlying health against the effects of climate change.","Thiede BC, Gray C",Soc Sci Med,2020 Nov,Stunting AND Indonesia
22590968,Consumption of micronutrient-fortified milk and noodles is associated with lower risk of stunting in preschool-aged children in Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND: Stunting is highly prevalent in developing countries and is associated with greater morbidity and mortality. Micronutrient deficiencies contribute to stunting, and micronutrient-fortified foods are a potential strategy to reduce child stunting. OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between the use of fortified powdered milk and noodles and child stunting in a large, population-based sample of Indonesian children. METHODS: Consumption of fortified milk and fortified noodles was assessed in children 6 to 59 months of age from 222,250 families living in rural areas and 79,940 families living in urban slum areas in Indonesia. RESULTS: The proportions of children who consumed fortified milk and fortified noodles were 34.0% and 22.0%, respectively, in rural families, and 42.4% and 48.5%, respectively, in urban families. The prevalence of stunting among children from rural and urban families was 51.8% and 48.8%, respectively. Children from rural and urban families were less likely to be stunted if they consumed fortified milk (in rural areas, OR = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.85 to 0.90; p < .0001; in urban areas, OR = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.85; p < .0001) or fortified noodles (in rural areas, OR = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91 to 0.99;p = .02; in urban areas, OR = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.01; p = .08) in multiple logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders. In both rural and urban families, the odds of stunting were lower when a child who consumed fortified milk also consumed fortified noodles, or when a child who consumed fortified noodles also consumed fortified milk. CONCLUSIONS: The consumption of fortified milk and noodles is associated with decreased odds of stunting among Indonesian children. These findings add to a growing body of evidence regarding the potential benefits of multiple micronutrient fortification on child growth.","Semba RD, Moench-Pfanner R, Sun K, de Pee S, Akhter N, Rah JH, Campbell AA, Badham J, Bloem MW, Kraemer K",Food Nutr Bull,2011 Dec,Stunting AND Indonesia
33540885,Stunting as a Synonym of Social Disadvantage and Poor Parental Education.,"Socially, economically, politically and emotionally (SEPE) disadvantaged children are shorter than children from affluent background. In view of previous work on the lack of association between nutrition and child growth, we performed a study in urban schoolchildren. We measured 723 children (5.83 to 13.83 years); Kupang, Indonesia; three schools with different social background. We investigated anthropometric data, clinical signs of malnutrition, physical fitness, parental education, and household equipment. Subjective self-confidence was assessed by the MacArthur test. The prevalence of stunting was between 8.5% and 46.8%. Clinical signs of under- or malnutrition were absent even in the most underprivileged children. There was no delay in tooth eruption. Underprivileged children are physically fitter than the wealthy. The correlation between height and state of nutrition (BMI_SDS, skinfold_SDS, MUAC_SDS) ranged between r = 0.69 (p < 0.01) and r = 0.43 (p < 0.01) in private school children, and between r = 0.07 (ns) and r = 0.32 (p < 0.01) in the underprivileged children. Maternal education interacted with height in affluent (r = 0.20, p < 0.01) and in underprivileged children (r = 0.20, p < 0.01). The shortness of SEPE disadvantaged children was not associated with anthropometric and clinical signs of malnutrition, nor with delay in physical development. Stunting is a complex phenomenon and may be considered a synonym of social disadvantage and poor parental education.","Scheffler C, Hermanussen M, Soegianto SDP, Homalessy AV, Touw SY, Angi SI, Ariyani QS, Suryanto T, Matulessy GKI, Fransiskus T, Safira AVC, Puteri MN, Rahmani R, Ndaparoka DN, Payong MKE, Indrajati YD, Purba RKH, Manubulu RM, Julia M, Pulungan AB",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2021 Feb 2,Stunting AND Indonesia
39623134,"Water pollution and sanitation in Indonesia: a review on water quality, health and environmental impacts, management, and future challenges.","As an archipelagic tropical developing country, Indonesia is characterized by vast expanses of rural and isolated areas. This review aims to discuss water pollution and sanitation's existing condition, health, and environmental impacts, alongside its management and challenges in Indonesia. The systematic review approach was utilized to ensure transparency and replicability, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. Many water sources in Indonesia are contaminated by various pollutants such as heavy metals, microplastics, pesticides, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Moreover, the existing water and wastewater treatment plants cannot completely remove pollutants, including bacteria that cause waterborne diseases. The lack of proper sanitation facilities, including toilets and latrines, is not only reported in rural areas but also in peri-urban regions of Indonesia. This situation forces many to rely on unimproved water sources, such as river water, for their daily use and engage in open defecation, which may increase the risk of direct exposure to waterborne contaminants. Insufficient sanitation has been linked to significant public health issues in Indonesia, including maternal health complications, childhood stunting, and an increased incidence of waterborne diseases such as diarrhea. Based on the findings of this review, Indonesia still needs to improve its sanitation and water treatment facilities, as well as reduce pollution of the aquatic environment. This condition not only illustrates the condition of water and sanitation in Indonesia but can also be used as an illustration of how developing countries face various pollution and sanitation problems during the massive development and industry.","Wulandari R, Iswara AP, Qadafi M, Prayogo W, Astuti RDP, Utami RR, Jayanti M, Awfa D, Suryawan IWK, Fitria L, Andhikaputra G",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,2024 Dec,Stunting AND Indonesia
40352221,Improved sanitation and co-occurrence of anemia and stunting in Indonesian children: A retrospective cohort study.,"Anemia and stunting are major public health concerns in low- and middle-income countries, including Indonesia, with significant impacts on child development, morbidity, and mortality. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of improved sanitation on the co-occurrence of anemia and stunting (CAS) in Indonesian children using pooled data from the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) across three waves, from IFLS 3 in 2000, IFLS 4 in 2007, and IFLS 5 in 2014. The sample included 839 children aged 1-5 years with complete anthropometric and hemoglobin data, measured in 2000 as the baseline cohort and followed across subsequent waves. The main independent variable was improved sanitation, and other covariates included maternal and child characteristics, parental factors, and socio-economic status. Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess the impact of sanitation over time. The prevalence of CAS was 30.75% in 2000, 6.08% in 2007, and 4.29% in 2014. Stunting-only prevalence increased from 16.21% in 2000 to 27.41% in 2007 but decreased to 19.31% in 2014. Anemia-only prevalence decreased from 31.23% in 2000 to 10.25% in 2007 and slightly rose to 16.92% in 2014. The analysis found that children with unimproved sanitation were at significantly higher risk of CAS (crude relative risk ratio (RRR): 2.49; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.92-3.23), which decreased after adjusting for confounding factors (adjusted RRR: 1.55; 95%CI: 1.12-2.14). Similarly, the risk for anemia was higher in children with unimproved sanitation (adjusted RRR: 1. 43; 95%CI: 1.07-1.90). However, the risk for stunting was not statistically significant after adjustment. This study underscores the importance of improved sanitation in reducing anemia and stunting but also highlights the need to address other factors, such as nutrition, maternal health, and socioeconomic inequalities, through comprehensive public health policies.","Meiyetriani E, Utomo B",Narra J,2025 Apr,Stunting AND Indonesia
34866369,"Comparison of Indonesian Growth Reference Chart and World Health Organization Child Growth Standard in Detecting Stunting: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of 15,874 Children.","Recognition of an overestimation of stunted children in Indonesia when using the World Health Organization Child Growth Standards (WHOCGS) led to the creation of the Indonesian Growth Reference Chart (IGRC) in 2005, with further improvement in 2018. This systematic review aimed to determine whether there is a difference in the diagnosis of stunting when using these two charts. This systematic review is registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42021259934). Literature research was performed on PubMed, Science Direct, Medline, Scielo, Medrxiv, Research Square, SSRN, and Biorxiv to identify studies published from 2018 onwards that examined the comparison of IGRC and WHOCGS in detecting stunting. Three studies were included in this review. Pooled analysis showed that IGRC resulted in a lower prevalence of stunted and severely stunted children [risk ratio (RR): 0.28 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.15-0.51), p<0.0001, I(2)=97%]. Comparison between IGRC and WHOGCS for prevalence of normal height children showed that there was no difference, and this finding was not significant [RR: 1.56 (95% CI: 0.92-2.66), p=0.1, I(2)=100%], and the comparison for prevalence of tall children also showed that there was no difference when using IGRC or WHOGCS, and this finding was also insignificant [RR: 2.02 (95% CI: 0.78-5.20), p=0.14, I(2)=98%]. This meta-analysis showed that stunted and severely stunted Indonesian children are over-represented using WHOCGS. The difference between IGRC and WHOCGS has occurred because of the sample population, as IGRC includes children from all 33 provinces in Indonesia, better reflecting the growth of all children in Indonesia.","Octavius GS, br.

30685774,Pesticide Exposure and Stunting among Children in Agricultural Areas.,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of growth disorders among school-aged children in Indonesia is high (30.7%). Pesticides have been massively used in Indonesian agricultural areas. OBJECTIVE: To determine if exposure to pesticides is associated with stunting among children in agricultural areas. METHODS: This case-control study included 160 children (48 cases and 112 controls) aged 8-12 years. Exposure to pesticides was measured based on the history of the exposure since perinatal period, infancy, and childhood of the participants. Stunting was determined as a height for age z-score (HAZ) < ‑2 SD. Other variables measured were levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), hemoglobin, zinc, albumin, nutrient adequacy level (energy and protein), and history of infection, low-birth weight (LBW), and mother's height. RESULTS: There were no significant difference between the cases and controls in terms of in the baseline characteristics, except for the median IGF-1 level; it was significantly (p<0.001) lower in the cases (66.73 ng/mL) than the controls (112.57 ng/mL). High level of pesticide exposure (p=0.029) and low IGF-1 levels (p<0.001) were significantly associated with stunting. After adjusting for confounding variables, these variables were found to be independent risk factors for stunting in children (aOR 3.90, 95% CI 1.15 to 13.26; and aOR 8.35, 95% CI 3.65 to 19.14, respectively). CONCLUSION: Pesticide exposure could be a risk factor for the occurrence of growth disorders in children living in agricultural areas. Necessary actions should be taken to protect children living in agricultural areas from exposure to pesticides.","Kartini A, Subagio HW, Hadisaputro S, Kartasurya MI, Suhartono S, Budiyono B",Int J Occup Environ Med,2019 Jan,Stunting AND Indonesia
34929819,Use of technology for monitoring the development of nutritional status 1000 hpk in stunting prevention in Indonesia.,"OBJECTIVE: This study is reviewed about the use of technology to monitor the nutritional status of the first thousand days of life (1000 HPK), a program in Indonesia to prevent stunting. METHOD: In this study, which is looking for journals used in the literature review, journals used in literature review obtained through the database of international journal providers such as Google scholar, PubMed, and Proquest. Researchers wrote the appropriate keywords, namely nutritional status of 1000 HPK, stunting, and application. The year limit used is ten years from 2010 to 2020. RESULTS: Nutritional status in the first thousand days of life (1000 HPK), which is 270 days during pregnancy and 730 days in the baby's first life, is critical because the consequences are permanent and irreparable. Pregnant women and toddlers who are less attentive about their food intake will impact nutritional problems or nutritional status that will then affect their development in the future. The level of optimal nutritional status will be achieved if nutritional needs are met, but on the contrary unbalanced nutrition can cause several diseases, including stunting. Monitoring the development of toddlers is very important to know the existence of growth disorders early on, by taking weight measurement as the best way to assess the nutritional status of pregnant women and toddlers every month so that the child's growth will be monitored. One tool for measuring nutritional status is to use applications, and technological advances have now undergone rapid development. Application is a multifunctional product with all its sophistication which can help humans in various ways. CONCLUSION: From some journals can be concluded that the use of applications in monitoring the nutritional status of 1000 HPK facilitates parents, midwives, and other health workers in working to monitor the nutritional development of pregnant women and the growth of infants and toddlers for stunting prevention.","Hijrawati, Usman AN, Syarif S, Hadju V, As'ad S, Baso YS",Gac Sanit,2021,Stunting AND Indonesia
28244711,Information exposure and growth monitoring favour child nutrition in rural Indonesia.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Malnutrition is a health problem among under-five children in Indonesia. The mothers' knowledge on nutrition and health in addition to growth monitoring program are essential components that may influence nutritional status of children under-five. The objective was to observe the importance of maternal information exposure along with growth monitoring program to the nutritional status of children in rural areas. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: A cross sectional study of 233 randomly selected mothers of under-five children from different geographical rural settings in Indonesia were interviewed and observed as to their exposure to nutrition and health information, growth monitoring program and nutritional status of the children. RESULTS: The prevalence of underweight, stunting, and wasting was 50.5%, 18.0%, and 28.4%, respectively. The mean of height-for-age z score was similar across villages, however, the mean of weight-for-age (p=0.039) and weightfor- height (p=0.047) were significantly lower in Kenduren compared with Karangrejo village. The possession of a growth monitoring card in Kenduren was significantly lower compared with Karangrejo (p<0.001) or Buko villages (p<0.001). The prevalence of underweight (p=0.001) or stunting (p=0.021) was higher among children who did not possess a growth monitoring card. The prevalence of stunting was higher among children who did not routinely go to Posyandu (Integrated Health Post) in the last 3 months (p=0.018). CONCLUSION: Maternal exposure to nutrition and health information, along with growth monitoring programs, contribute to the prevalence of underweight and stunting among rural children who are under-five years old.","Sahanggamu PD, Purnomosari L, Dillon D",Asia Pac J Clin Nutr,2017 Mar,Stunting AND Indonesia
39595424,The Importance of Interprofessional Collaboration (IPC) Guidelines in Stunting Management in Indonesia: A Systematic Review.,"Background: Indonesia's stunting prevention programs have shown limited effectiveness and scalability. Interprofessional collaboration (IPC) is crucial for preventing and treating pediatric stunting. This study aimed to investigate the roles of primary health centers and IPC in addressing stunting in Indonesia. Methods: A systematic review was conducted, searching PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, ProQuest, and Google Scholar for studies up to November 2023. Two reviewers independently screened and included full-text articles that examined IPC and stunting, focusing on prevalence, policy implications, healthcare roles, community roles, preventive measures, and challenges. Results: The review included 52 articles. IPC was found to be critical in reducing stunting prevalence. Training improved the knowledge of health cadres, aiding in the early detection and prevention of stunting. The studies emphasized IPC's positive impact on stunting reduction across various regions. Policymakers are encouraged to adopt a comprehensive strategy involving collaboration, financial support, and effective program implementation. Conclusions: This study highlights IPC as essential in reducing stunting in Indonesia. Integrating stunting management into primary healthcare is recommended, with a call for developing guidelines to standardize and optimize the approach to this public health issue.","Sentika R, Setiawan T, Kusnadi, Rattu DJ, Yunita I, Masita BM, Basrowi RW",Healthcare (Basel),2024 Nov 7,Stunting AND Indonesia
36143913,"Stunting as a Risk Factor for Asthma: The Role of Vitamin D, Leptin, IL-4, and CD23.","Stunting, which results from chronic malnutrition, is common in children from low- and middle-income countries. Several studies have reported an association between obesity and asthma. However, only a handful of studies have identified stunting as a significant risk factor for wheezing, a symptom of asthma, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. This article aimed to review possible mechanisms underlying asthma in stunted children. Overall, changes in diet or nutritional status and deficiencies in certain nutrients, such as vitamin D, can increase the risk of developing asthma. Vitamin D deficiency can cause linear growth disorders such as stunting in children, with lower levels of 25(OH)D found in underweight and stunted children. Stunted children show a decreased lean body mass, which affects lung growth and function. Low leptin levels during undernutrition cause a Th1-Th2 imbalance toward Th2, resulting in increased interleukin (IL)-4 cytokine production and total immunoglobulin E (IgE). Studies in stunted underweight children have also found an increase in the proportion of the total number of B cells with low-affinity IgE receptors (CD23+). CD23+ plays an important role in allergen presentation that is facilitated by IgE to T cells and strongly activates allergen-specific T cells and the secretion of Th2-driving cytokines. Stunted children present with low vitamin D and leptin levels, impaired lung growth, decreased lung function, and increased IL-4 and CD23+ levels. All of these factors may be considered consequential in asthma in stunted children.","Sapartini G, Wong GWK, Indrati AR, Kartasasmita CB, Setiabudiawan B",Medicina (Kaunas),2022 Sep 7,Stunting AND Indonesia

37415330,Association of Maternal Education With Nutritional Outcomes of Poor Children With Stunting in Indonesia.,"The consequences of poverty and food insecurity can indirectly contribute to obesity. Long-term effect of stunting children may be the risk factor for overweight and obesity in the poor in Indonesia. The role of parental education is also associated with overweight and obesity in children. This study aimed to observe the risk of stunted children becoming overweight and obese based on maternal education among poor people in Indonesia. This study involved three cohorts design. Cohort 1 is a 14-year cohort, and two 7-year cohorts for cohorts 2 and 3. We used secondary longitudinal data from Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) 3 (2000), IFLS 4 (2007), and IFLS 5 (2014). After stratification by high maternal education and economic status of the family, there is an increased risk of stunting children becoming overweight and obese, with a risk ratio of 2 in cohort 1 and 1.69 in cohort 2. These results showed that stunted children with high-education mothers and lived in the low-income families have a 1.69 to 2 times higher risk of becoming overweight and obese. Thus, the importance of primary education and health education for women to increase children's health in the future.","Handayani NS, Huriyati E, Hasanbasri M",Asia Pac J Public Health,2023 Jul,Stunting AND Indonesia
37917759,"Path analysis model for preventing stunting in dryland area island East Nusa Tenggara Province, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: The problem of stunting is still a fundamental problem in Indonesia's human development. East Nusa Tenggara Province is an archipelago dryland area where in 2007-2021 it has contributed to the highest number of stunting children prevalence in Indonesia. This study aims to determine the relationship of variables in individual, household and district level with the prevalence of stunting. METHODS: This type of research is observational study with a cross sectional design. This study used individual secondary data from the Indonesian Nutritional Status Survey in 2021 consisting of 7,835 toddlers and National Social Economics Survey 2021. RESULTS: This research found that both specific & sensitive intervention programs had an influence in accelerating the decline in stunting prevalence (higher score on Z Score). Results also revealed the positive influence of the food access variable on nutritional intake. The results of the path analysis test showed that sensitive intervention program variables have a positive effect on food access variable and environmental variable (environmental sanitation) such as the habit of open defecation and healthcare. There was significant relationship on disease history, environment and intake to Height for Age (HAZ) score. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, direct and indirect factors have important roles to prevent stunting. Sensitive and specific intervention program, food access, macro determinants and environment are the indirect indicators which contribute significantly to the stunting. The risk of children under five years old experiencing malnourished nutritional status increases with a history of infectious disease (diarrhea, ARI, worms). The risk of children under five years experiencing malnourished nutritional status decreases with adequate nutritional intake. It is hoped that there will be a special model of stunting control interventions at the individual level and at the family, household and district level that are integrated and of high quality through multisectoral cooperation in the dryland areas of the islands of East Nusa Tenggara Province.","Picauly I, Adi AAAM, Meiyetriani E, Mading M, Weraman P, Nashriyah SF, Hidayat AT, Boeky DLA, Lobo V, Saleh A, Peni JA",PLoS One,2023,Stunting AND Indonesia
32905084,Maternal feeding practice and its relationship with stunting in children.,"The incidence of stunting in children is a crucial problem that remains challenging to tackle and is caused by multiple factors.

36513341,Eating Behavior and Caries Experience in Children with Growth Stunting.,"OBJECTIVE:  Stunting is the impaired growth and development children experience from chronic malnutrition and repeated infection that cause long-term damage. Malnutrition for a long time will affect the shape and composition of bones and teeth, making children more vulnerable to dental health problems. Preschoolers with sufficiently active consumption can choose the food they like delightful foods so that it can increase the risk of caries. Based on data from the Bandung City Health Office in 2019, 161 toddlers (25.43%) in Sukawarna Village experienced stunting. This study analyzed the relationship between eating behavior and caries experience in stunting children in Sukawarna Village, Sukajadi District. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  This study uses a quantitative descriptive research method with a secondary data analysis approach from the documentation of the Universitas Padjadjaran Academic Leadership Grant data with the title ""Aspects of jaw growth-development and family approach in early detection and prevention of stunting."" Sampling used purposive sampling specifically for preschool children with a sample size of 80 respondents. The data obtained will be processed and then analyzed using the Spearman Rank correlation statistical test. RESULTS:  Sixty-three percent of respondents have poor eating behavior, and the majority (80.35%) have cavities due to caries (decay). Spearman Rank correlation coefficient is -0.145 and significance is 0.0983. CONCLUSION:  Overall eating behavior is related to the caries experience in stunting children. Consumption of cariogenic foods influences the caries experience.","Sari RP, Rahayuwati L, Setiawan AS",Eur J Dent,2024 Feb,Stunting AND Indonesia
39100399,Maternal Complications during Pregnancy and Risk Factors for Stunting.,"BACKGROUND: Stunting can be prevented by early detection when the mother is pregnant. Early detection can be carried out by looking for risk factors of stunting during pregnancy so that interventions can be early detected. This study aims to assess complications during pregnancy (disease and infection) and risk factors associated with stunting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The type of research was observational analytic with a case-control design on 450 mothers who were selected with simple random sampling (150 mothers who have stunting babies aged 0-2 months and 300 mothers who have not stunting babies aged 0-2 months in Malang Regency, Indonesia. This study used secondary data by looking at medical records, namely, laboratory examinations in the mother's book and cohort records at the public health center. This study was conducted from December 2021 to August 2022. Bivariate analysis with Chi-square and multivariate logistic regression was carried out to determine the variables that most influenced the incidence of stunting. RESULTS: The results of multivariate analysis with logistic regression of maternal complications during pregnancy, which are a risk as a factor causing stunting, are Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) (Odds Ratio [OR]: 6.36; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 2.97-13.62), coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) accompanied by pneumonia (OR: 5.12; 95% CI: 1.87-14.052), human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) (OR: 4.63; 95% CI: 1.10-19.59), hepatitis B (OR: 3.97; 95% CI: 1.253-12.565), pre-eclampsia (OR: 3.88; 95% CI: 1.81-8.30), and heart disease (OR: 3.373; 95% CI: 0.99-11.40). CONCLUSIONS: After recognizing the maternal factors that cause stunting, intervention should immediately be carried out on pregnant women with diseases (pre-eclampsia and heart disease) and infections (STI, COVID-19 + pneumonia, HIV/AIDS, and hepatitis B) to prevent stunting early.","Maulina R, Qomaruddin MB, Prasetyo B, Indawati R",Iran J Nurs Midwifery Res,2024 May-Jun,Stunting AND Indonesia
34100353,Malnutrition in early life and its neurodevelopmental and cognitive consequences: a scoping review.,"The negative impact of stunting and severe underweight on cognitive neurodevelopment of children is well documented; however, the effect of overweight/obesity is still unclear. The 2018 Global Nutrition Report reported that stunting and overweight concurrently affect 189 million children worldwide. As existing reviews discuss undernutrition and overweight/obesity separately, this scoping review aims to document the impact of mild/moderate and severe underweight, stunting, and overweight/obesity among children aged 0-60 months on their cognitive neurodevelopmental trajectories. Twenty-six articles were analysed to extract significant information from literature retrieved from PubMed and Cochrane databases published from 1 January 2009 to 31 October 2019. Length gain is associated with cognitive neurodevelopment in normo-nourished and stunted children aged under 24 months. Among stunted children, it seems that cognitive and neurodevelopmental deficits can potentially be recovered before 8 years of age, particularly in those whose nutritional status has improved. The impact of overweight/obesity on cognitive neurodevelopment appears to be limited to attention, gross motor skills and executive control. Parental education level, birth weight/length, breastfeeding duration, and sanitation level are some identifiable factors that modify the impact of undernutrition and overweight/obesity on cognitive and neurodevelopment. In conclusion, underweight, stunting and overweight/obesity have a significant impact on cognitive neurodevelopment. Multidimensional approaches with various stakeholders should address all issues simultaneously, such as improving sanitation levels, assuring parental job security and adequate social welfare, and providing access to adequate nutrients for catch-up growth among underweight or stunted children and to affordable healthy foods for those who are overweight/obese and from low socio-economic status.","Suryawan A, Jalaludin MY, Poh BK, Sanusi R, Tan VMH, Geurts JM, Muhardi L",Nutr Res Rev,2022 Jun,Stunting AND Indonesia
35865219,"Chicken liver and eggshell crackers as a safe and affordable animal source food for overcoming micronutrient deficits during pregnancy and lactation in Indonesia: a double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial (SISTIK Growth Study).","Background: Indonesia ranks fifth in terms of the number of stunted children and there has been little change in the stunting prevalence in the last decade. In earlier observational studies conducted in 2014-2015, we identified several key underlying problems with the potential to impact stunting in Sumedang district, West Java, Indonesia. Deficits in intakes of growth-limiting micronutrients were observed, most notably calcium, iron, zinc, and vitamin A, emphasizing the need for a food-based intervention to overcome these micronutrient deficits in the diets of mothers and their infants. Methods: A double-blind placebo-controlled cluster randomised trial comparing the effect of daily consumption of 75 grams of locally produced micronutrient-enriched crackers (MEC) (intervention group) compared to placebo crackers (control group) by mothers at two-time intervals: (i) from the 8-14 weeks of pregnancy to delivery (i.e., 28-34 weeks of consumption of MEC) on birth length, and (ii) from the 8-14 weeks of pregnancy to 5 months post-partum on attained linear growth and linear growth velocity of breast-fed infants. A total of 324 pregnant women from 28 clusters (villages) located in 3 sub-districts in Sumedang district, West Java, Indonesia, will be randomly assigned to either intervention (n=14 villages) or control (n=14 villages). Discussi on: This will be the first study in Indonesia to use crackers based on powdered eggshells and chicken liver, in a form which is acceptable, safe, and has a long shelf life. If daily consumption of MEC for 6 months during pregnancy can enhance birth length, or their continued daily consumption for 5 months postpartum improves both attained and incremental linear growth at 5 months of age, then scaling-up in Indonesia may be considered.
