the 21st century a previous study ha quantified the global and regional burden of amr for 2019 followed with additional publication that provided more detailed estimate for several who region by country to date there have been no study that produce comprehensive estimate of amr burden across location that encompass historical trend and future forecast method we estimated allage and agespecific death and disabilityadjusted lifeyears dalys attributable to and associated with bacterial amr for 22 pathogen 84 pathogendrug combination and 11 infectious syndrome in 204 country and territory from 1990 to 2021 we collected and used multiple cause of death data hospital discharge data microbiology data literature study single drug resistance profile pharmaceutical sale antibiotic use survey mortality surveillance linkage data outpatient and inpatient insurance claim data and previously published data covering 520 million individual record or isolates and 19 513 studylocationyears we used statistical modelling to produce estimate of amr burden for all location including those with no data our approach leverage the estimation of five broad component quantity the number of death involving sepsis the proportion of infectious death attributable to a given infectious syndrome the proportion of infectious syndrome death attributable to a given pathogen the percentage of a given pathogen resistant to an antibiotic of interest and the excess risk of death or duration of an infection associated with this resistance using these component we estimated disease burden attributable to and associated with amr which we define based on two counterfactuals respectively an alternative scenario in which all drugresistant infection are replaced by drugsusceptible infection and an alternative scenario in which all drugresistant infection were replaced by no infection additionally we produced global and regional forecast of amr burden until 2050 for three scenario a reference scenario that is a probabilistic forecast of the most likely future a gramnegative drug scenario that assumes future drug development that target gramnegative pathogen and a better care scenario that assumes future improvement in healthcare quality and access to appropriate antimicrobial we present final estimate aggregated to the global superregional and regional level finding in 2021 we estimated 471 million 95 ui 423519 death were associated with bacterial amr including 114 million 100128 death attributable to bacterial amr trend in amr mortality over the past 31 year varied substantially by age and location from 1990 to 2021 death from amr decreased by more than 50 among child younger than 5 year yet increased by over 80 for adult 70 year and older amr mortality decreased for child younger than 5 year in all superregions whereas amr mortality in people 5 year and older increased in all superregions for both death associated with and death attributable to amr meticillinresistant staphylococcus aureus increased the most globally from 261 000 associated death 95 ui 150 000372 000 and 57 200 attributable death 34 10080 300 in 1990 to 550

from 619 000 associated death 405 000834 000 in 1990 to 103 million associated death 909 000116 million in 2021 and from 127 000 attributable death 82 100171 000 in 1990 to 216 000 168 000264 000 attributable death in 2021 there wa a notable decrease in noncovidrelated infectious disease in 2020 and 2021 our forecast show that an estimated 191 million 156226 death attributable to amr and 822 million 685965 death associated with amr could occur globally in 2050 superregions with the highest allage amr mortality rate in 2050 are forecasted to be south asia and latin america and the caribbean increase in death attributable to amr will be largest among those 70 year and older 659 612698 of allage death attributable to amr in 2050 in stark contrast to the strong increase in number of death due to amr of 696 515892 from 2022 to 2050 the number of dalys showed a much smaller increase of 94 69 to 290 to 465 million 377 to 573 in 2050 under the better care scenario across all age group 920 million death 8281020 could be cumulatively averted between 2025 and 2050 through better care of severe infection and improved access to antibiotic and under the gramnegative drug scenario 111 million amr death 908132 could be averted through the development of a gramnegative drug pipeline to prevent amr death interpretation this study present the first comprehensive assessment of the global burden of amr from 1990 to 2021 with result forecasted until 2050 evaluating changing trend in amr mortality across time and location is necessary to understand how this important global health threat is developing and prepares u to make informed decision regarding intervention our finding show the importance of infection prevention a shown by the reduction of amr death in those younger than 5 year simultaneously our result underscore the concerning trend of amr burden among those older than 70 year alongside a rapidly ageing global community the opposing trend in the burden of amr death between younger and older individual explains the moderate future increase in global number of dalys versus number of death given the high variability of amr burden by location and age it is important that intervention combine infection prevention vaccination minimisation of inappropriate antibiotic use in farming and human and research into new antibiotic to mitigate the number of amr death that are forecasted for 2050 funding uk department of health and social care fleming fund using uk aid and the wellcome trust

for both policy maker and practitioner in the usa a such insight can facilitate effective planning investment and implementation strategy forecasting trend in disease and injury burden is not only crucial for policy maker but also garner substantial interest from the general populace and lead to a betterinformed public through the integration of new data source the refinement of methodology and the inclusion of additional cause we have improved our previous forecasting effort within the scope of the global burden of disease injury and risk factor study gbd to produce forecast at the state and national level for the usa under various possible scenario method we developed a comprehensive framework for forecasting life expectancy healthy life expectancy hale causespecific mortality and disabilityadjusted lifeyears dalys due to 359 cause of disease and injury burden from 2022 to 2050 for the usa and all 50 state and washington dc using the gbd 2021 future health scenario modelling framework we forecasted driver of disease demographic driver risk factor temperature and particulate matter mortality and year of life lost yll population and nonfatal burden in addition to a reference scenario representing the most probable future trajectory we explored various future scenario and their potential impact over the next several decade on human health these alternative scenario comprised four risk elimination scenario including safer environment improved behavioural and metabolic risk improved childhood nutrition and vaccination and a combined scenario and three usaspecific scenario based on risk exposure or attributable burden in the bestperforming u state improved high adult bmi and high fasting plasma glucose fpg improved smoking and improved drug use encompassing opioids cocaine amphetamine and others finding life expectancy in the usa is projected to increase from 783 year 95 uncertainty interval 781785 in 2022 to 799 year 795802 in 2035 and to 804 year 798810 in 2050 for all sex combined this increase is forecasted to be modest compared with that in other country around the world resulting in the usa declining in global rank over the 202250 forecasted period among the 204 country and territory in gbd from 49th to 66th there is projected to be a decline in female life expectancy in west virginia between 1990 and 2050 and little change in arkansas and oklahoma additionally after 2023 we projected almost no change in female life expectancy in many state notably in oklahoma south dakota utah iowa maine and wisconsin female hale is projected to decline between 1990 and 2050 in 20 state and to remain unchanged in three others drug use disorder and low back pain are projected to be the leading level 3 cause of agestandardised dalys in 2050 the agestandardised daly rate due to drug use disorder is projected to increase considerably between 2022 and 2050 195 69341 our combined risk elimination scenario show that the usa could gain 38 additional year 3640 of life expectancy and 41 additional year 3943 of hale in 2050 versus the reference scenario using our usaspecific scenario we forecasted that the usa could gain 04 additional year 0306 of life expectancy and 06 additional year 0508 of hale in 2050 under the improved drug use scenario relative to the reference scenario life expectancy and hale are likewise projected to be 0405 year higher in 2050 under the improved adult bmi and fpg and improved smoking scenario compared with the reference scenario however the increase in these scenario would not substantially improve the usa global ranking in 2050 from 66th of 204 in life expectancy in the reference scenario to 63rd64th in each of the three usaspecific scenario indicating that the usa bestperforming state are still lagging behind other country in their rank throughout the forecasted period regardless an estimated 124 million 113135 death could be averted between 2022 and 2050 if the usa were to follow the combined scenario trajectory rather than the reference scenario there would also be 14 million 0722 fewer death over the 28year forecasted period with improved adult bmi and fpg 21 million 1329 fewer death with improved exposure to smoking and 12 million 0915 fewer death with lower rate of drug use death interpretation our finding highlight the alarming trajectory of health challenge in the usa which if left unaddressed could lead to a reversal of the health progress made over the past three decade for some u state and a decline in global health standing for all state the evidence from our alternative scenario along with other published study suggests that through collaborative evidencebased strategy there are opportunity to change the trajectory of health outcome in the usa such a by investing in scientific innovation healthcare access preventive health care risk exposure reduction and education our forecast clearly show that the time to act is now a

38801001,a concept for international societally relevant microbiology education and microbiology knowledge promulgation in society,executive summary microbe are all pervasive in their distribution and influence on the functioning and wellbeing of human life in general and the planet microbiallybased technology contribute hugely to the supply of important good and service we depend upon such a the provision of food medicine and clean water they also offer mechanism and strategy to mitigate and solve a wide range of problem and crisis facing humanity at all level including those encapsulated in the sustainable development goal sdgs formulated by the united nation for example microbial technology can contribute in multiple way to decarbonisation and hence confronting global warming provide sanitation and clean water to the billion of people lacking them improve soil fertility and hence food production and develop vaccine and other medicine to reduce and in some case eliminate deadly infection they are the foundation of biotechnology an increasingly important and growing business sector and source of employment and the centre of the bioeconomy green deal etc but because microbe are largely invisible they are not familiar to most people so opportunity they offer to effectively prevent and solve problem are often missed by decisionmakers with the negative consequence this entrains to correct this lack of vital knowledge the international microbiology literacy initiativethe imiliis recruiting from the global microbiology community and making freely available teaching resource for a curriculum in societally relevant microbiology that can be used at all level of learning it goal is the development of a society that is literate in relevant microbiology and a a consequence able to take full advantage of the potential of microbe and minimise the consequence of their negative activity in addition to teaching about microbe almost every lesson discusses the influence they have on sustainability and the sdgs and their ability to solve pressing problem of societal inequality the curriculum thus teach about sustainability societal need and global citizenship the lesson also reveal the impact microbe and their activity have on our daily life at the personal family community national and global level and their relevance for decision at all level and because effective evidencebased decision require not only relevant information but also critical and system thinking the resource also teach about these key generic aspect of deliberation the imili teaching resource are learnercentric not academic microbiologycentric and deal with the microbiology of everyday issue these span topic a diverse a owning and caring for a companion animal the vast range of everyday food that are produced via microbial process impressive geological formation created by microbe childhood illness and how they are managed and how to reduce waste and pollution they also leverage the exceptional excitement of exploration and discovery that typifies much progress in microbiology to capture the interest inspire and motivate educator and learner alike the imili is establishing regional centre to translate the teaching resource into regional language and adapt them to regional culture and to promote their use and assist educator employing them two of these are now operational the regional centre constitute the interface between resource creator and educatorslearners a such they will collect and analyse feedback from the endusers and transmit this to the resource creator so that teaching material can be improved and refined and new resource added in response to demand educator and learner will thereby be directly involved in evolution of the teaching resource the interaction between educatorslearners and resource creator mediated by the regional centre will establish dynamic and synergistic relationshipsa global societally relevant microbiology education ecosystemin which creator also become learner teaching resource are optimised and all playersstakeholders are empowered and their motivation increased the imili concept thus embrace the principle of teaching societally relevant microbiology embedded in the wider context of societal biosphere and planetary need inequality the range of crisis that confront u and the need for improved decisioning which should ultimately lead to better citizenship and a humanity that is more sustainable and resilient abstract the biosphere of planet earth is a microbial world a vast reactor of countless microbially driven chemical transformation and energy transfer that push and pull many planetary geochemical process including the cycling of the element of life mitigate or amplify climate change eg nature review microbiology 2019 17 569 and impact the wellbeing and activity of all organism including human microbe are both our ancestor and creator of the planetary chemistry that allowed u to evolve eg life engine how microbe made earth habitable 2023 to understand how the biosphere function how human can influence it development and live more sustainably with the other organism sharing it we need to understand the microbe in a recent editorial environmental microbiology 2019 21 1513 we advocated for improved microbiology literacy in society our concept of microbiology literacy is not based on knowledge of the academic subject of microbiology with it multitude of component topic plus the growing number of additional topic from other discipline that become vitally important element of current microbiology rather it is focused on microbial activity that impact usindividualscommunitiesnationsthe human worldand the biosphere and that are key to reaching informed decision on a multitude of issue that regularly confront u ranging from personal issue to crisis of global importance in other word it is knowledge and understanding essential for adulthood and the transition to it knowledge and understanding that must be acquired early in life in school the 2019 editorial marked the launch of the international microbiology literacy initiative the imili here we present our concept of how microbiology literacy may be achieved and the rationale underpinning it the type of teaching resource being created to realise the concept and the framing of microbial activity treated in these resource in the context of sustainability societal need and responsibility and decisionmaking and the key role of regional centre that will translate the teaching resource into local language adapt them according to local cultural need interface with regional educator and develop and serve a hub of microbiology literacy education network the topic featuring in teaching resource are learnercentric and have been selected for their inherent relevance interest and ability to excite and engage importantly the resource coherently integrate and emphasise the overarching issue of sustainability stewardship and critical thinking and the pervasive interdependency of process more broadly the concept emphasis how the multifarious application of microbial activity can be leveraged to promote humananimal plant environmental and planetary health improve social equity alleviate humanitarian deficit and cause of conflict among people and increase understanding between people microbial biotechnology 2023 166 10911111 importantly although the primary target of the freely available cc bync 40 imili teaching resource is schoolchildren and their educator they and the teaching philosophy are intended for all age ability and cultural spectrum of learner worldwide in university education lifelong learning curiositydriven webbased knowledge acquisition and public outreach the imili teaching resource aim to promote development of a global microbiology education ecosystem that democratises microbiology knowledge

civilization in field a diverse a medicine electronics aerospace construction food packaging and sport it is now clear however that plastic are also responsible for significant harm to human health the economy and the earth environment these harm occur at every stage of the plastic life cycle from extraction of the coal oil and gas that are it main feedstock through to ultimate disposal into the environment the extent of these harm not been systematically assessed their magnitude not fully quantified and their economic cost not comprehensively counted goal the goal of this minderoomonaco commission on plastic and human health are to comprehensively examine plastic impact across their life cycle on 1 human health and wellbeing 2 the global environment especially the ocean 3 the economy and 4 vulnerable populationsthe poor minority and the world child on the basis of this examination the commission offer sciencebased recommendation designed to support development of a global plastic treaty protect human health and save life report structure this commission report contains seven section following an introduction section 2 present a narrative review of the process involved in plastic production use and disposal and note the hazard to human health and the environment associated with each of these stage section 3 describes plastic impact on the ocean and note the potential for plastic in the ocean to enter the marine food web and result in human exposure section 4 detail plastic impact on human health section 5 present a firstorder estimate of plastic healthrelated economic cost section 6 examines the intersection between plastic social inequity and environmental injustice section 7 present the commission finding and recommendation plastic plastic are complex highly heterogeneous synthetic chemical material over 98 of plastic are produced from fossil carbon coal oil and gas plastic are comprised of a carbonbased polymer backbone and thousand of additional chemical that are incorporated into polymer to convey specific property such a color flexibility stability water repellence flame retardation and ultraviolet resistance many of these added chemical are highly toxic they include carcinogen neurotoxicants and endocrine disruptors such a phthalates bisphenols per and polyfluoroalkyl substance pfas brominated flame retardant and organophosphate flame retardant they are integral component of plastic and are responsible for many of plastic harm to human health and the environmentglobal plastic production ha increased almost exponentially since world war ii and in this time more than 8300 megaton mt of plastic have been manufactured annual production volume ha grown from under 2 mt in 1950 to 460 mt in 2019 a 230fold increase and is on track to triple by 2060 more than half of all plastic ever made ha been produced since 2002 singleuse plastic account for 3540 of current plastic production and represent the most rapidly growing segment of plastic manufactureexplosive recent growth in plastic production reflects a deliberate pivot by the integrated multinational fossilcarbon corporation that produce coal oil and gas and that also manufacture plastic these corporation are reducing their production of fossil fuel and increasing plastic manufacture the two principal factor responsible for this pivot are decreasing global demand for carbonbased fuel due to increase in green energy and massive expansion of oil and gas production due to frackingplastic manufacture is energyintensive and contributes significantly to climate change at present plastic production is responsible for an estimated 37 of global greenhouse gas emission more than the contribution of brazil this fraction is projected to increase to 45 by 2060 if current trend continue unchecked plastic life cycle the plastic life cycle ha three phase production use and disposal in production carbon feedstockscoal gas and oilare transformed through energyintensive catalytic process into a vast array of product plastic use occurs in every aspect of modern life and result in widespread human exposure to the chemical contained in plastic singleuse plastic constitute the largest portion of current use followed by synthetic fiber and constructionplastic disposal is highly inefficient with recovery and recycling rate below 10 globally the result is that an estimated 22 mt of plastic waste enters the environment each year much of it singleuse plastic and are added to the more than 6 gigatons of plastic waste that have accumulated since 1950 strategy for disposal of plastic waste include controlled and uncontrolled landfilling open burning thermal conversion and export vast quantity of plastic waste are exported each year from highincome to lowincome country where it accumulates in landfill pollutes air and water degrades vital ecosystem befouls beach and estuary and harm human healthenvironmental injustice on a global scale plasticladen ewaste is particularly problematic environmental finding plastic and plasticassociated chemical are responsible for widespread pollution they contaminate aquatic marine and freshwater terrestrial and atmospheric environment globally the ocean is the ultimate destination for much plastic and plastic are found throughout the ocean including coastal region the sea surface the deep sea and polar sea ice many plastic appear to resist breakdown in the ocean and could persist in the global environment for decade macro and microplastic particle have been identified in hundred of marine specie in all major taxon including specie consumed by human trophic transfer of microplastic particle and the chemical within them ha been demonstrated although microplastic particle themselves 10 microm appear not to undergo biomagnification hydrophobic plasticassociated chemical bioaccumulate in marine animal and biomagnify in marine food web the amount and fate of smaller microplastic and nanoplastic particle mnps 10 microm in aquatic environment are poorly understood but the potential for harm is worrying given their mobility in biological system adverse environmental impact of plastic pollution occur at multiple level from molecular and biochemical to population and ecosystem mnp contamination of seafood result in direct though not well quantified human exposure to plastic

mnps formed through the environmental degradation of plastic waste can enter living organism including human emerging albeit still incomplete evidence indicates that mnps may cause toxicity due to their physical and toxicological effect a well a by acting a vector that transport toxic chemical and bacterial pathogen into tissue and cellsinfants in the womb and young child are two population at particularly high risk of plasticrelated health effect because of the exquisite sensitivity of early development to hazardous chemical and childrens unique pattern of exposure plasticassociated exposure are linked to increased risk of prematurity stillbirth low birth weight birth defect of the reproductive organ neurodevelopmental impairment impaired lung growth and childhood cancer earlylife exposure to plasticassociated chemical also increase the risk of multiple noncommunicable disease later in life economic finding plastic harm to human health result in significant economic cost we estimate that in 2015 the healthrelated cost of plastic production exceeded 250 billion 2015 int globally and that in the usa alone the health cost of disease and disability caused by the plasticassociated chemical pbde bpa and dehp exceeded 920 billion 2015 int plastic production result in greenhouse gas ghg emission equivalent to 196 gigatons of carbon dioxide co2e annually using the u environmental protection agency epa social cost of carbon metric we estimate the annual cost of these ghg emission to be 341 billion 2015 intthese cost large a they are almost certainly underestimate the full economic loss resulting from plastic negative impact on human health and the global environment all of plastic economic costsand also it social costsare externalized by the petrochemical and plastic manufacturing industry and are borne by citizen taxpayer and government in country around the world without compensation social justice finding the adverse effect of plastic and plastic pollution on human health the economy and the environment are not evenly distributed they disproportionately affect poor disempowered and marginalized population such a worker racial and ethnic minority fenceline community indigenous group woman and child all of whom had little to do with creating the current plastic crisis and lack the political influence or the resource to address it plastic harmful impact across it life cycle are most keenly felt in the global south in small island state and in disenfranchised area in the global north social and environmental justice sej principle require reversal of these inequitable burden to ensure that no group bear a disproportionate share of plastic negative impact and that those who benefit economically from plastic bear their fair share of it currently externalized cost conclusion it is now clear that current pattern of plastic production use and disposal are not sustainable and are responsible for significant harm to human health the environment and the economy a well a for deep societal injusticesthe main driver of these worsening harm is an almost exponential and still accelerating increase in global plastic production plastic harm are further magnified by low rate of recovery and recycling and by the long persistence of plastic waste in the environmentthe thousand of chemical in plasticsmonomers additive processing agent and nonintentionally added substancesinclude amongst their number known human carcinogen endocrine disruptors neurotoxicants and persistent organic pollutant these chemical are responsible for many of plastic known harm to human and planetary health the chemical leach out of plastic enter the environment cause pollution and result in human exposure and disease all effort to reduce plastic hazard must address the hazard of plasticassociated chemical recommendation to protect human and planetary health especially the health of vulnerable and atrisk population and put the world on track to end plastic pollution by 2040 this commission support urgent adoption by the world nation of a strong and comprehensive global plastic treaty in accord with the mandate set forth in the march 2022 resolution of the united nation environment assembly uneainternational measure such a a global plastic treaty are needed to curb plastic production and pollution because the harm to human health and the environment caused by plastic plasticassociated chemical and plastic waste transcend national boundary are planetary in their scale and have disproportionate impact on the health and wellbeing of people in the world poorest nation effective implementation of the global plastic treaty will require that international action be coordinated and complemented by intervention at the national regional and local levelsthis commission urge that a cap on global plastic production with target timetable and national contribution be a central provision of the global plastic treaty we recommend inclusion of the following additional provisionsthe treaty need to extend beyond microplastics and marine litter to include all of the many thousand of chemical incorporated into plasticsthe treaty need to include a provision banning or severely restricting manufacture and use of unnecessary avoidable and problematic plastic item especially singleuse item such a manufactured plastic microbeadsthe treaty need to include requirement on extended producer responsibility epr that make fossil carbon producer plastic producer and the manufacturer of plastic product legally and financially responsible for the safety and endoflife management of all the material they produce and sellthe treaty need to mandate reduction in the chemical complexity of plastic product healthprotective standard for plastic and plastic additive a requirement for use of sustainable nontoxic material full disclosure of all component and traceability of component international cooperation will be essential to implementing and enforcing these standardsthe treaty need to include sej remedy at each stage of the plastic life cycle designed to fill gap in community knowledge and advance both distributional and procedural equitythis commission encourages inclusion in the global plastic treaty of a provision calling for exploration of listing at least some plastic polymer a persistent organic pollutant pop under the stockholm conventionthis commission encourages a strong interface between the global plastic treaty and the basel and london convention to enhance management of hazardous plastic waste and slow current massive export of plastic waste into the world leastdeveloped countriesthis commission recommends the creation of a permanent science policy advisory body to guide the treaty implementation the main priority of this body would be to guide member state and other stakeholder in evaluating which solution are most effective in reducing plastic consumption enhancing plastic waste recovery and recycling and curbing the generation of plastic waste this body could also assess tradeoff among these solution and evaluate safer alternative to current plastic it could monitor the transnational export of plastic waste it could coordinate robust oceanic land and airbased mnp monitoring programsthis commission recommends urgent investment by national government in research into solution to the global plastic crisis this research will need to determine which solution are most effective and costeffective in the context of particular country and assess the risk and benefit of proposed solution oceanographic and environmental research is needed to better measure concentration and impact of plastic 10 microm and understand their distribution and fate in the global environment biomedical research is needed to elucidate the human health impact of plastic especially mnps summary this commission find that plastic are both a boon to humanity and a stealth threat to human and planetary health plastic convey enormous benefit but current linear pattern of plastic production use and disposal that pay little attention to sustainable design or safe material and a near absence of recovery reuse and recycling are responsible for grave harm to health widespread environmental damage great economic cost and deep societal injustice these harm are rapidly worseningwhile there remain gap in knowledge about plastic harm and uncertainty about their full magnitude the evidence available today demonstrates unequivocally that these impact are great and that they will increase in severity in the absence of urgent and effective intervention at global scale manufacture and use of essential plastic may continue however reckless increase in plastic production and especially increase in the manufacture of an everincreasing array of unnecessary singleuse plastic product need to be curbedglobal intervention against the plastic crisis is needed now
